You join me and you live.” Tang Xiu said, “Refuse and you’ll die a tragic death. Then I’ll prop up another man as the boss of this place.\"</p><p>Pfft…</p><p>Hei Long couldn’t help chuckling as he stared at Tang Xiu as if looking at an idiot. He had heard many jokes before, but none of them was funnier this one.</p><p>“Tell me, little brother, are you fucking stupid? This Hei Long has been here for a long time, and I always get whatever I want. This place is nice and cozy. Moreover, I’m a local tyrant. Why the hell should I join you? And how old are you, anyway?”</p><p>“So, you don’t want to?” Tang Xiu narrowed his eyes.</p><p>The smile on Hei Long’s face quickly vanished. A cold light shined in his eyes as he growled, “Get the hell out and go back to where you spawned. This Big Daddy is in a good mood today. I won’t bicker with you.”</p><p>Pointing to the two men around Hei Long, Tang Xiu indifferently asked, “Are those two your men?”</p><p>\"Yes!\" replied Hei Long with a cold expression.</p><p>Tang Xiu nodded his head as a Mitsubishi army knife appeared in his hand in an instant. His figure flashed as a dazzling cold light flashed. The two big men’s bodies turned stiff as they quickly grabbed their own throats.</p><p>Blood splashed out!</p><p>Their eyes glared wide along with disbelief within. They could feel their life rapidly draining away.</p><p>Standing beside Guo Sen, Shao Qiang’s body slightly quivered as his pupils instantly flashed. Tang Xiu’s speed made all the fine hair all over his body to stand.</p><p>Too fast! Way too fast!</p><p>The time Tang Xiu spent since his bottom left the sofa, dashed to strike Hei Long’s two men in front, and then returned to the sofa again, was no more than two seconds.</p><p>This speed… was simply frightening!</p><p>Shao Qiang could say that his speed was pretty fast. But he was horrified to find out that his speed was like day and night compared to Tang Xiu’s. If Tang Xiu wanted to kill him, he was simply powerless to resist.</p><p>Hei Long abruptly stood, his complexion drastically changing. He took out his pistol from his waist and aimed its muzzle at Tang Xiu. While glancing at the miserable appearances of his two men whose throats were sliced off, his heart convulsed violently several times as roared, “Who the fuck are you?!”</p><p>Deep fear was bred inside his heart! He couldn’t see clearly any of Tang Xiu’s actions. It was almost an instant’s effort as Tang Xiu cut off the throats of his two men. With such a speed, if Tang Xiu wanted to kill him just now, he would’ve ended just like his two men.</p><p>“Do you really think the gun in your hand is a threat to me?” Tang Xiu shook his head and said, “Put it down and join me! You have one last chance to submit to me. Be my underling and you may live. Perhaps you’ll have good fortune in the future if you accept it. Refuse, and I don’t mind  sending you along with these two brothers of yours.”</p><p>Recalling the moment Tang Xiu acted just now, Hei Long was aghast and overwhelmed with shock. The terrifying speed of this young man before him would perhaps enable him to avoid bullets!</p><p>In an instant, he watched the two men falling to the floor. Ten seconds after, they stopped breathing and died.</p><p>“You have yet to choose! Live or die, choose!” said Tang Xiu said indifferently.</p><p>Hei Long’s wrist shivered as he quietly stuffed the pistol back at his waist. With an indignant expression, he stared at Tang Xiu and growled lowly, “You killed my brothers. I may submit to you outwardly, but are you not afraid that I’ll get revenge on you from behind?”</p><p>“You can’t and you won’t!” Tang Xiu shook his head and said, “Though you may be ruthless, yet you’re afraid of death. Killing you is as easy as pinching an ant if I want to. Even my men can easily kill you without me lifting a hand. Of course, that also includes all of your brothers; one night is enough to make them see a bloodbath.”</p><p>While pointing at the Guo Sen duo, Hei Long asked in a deep tone, “You mean them?”</p><p>“These two are not my people.” Tang Xiu said dully, “Though the big boss behind them can also kill you easily. But since he’s not a native here, he simply won’t bother. The reason why I came to find you is due to a special reason. Else, let alone with your strength now, even if your forces get a hundred times stronger, I wouldn’t have even bothered looking at you.”</p><p>Hei Long’s breathing came to halt as he contemplated for a moment before solemnly saying, “I must know your background, else I can’t join you.”</p><p>Tang Xiu was silent for a while. After which, he slowly said, “In actuality, given your status and capacity, I’m afraid such a nobody like you wouldn’t know me even if I told you. However, I can tell you a fact. You watch TV news like the first channel of China TV, yes?”</p><p>“I couldn’t care less about the state affairs.” Hei Long shook his head and said, “Besides, what am I gonna see it for? I did see it when I was a child, though.”</p><p>“I also saw it when I was small.” Tang Xiu said, “Anyhow, I come from Beijing, and Tang Guosheng is my grandfather.”</p><p>Beijing? Tang Guosheng?</p><p>His eyes suddenly staring wide, Hei Long’s body swayed as he collapsed on the sofa, stunned. How could he not know about Tang Guosheng? The man was one of the bigwigs of the country… a grand figure…</p><p>A tinge of a smile was revealed on Tang Xiu’s face as he said, “Seems like you know the identity of my grandfather. Though I don’t rely on him, it’s rather useful to prove my background. So, how about it? Are you willing to join me?”</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>Jumping up from the sofa, it was as though he had forgotten that Tang Xiu had just killed two of his trusted men. With a face full of excitement, he said, “I’m very willing to join you.”</p><p>He realized that he had just hit big luck.</p><p>A young master from Beijing! A figure that numerous people want to bootlick. Though he was clueless why would Tang Xiu—such a dignified scion of a respected big family—run to a small place such as Guan City, he wouldn’t give up on such an opportunity.</p><p>“You’re not afraid I’m deceiving you?” Said Tang Xiu smilingly.</p><p>“I don’t think you will.” Said Hei Long seriously, “After all, you want me to work for you, so you won’t lie. Nonetheless, lying is very easy to be exposed. I can easily figure it out if I conduct a bit of investigation.”</p><p>“Well, looks like you’re really smart.” Said Tang Xiu smilingly, “No wonder you can spring up in this place. Anyways, get some people to clean up these two and then come with me!”</p><p>“Where?” Asked Hei Long.</p><p>“Ask what you should ask, but don’t ask what you don’t need to ask.” Tang Xiu said, “Shortly put, do bear in mind that you must execute anything I command you. If you do well, you’ll have great progress in the future and you won’t have to drown yourself as a local tyrant in this place. Perform mediocrely, and I’ll directly abandon you.”</p><p>“I’ll keep it in mind,” Said Hei Long with a vivid respect.</p><p>Two minutes afterward, Hei Long brought several of his trusted men and ordered them to secretly pack the two dead bodies and covertly destroy them. After finishing it, he then came before Tang Xiu respectfully.</p><p>“Let’s go!” said Tang Xiu lightly.</p><p>When this group of people left Black Dragon Bar, Tang Xiu looked at Guo Sen and said, “I need to borrow your intelligence network for the time being to help me monitor Hongpo District. Report to me immediately if any suspicious people arrive.”</p><p>“Mr. Tang, there are many suspicious people in this place.” Guo Sen forced a smile and said, “Shouldn’t we have a specific target?”</p><p>After being silent for a moment, Tang Xiu lightly said, “Look out for the Sun Family’s people of Guangyang.”</p><p>The Sun Family?</p><p>Guo Sen’s eyes flashed, “I’ll need to report this matter to the big boss first. After all, my rank is very low and I don’t have much knowledge about the Sun Family in Guangyang. I need a member of a higher rank to coordinate with me!”</p><p>“Report it then. I’ll personally visit your big boss tomorrow.” Said Tang Xiu.</p><p>“Alright!” Guo Sen nodded.</p><p>“Leave your car to us! Additionally, get some men to clean up some rooms in the factory. Also, help me buying some daily necessities while convenient. Keep in mind that you must not attract any attention.” Said Tang Xiu.</p><p>“No problem,” said Guo Sen with a smile.</p><p>Tang Xiu waved toward Hei Long, motioning for him to sit with the other bodyguards in another car. After which, he entered the SUV.</p><p>At this time, Hei Long’s mood was quite complex. He was tensed up yet excited. He didn’t know what destiny awaited him in the future, but still, he wanted to fight for it. If his choice were correct, he would have a bright future ahead, but if it was wrong… worst come to worst, he would die. After all, he would have become a corpse today if he had declined Tang Xiu’s offer.</p><p>Red Maple Villa Complex.</p><p>As the two cars parked a kilometer away from the Red Maple Villa Complex, Tang Xiu and Xue Jie had a discussion as to decide whether they’d withdraw to Hongpo District, taking advantage of the curtain of the night.</p><p>“Auntie Xue, wait for me here! I’ll go inside!”</p><p>“OK!”</p><p>Tang Xiu jumped over the wall alone and quickly returned to the villa.</p><p>At this time, Tang Wei hadn’t rest yet. He was worrying about Tang Xiu’s safety, so he sat before the window on the second floor, smoking. He was startled upon seeing a silhouette jumping over the wall into the courtyard and dozens of men quickly pulled out their guns to aim at the figure.</p><p>\"It's me!\" Tang Xiu called out in a sinking tone.</p><p>After more than the dozens of big men could see Tang Xiu clearly, they immediately put their guns away and scattered to various sides.</p><p>“Everyone, pack up! We’ll leave this place tonight.” Said Tang Xiu in a deep tone.</p><p>“Understood!” Replied several big men.</p><p>Following that, Tang Xiu went to the first floor of the villa as Tang Wei rushed down the stairs.</p><p>“How was it, Brother?”</p><p>“Everything’s done. I’ve visited the Bai Family’s people and also have found another hiding place for us to stay there for a while. Clean and tidy up, we’ll be leaving shortly.” Said Tang Xiu.</p><p>“With you handling the matter it makes me feel at ease.” Tang Wei nodded.</p><p>A smile outlined on the corner of Tang Xiu’s mouth as he smilingly said, “Do you wanna have another go?”</p><p>“What’s up?” asked Tang Wei, puzzled.</p><p>While pointing toward the villa complex gate, Tang Xiu said, “Should my guess be correct, someone must be monitoring our villa. We left by jumping over the wall before, so they unable to find us. Since we’ll move on a large scale, it won’t do without cars! Hence, we need to clean up the enemies monitoring us.”</p><p>“It’s too difficult!” Tang Wei shook his head and said, “We are in the open, while those monitoring us are in the dark. Wanting to find them is very difficult!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
