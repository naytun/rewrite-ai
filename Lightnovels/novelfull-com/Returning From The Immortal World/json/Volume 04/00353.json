Li Xiaojie looked icy as he received a phone call. After getting further instructions, a smile finally emerged on his cold face.</p><p>“What’s the news, Captain?” A youth on the front seat asked.</p><p>“The deputy director has been rescued. This Earth Cabinet Factory is, in fact, a trap; they hid the man in another place. The enemy must have assigned tons of manpower inside and are waiting for us to jump into their trap!”</p><p>“He’s been rescued? Who did it?” The youth asked, astonished.</p><p>“I don’t know. Chief Xue didn’t tell me.” Said Li Xiaojie.</p><p>The young man nodded and asked, “Then what should we do next? Shall we retreat?”</p><p>“We can’t.” Li Xiaojie shook his head and said, “Chief Xue said to wait here. She will catch up with us and then we’ll begin an attack on this place.”</p><p>“We clearly know that this is a trap. Why we must jump into it?” asked the young man, puzzled.</p><p>“Haven’t you heard the saying of the mantis stalking the cicada, yet unaware of the oriole behind? I’m afraid we’ve already been exposed the moment we arrived here. So we can only act as bait. After the following force arrives, only then can we start to act.”</p><p>Ring, ring, ring…</p><p>The moment Li Xiaojie finished speaking, his mobile’s ringtone sounded. After answering it, as he spoke some words with the caller, the smile on his face got thicker, “Big Boss has just phoned. He is bringing some people and rushing over here. Additionally, there’s two more coming alongside Chief Xue; one of which is Tang Wei, and the other one is Tang Xiu.”</p><p>“I know Tang Wei, but who’s this Tang Xiu?” Asked the young man, confused.</p><p>“Have you forgotten that the Tang Family found their missing child? That person is exactly this Tang Xiu. As far as I know, this person is very powerful; he was even able to revive a person in a vegetative stage.” Said Li Xiaojie.</p><p>Realization suddenly dawned upon the young man, “From the looks of it, our mission will be quite heavy! We must attack the enemy on one hand, while we must also protect these two young masters.”</p><p>Though keeping silent in response, Li Xiaojie had the same thought. After all, the direct line of the Tang Family members, especially the younger generations, were only pampered scions who did not have experience in a battle such as this.</p><p>Perhaps, to make the Big Boss personally bring people, wasn’t this obvious that he was worried about Tang Wei and Tang Xiu’s safety?</p><p>Meanwhile, four cars parked at the corner of the street behind the Earth Cabinet Factory. Giving Tang Wei a look, Tang Xiu then said seriously, “I’ll take a few people to scout the situation first. You’re to wait outside and keep in touch through the phone.”</p><p>“I’m going with you!” Said Tang Wei quickly.</p><p>“We can’t have too many people, lest we alert the enemy. Stay here and keep in touch with the vanguard group. I believe the enemy has set a trap here, so it’s evident that they should have the manpower to stay in the vicinity aside from the group in the inside. They’ve surely been monitoring our people who arrived earlier. Thus, we may have many enemies on the periphery.” Said Tang Xiu.</p><p>Tang Wei hesitated for a moment, before nodding and saying, “Then you gotta be careful.”</p><p>Smiling at him in response, Tang Xiu patted his shoulder and quickly opened the car’s door. He then went to the car behind them and knocked on its window, saying, “Three of you follow me. We’ll sneak into the cabinet factory.”</p><p>“I'll go!”</p><p>“I’m coming too!”</p><p>“Count me in!”</p><p>Aside from the driver, the other three opened the doors and came out. They were once soldiers. Thus, they had experienced special training and possessed very good abilities; hence, they were willing to follow Tang Xiu to investigate the situation. They considered themselves very strong, yet they dared not to think that they were on par with Tang Xiu.</p><p>They had witnessed Tang Xiu’s swiftness in killing. That smoothness, passing cloud and flowing water-like movements, killing techniques, as well as ruthlessness was something they admitted was unachievable for them.</p><p>A few minutes afterward, the four men silently appeared in the back wall of the Earth Cabinet Factory. Releasing his spiritual sense, Tang Xiu found no enemies nearby. He immediately jumped on top of the wall and quickly entered inside. The other three also moved very fast as they agilely jumped off the wall and then hid behind a few piles of boards.</p><p>“All of you wait here. You must not leave this place without my command. I have a small target, so I’ll join with you after scouting a bit.”</p><p>Having whispered his command, he silently passed through a large pile of boards and quietly moved forward. About four to five minutes later, he observed through his spiritual sense and found a few groups of enemies consisting of ten people in each group hiding in a more concealed spot inside the warehouse.</p><p>Moreover, what made his brows furrow was the situation in front, nearby the office building. There were dozens of big men armed with firearms and machetes there. Many people were also on the roof; while the one that aroused his killing intent was unexpectedly the presence of a big foreigner.</p><p>Tang Xiu had heard that a powerful character of the Yao Family, the guy called Yao Xinhua, had just come back from abroad and brought back with him a few foreigner experts. He guessed that this big foreigner was also one of the experts Yao Xinhua had brought back from abroad.</p><p>There’s no feasible way to take care of the enemies inside the office building and on the roof in advance. But those three squads hiding inside the warehouse can be wiped out ahead of time. However, it’ll probably be very difficult if I have to take care of those ten by myself silently.</p><p>Tang Xiu thought for a while as he maintained high vigilance and quietly return to the hiding spot where the three bodyguards he had brought with him were.</p><p>“One of you return and tell the others to come inside. Do remember to quickly jump over the wall. There’s someone holding a binocular observing the outside on top of that office building’s roof. Were he to catch a sight of you accidentally, I’m afraid our raiding plan will fail.”</p><p>“I’ll go.” Said a middle-aged man.</p><p>Seven or eight minutes afterward, Tang Wei, quietly leading the other five bodyguards, arrived at Tang Xiu’s side. After hiding themselves, he whispered, “Brother, how is the situation inside?”</p><p>“I’ve scouted the situation inside the two workshops on the left and right sides. There are ten people inside each building while another group of ten men is hiding behind the pile of boards over there. Two men in each of these three groups are armed with guns while the rest are armed with blades and sticks. However, there are dozens others inside the office building and on its roof. We have to take care of these three groups first and immediately inform the rest of our people outside to quickly come in and surround them. Regardless of how many people the Yao Family has made arrangements for, we can aim the spearhead toward the enemy outside at once as long as we can take care of all the enemies inside the cabinet factory.”</p><p>“Brother, you have investigated it so clearly? Did you used to be a scout before?” asked Tang Wei, astounded.</p><p>“I might be even stronger than a scout. Well, all of you follow me and do pay attention to hide yourselves. Let’s finish the enemy group inside the factory on the left side first.” Said Tang Xiu with a smile.</p><p>“Go!”</p><p>A few minutes later, Tang Xiu and Tang Wei as well as the eight bodyguards carefully emerged outside the side door of the workshop on the left side. Since the workshop’s front door was the place where ten enemy men were hiding, hence, through the observation of his spiritual sense, Tang Xiu chose to enter through the side door and rush behind the enemies from the inside, killing them in surprise.</p><p>“After the nine of you have approached them, begin immediately and do it fast! I will personally take care of those two guys with guns. Accomplish this operation swiftly, we must never let those ten people inside send out any warnings!” Tang Xiu commanded in a whisper.</p><p>“Roger that!” Everyone replied with hand signals.</p><p>Quickly, with the aid of the obstruction from the furniture, all of them approached and stopped near the ten big men who were at the workshop’s entrance. Two among them were quietly watching any movements outside while the rest were sitting in their chairs, cleaning up their guns or playing with their machetes and sticks.</p><p>“Go!”</p><p>Tang Xiu shouted in a low voice. With the sudden flick of the tip of his toe, he rushed over as though a tiger pouncing on its prey. Within just two seconds, before the ten enemies were able to react, he dashed in front of the two men armed with guns as the Mitsubishi army knife in his hand pierced a big man’s throat. His body appeared in the back of another big guy the moment after, grabbing the man’s head and easily breaking his neck.</p><p>“Enemy!”</p><p>A big man jumped up from his chair while brandishing his machete.</p><p>Puff…</p><p>A sharp dagger pierced the big man’s heart from the back.</p><p>Tang Xiu flashed to the side. The moment he appeared in front of another big man, his Mitsubishi army knife pierced the man’s throat. Taking the knife out the instant after, he then stabbed the throat of another man on the left side.</p><p>Puff! Puff! Puff!</p><p>Knives slashed up and down. Tang Wei and the eight bodyguards moved extremely fast and striked the ten unprepared enemies. In just a few seconds’ time, the ten enemies inside the workshop were all killed. However, four of them were killed by Tang Xiu while the other six were jointly killed by Tang Wei and the others.</p><p>“It was so damn smooth!” Tang Wei said with a smile with satisfaction.</p><p>“It was indeed very smooth. But we have two group of enemies left in the next place.” Tang Xiu nodded and said, “I hope we can also kill all of them easily! However, we must keep one of them alive for the third group. I need to know how many people the enemy has assigned for us in this trap.”</p><p>“You mean… there are also others outside aside from the ones inside the cabinet factory?” asked Tang Wei.</p><p>“I already scouted the enemy inside, but I don’t know how many enemies are outside. So we have to figure it out.” Said Tang Xiu.</p><p>“Brother, your Kung Fu is awesome. Just kill them right away, leave the task of having one of them alive to me!” said Tang Wei.</p><p>“Don’t lower your guard! Work with the others and try to come out unscathed in the following two battles.” Said Tang Xiu.</p><p>“Let’s proceed to the next one. Shall we go to that workshop?” asked Tang Wei.</p><p>“Yeah!” said Tang Xiu.</p><p>Quickly, two bodyguards took the pistols from two enemies’ hands. Back when they were in the Flat Out Skating Rink, they had killed six people and acquired four pistols. They now got two more, totaling six pistols altogether. With the gun Tang Min had gifted Tang Xiu, they now had seven pistols in their possession.</p><p>Four of Xue Jie’s bodyguards also held a gun each, so now their group of ten had eleven pistols.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
