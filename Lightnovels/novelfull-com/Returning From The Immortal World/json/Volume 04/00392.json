The materials had all been transported. Two of which were taken to the garage and the rest were piled up in the yard. During this time, Chi Nan had to supervise dozens of porters.</p><p>As for Kang Xia, because she had bought an evening airplane ticket, Tang Xiu could only ask Chi Nan to send her to the airport, since he didn’t have time.</p><p>Everything was ready.</p><p>Tang Xiu lit up a cigarette. After taking a puff, he went to the second floor to take a bath and then went to sleep for four or five hours. He then went to the study room, where the yellow paper and cinnabar ink were piled up.</p><p>True Fire was needed if one wanted to refine tools.</p><p>After Tang Xiu employed magical arts to create True Fire, he found that his star force within his body could only last for half an hour. Relying on it to release True Fire for refining tools was simply impossible.</p><p>Therefore, he could only use other means, that was, by using True Fire Symbol. Nevertheless, it would require a lot of continuous star force support for the refining process to finish.</p><p>All day, for the next two days, aside from going out to grab a bite, Tang Xiu only rested for two hours, while the rest of his time was used to craft True Fire Symbols or to restore the consumed star force. It was not until the third morning when he finally made 108 True Fire Symbols.</p><p>“Each True Fire Symbol can last for four hours. These 108 True Fire Symbols should be able to last more than 400 hours. It should be enough.”</p><p>Taking all True Fire Symbols, Tang Xiu then went to the courtyard. He found two experts from the Everlasting Feast Hall waiting there.</p><p>“Your duty is to guard the courtyard. Regardless of anyone, you must not let them disturb me! Remember, if some people are too headstrong, don’t rashly hurt them.” Tang Xiu asked Chi Nan to assign these two core experts here to protect him.</p><p>“Affirmative!”</p><p>The Everlasting Feast Hall’s two core experts nodded simultaneously.</p><p>Tang Xiu hesitated. He didn’t feel a bit relieved. As far as he was concerned, there must be neither interruption nor disturbance, otherwise, it may lead to failure, thus wasting the precious materials for nothing. It didn’t matter to him if the wasted materials were only the ordinary ones. But he absolutely couldn’t afford to lose those three precious ores.</p><p>“Where’s Chi Nan?”</p><p>“Chief Chi is at the restaurant, Boss.”</p><p>“Call her here, too. I’m going to sleep first. I want to see her when I wake up!” Tang Xiu said.</p><p>After giving the order, Tang Xiu then straighly slept for 12 hours. When he woke up from his deep sleep, the star force inside his body that had been consumed was already recovered. As he went downstairs, Chi Nan, who had long been waiting for him, helped him to get some food. After eating, he then said with a smile, “Tell them to guard this place for me. I’m still a bit uneasy because of what I’m gonna do next is very important. So I also want you to stay here and personally guard me.”</p><p>“Don’t worry, Boss. I’ll absolutely stay here on guard.” Chi Nan exclaimed.</p><p>Nodding with a smile in a response, Tang Xiu then walked out of the door. After arriving at the garage, he directly turned on the lights and then closed the garage door that was facing the sun.</p><p>“Out!”</p><p>As Tang Xiu waved his hand, the Demon God Spirit Devourer Cauldron directly flew out. Tang Xiu hit it with his palms few times. The cauldron immediately turned bigger. In an instant, it turned into a two meters high cauldron.</p><p>“First is refining the iron and copper essence, and then forging the ordinary ores.”</p><p>Crafting an interspatial ring was a big project for the current Tang Xiu. Hundreds of tons of materials were needed to fully extract the essence. He had estimated that those materials could only be purified into a fist-sized essence at best, which only then could it be used to refine tools.</p><p>“True Fire Symbol, burn…”</p><p>Tang Xiu put a True Fire Symbol into the cauldron. He then began cutting the fine iron piece by piece, each weighing a dozen pounds. Since he already had full control over the Demon God Spirit Devourer Cauldron, he was thus able to activate the array inside it.</p><p>At this moment, along with the True Fire Symbol burning, if anyone entered the Demon God Spirit Devourer Cauldron, they would definitely find that its inside was very big. It was bigger than what it looked from the outside. It was at least thousands of times bigger. Tang Xiu continuously threw the slickly cut iron and copper blocks, as well as the other materials, and threw them into the Demon God Spirit Devourer Cauldron.</p><p>Half an hour passed. The preheating of Demon God Spirit Devourer Cauldron had been finished. A layer of red, light ripples now covered the inside of the cauldron chamber, while materials began to smoke, even showing signs of melting.</p><p>Shuangqing Province, Star City.</p><p>Within the General Manager Office of the Magnificent Tang Corp’s HQ, Kang Xia was standing before the window with her arms crossed over her chest, watching the bustling scene outside.</p><p>Behind her were Scarblade Qiang and Su Quan, who looked a bit restless. Although they believed that Gods Nectar could definitely get a great start, yet they didn’t feel completely relieved. After all, they had yet to obtain news.</p><p>“Su Quan, how much time before the opening?” Kang Xia asked without turning back.</p><p>“There's 14 minutes before the stores all over the country cut the ribbon.” Su Quan said without thinking.</p><p>Kang Xia silently nodded.</p><p>She herself was, in fact, very nervous. As far as she was concerned, Gods Nectar was the first product sold by Magnificent Tang Corp. It was also related to the sensation caused by the company across the country. Thus, it would have a huge influence. If today was successful, she would execute her following plan, that was, listing the two cosmetic products, the Skin Care Lotion and the Scar Removal Cream on the market a week later. If these two products could also get good sales figures, she would also list the healthcare product produced by the company on the market a month later.</p><p>She had a big ambition. Within this second half of the year, she wanted more than half of the country’s population to frequently mention the Magnificent Tang Corp or the company’s products. She wanted to make it as everyone couldn’t help but raise their thumbs when they mentioned the Magnificent Tang Corp’s products.</p><p>Time passed by. Twenty minutes passed by in an instant.</p><p>Inside, Kang Xia, Scarblade Qiang, and Su Quan were silently waiting for the news. The petite Andy then rushed in and cried out, “Chief Kang, Beijing and Shanghai have just sent news. Our exclusive stores over there will soon be out of stock. The four stores in those two cities have all had their 20,400 bottles of Gods Nectar sold out in just a few minutes.”</p><p>Ding dong-</p><p>A notification sounded from Kang Xia’s mobile phone.</p><p>When she opened the WeChat and saw the video on the screen, a bright smile appeared on her beautiful face. The video footage was taken by the top management of the Magnificent Tang Corp. It was a video footage that recorded the situation in one of their provincial capital’s exclusive stores.</p><p>It was crowded!</p><p>The store’s entrance was fully crowded. Moreover, many people resorted to sucking up the guards, yet all along, there was no way to step into the store even half a step.</p><p>What was hot? This scene absolutely could be called as hot!</p><p>Scarblade Qiang and Su Quan quickly came forward to watch the video. Had it been the usual times, they would absolutely not dare to do it. After all, Kang Xia was someone with absolute authority in the Magnificent Tang Corp. But, at the moment, they couldn’t care less. They wanted to know how much was the final sales figure of Gods Nectar.</p><p>“Awesome!”</p><p>After seeing the video, Scarblade Qiang flung his arms and exclaimed, “My choice was absolutely wise. Before, I followed Boss here to Star City. Sure enough, he can really spread my wings here. Anyways, Chief Kang, do you want to add more production lines? Our winery can produce tens of thousands of boxes of Gods Nectar every month now, and I’m afraid our supply would fail to meet the demand later.”</p><p>Kang Xia’s expression moved. However, as she recalled the Hunger Sale plan devised by Tang Xiu, she finally repressed the thought. Shaking her head, she said, “No need. Our Magnificent Tang Corp have invested too much earlier on. Let’s do this slow and steady. We’ll wait for our money to flow back. We’ll discuss about production expansion later.”</p><p>Scarblade Qiang hesitated, then nodded and said, “Since Chief Kang is decided, we’ll do it as per your instructions!”</p><p>Su Quan’s eyes flashed, “Chief Kang, even if our Gods Nectar’s supply can’t meet the demand, I think we can still increase the production line once our funds have flowed back. After all, Gods Nectar is a wine, which is an easily consumed product. Besides, we are also forgetting one thing, and this time, we should make up for it.”</p><p>“What is it?” Kang Xia was surprised.</p><p>“Recently, after I conducted an independent analysis of our marketing, I found that most of our clients actually have inextricable relationship with the government. If there are people among the court officials who we can’t get along or are difficult to deal with, and they want to get some Gods Nectar from us through special relationship, if we were to refuse them, I’m afraid it would affect the operation of our group.”</p><p>Kang Xia stared blankly for a moment, before suddenly awakening. She then forced a smile and said, “If not for your reminder, I would have forgotten this issue. So be it then. You go back to the winery and immediately store up a thousand boxes of Gods Nectar. Even if all of our exclusive stores all over the country are in serious shortage, these thousand boxes of Gods Nectar must never be shipped out.”</p><p>“No problem. I’ll manage this!” Su Quan nodded.</p><p>Suddenly, he seemed to recall something and quickly said, “Chief Kang, can we send some of them to Beijing? Such as the Boss’s family…”</p><p>After hesitating for a moment, Kang Xia then nodded and said, “I’ll personally handle this matter. Go!”</p><p>“Understood!” Su Quan smiled and quickly left the office.</p><p>Scarblade Qiang didn’t leave yet. He was still waiting for the sales figures from the other cities’ exclusive stores. What made him pleasantly surprised was that, in half an hour, all the other cities’ exclusive stores had passed the news: All Gods Nectars have been completely sold out. There are countless people blocking the store outside, yelling that they must buy it. Many people even want to pay in advance, hoping that the wine can be given to them immediately should when next shipment arrives.”</p><p>“Refuse.” Kang Xia passed down the order.</p><p>The restlessness inside Scarblade Qiang’s heart finally disappeared. He looked at Kang Xia, grinning ear to ear, and said, “Chief Kang, do you have any other instructions for me? If not, I’ll go back to the winery.”</p><p>“Scarblade Qiang, you have done very well.” Kang Xia said with a smile, “Boss told me to reward you if our Gods Nectar achieved good results. Thus, you’ll receive double from this month onwards. And you’ll also receive the dividends from your share by the end of the year.”</p><p>“Thank you, Chief Kang.” Scarblade Qiang’s eyes turned bright, and said with a smile, “Please help me convey my gratitude to Big Boss.”</p><p>“Go!” Kang Xia waved her hand, and said with a smile, “A few days later, the Boss will probably come back here to give us a celebration party. Make preparations on your side, all right?”</p><p>“Affirmative!” The smile on Scarblade Qiang’s face turned thicker.</p><p>''</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
