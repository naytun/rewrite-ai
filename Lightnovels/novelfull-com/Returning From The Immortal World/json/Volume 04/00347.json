Then, a group of leaders led by Zhuge Wenfeng, two doctors, and many nurses fixated their eyes on the previous patient.</p><p>The man wasn’t bleeding?</p><p>A shocked expression could be seen on everyone’s faces.</p><p>Observing for more than ten seconds, Zhuge Wenfeng watched Tang Xiu’s back as the latter strode into the Emergency Room. He was shocked to the extreme. During his career of tens of years as a doctor, he had seen countless small and big cases as well as innumerable surgeries. Yet, never once had he ever seen such a case where the patient’s wound didn’t bleed.</p><p>In particular, back when Tang Xiu cut open the victim’s muscles to extract the broken bones from the lungs, it was definitely devoid of blood that normally should be gushing out.</p><p>Hu Qiubo’s lips quivered a few times as he murmured, “Back then, I saw him pressing on some spots around the patient’s wound. Could it be… he was using the Bloodstream Acupoints Sealing method?”</p><p>The Bloodstream Acupoints Sealing method?</p><p>Zhuge Wenfeng’s expression changed. He quickly asked, “Are you sure he pressed some acupoints around the victim’s wound?”</p><p>“Yeah, I was not the only who saw it, so were many others,” Hu Qiubo nodded solemnly.</p><p>Zhuge Wenfeng looked at the others and saw them nodding. He immediately chased after Tang Xiu. He wanted to observe Tang Xiu’s treatment methods, to verify how he did it.</p><p>In front of the operating room’s door on the second floor.</p><p>Seven or eight migrant workers gathered around a dozen nurses and argued loudly. They followed their workmates to the hospital and had been waiting anxiously, but the hospital didn’t have enough operating rooms. What made them the most furious was that the doctors only took the workers with light injuries into the operating rooms, while the other four workers with the most severe injuries had to wait outside.</p><p>“Please don’t get agitated! The order was issued by the hospital president himself. A very skillful doctor has come to our hospital and he will treat these last four patients personally. Also, please step back. If you gather around here, it will disturb the doctor’s treatment.” Said a nurse loudly.</p><p>A dark-skinned, thin middle-aged man shouted, “You’re not deceiving us, are you? Our brothers have the most serious injuries. Who’s this skillful doctor? Don’t you know that saving people is like fighting fire? If by any chance…”</p><p>\"No, there's no ifs!\"</p><p>A cold voice sounded behind them.</p><p>Tang Xiu broke open the crowd blocking him. Quickly circling around the patients on the four trolleys, he vision finally landed on one of the victims.</p><p>Cough, cough!</p><p>The wounded man coughed two mouthfuls of blood and suddenly sat up. A steel bar had pierced his chest, with about twenty centimeters of it exposed on the outside. The man then shouted with a strenuous effort, “…Z-Zhu Zhi… Z-Zhu Zhi!”</p><p>“Brother Daquan, I’m here!”</p><p>The dark-skinned, thin middle-aged man rushed over and quickly said, “Brother Daquan, please don’t speak. The doctor will be here right away.”</p><p>Bluish-green veins protruded on Daquan’s forehead. He tried hard to squeeze out a smile and said with extreme difficulty, “Z-Zhu Zhi… I… know… about… my injury… P-Please… promise… me… to take… care... of… my family…”</p><p>Big beads of tears uncontrollably gushed out from Zhu Zhi’s eyes, dripping down and wetting his clothes. He raised his hand to wipe his tears and loudly replied, “I know, I know, Brother Daquan. Please don’t worry. Your parents will be my parents from now on. I’ll definitely look after them until they grow old and arrange them a proper burial after they die… Xiu Lan and I will also help to look after elder sister-in-law and your child. You can rest assured…”</p><p>“T-Thanks … Brother…T-Thanks…”</p><p>Daquan coughed another mouthful of blood as his body softly fell down on the trolley.</p><p>Tang Xiu grabbed Daquan’s wrist. He could feel the life force quickly leaving the man’s body. Under his spiritual sense, he had already examined the man’s internal body condition. He saw that the man had a broken bone piercing his heart.</p><p>While shaking his head, Tang Xiu turned away to another wounded man at the side.</p><p>“Doctor! Where the fuck did that doctor go?”</p><p>Zhu Zhi’s eyes turned bloodshot and growled furiously.</p><p>Tang Xiu was examining another wounded man when Zhu Zhi roared. He shook his head and said, “There’s no way to save him. A piece of broken bone has pierced his heart.”</p><p>“Who the fuck are you, idiot?” Zhu Zhi howled.</p><p>“I’m saddened to say, but your brother has already passed away.” Tang Xiu’s expression turned cold, “But if you dare to speak insulting words at me again, I don’t mind watching the rest of your brothers die. Step aside, please. Otherwise, nobody else will treat them.”</p><p>Zhu Zhi’s breathing paused before he replied, “Are you the doctor?”</p><p>\"Yes!\" Tang Xiu said with a cold and detached tone.</p><p>Zhu Zhi waved to his other workmates, hinting to all of them to move backward.</p><p>The diagnosis and treatment kept Tang Xiu busy for twenty minutes before he completely treated the other three severely injured victims. What he could do was preserve their lives. Hence, it wouldn’t be a problem to leave their post-treatment recuperation and rehabilitation to the hospital.</p><p>“You’re President Zhuge, right? Their lives are no longer in danger, so I’ll hand over the post-treatment issues to your hospital. Also, I’ll take my leave since I still have another matter to attend to.”</p><p>After having observed all the diagnosis and treatment methods performed by Tang Xiu, Zhuge Wenfeng was still unable to make sense of what he had witnessed. It was too mysterious. The treatment used Traditional Chinese Medical methods; this field was not within his expertise. Thus, upon hearing that Tang Xiu was about to leave, he hesitated for a moment before he finally replied, “Divine Doctor Tang, could you wait a bit longer? Many wounded are currently undergoing surgery in the operating room now. I’m afraid of some problems arising.”</p><p>“The surgeries are currently being handled by the other doctors. But you want me to deal with the problem again should something go wrong? President Zhuge, you’re just talking in a roundabout way, aren’t you?! I know what you’re worried about. You’re afraid that I didn’t cure them and am only wasting time for them to be saved, no? Hehe… Fine, I’ll give you my number. You can contact me directly should any problems arise.”</p><p>Having his thoughts nakedly exposed, Zhuge Wenfeng looked a bit awkward and embarrassed. However, as experienced as he was, his awkward expression quickly disappeared as he forced a smile and said, “Divine Doctor Tang, please don’t misunderstand me. You have superb medical skills, while I also have observed your treatment methods you performed on the victims. How can I think that? The reason I wanted you to stay was that I once thought of visiting you in Star City Chinese Medical Hospital before. But President Li Hongji denied me back then.”</p><p>“Why did you want to see me?” asked Tang Xiu with a doubtful expression.</p><p>“Don’t tell me you don’t know that you’re already quite famous as a Grandmaster in the medical field? It was not only me. Lots of others also went to Star City personally, only to return disappointed.”</p><p>“President Zhuge, I hope you won’t spread the matter about me treating the victims here at First Public Hospital.” Tang Xiu creased his brows and said, “I’m currently studying at Shanghai University, so I don’t have time to receive anyone, nor I want any burden and troublesome matters.”</p><p>“I understand.” Zhuge Wenfeng nodded and said, “Our hospital’s doctors and nurses absolutely won’t disclose anything about this matter. You can rest assured!”</p><p>Nodding to him in response, Tang Xiu gave his cell number to Zhuge Wenfeng and quickly left the hospital.</p><p>Half an hour later, the five victims who had been treated by Tang Xiu had been examined using medical instruments. The doctor in charge of the examination put the medical reports on Zhuge Wenfeng’s desk. However, the shocked expression on his face hadn’t yet subsided.</p><p>“Those seriously injured victims’ conditions are stabilizing and their injuries are no longer life-threatening. There’s one thing beyond comprehension, though. It’s about the victim with the lungs trauma. His wound is actually in the process of being healed at a very fast rate.”</p><p>Zhuge Wenfeng picked up the examination reports. After reading it slowly and carefully, he couldn’t help sighing in praise, “He indeed deserves to be called as the young Divine Doctor who has created a sensation in the medical world. Even his methods of treating those victims are not something I can hope to achieve! The most obvious characteristic of those five victims is their excessive blood loss. If our doctors performed surgery on them, I’m afraid that their chance of living would be no more than 10%!”</p><p>The doctor sighed in approval and praise, “That’s right! It’s very fortunate to have him act today. Or else, I’m afraid…”</p><p>Zhuge Wenfeng waved his hand, “Do you remember what he said before he left? Nevertheless, since he doesn’t want to be famous in our place, then we mustn’t do anything against his will and make things difficult for him. In any case, don’t announce the content of these reports to the others. And notify the other doctors and nurses to not talk too much about this matter.”</p><p>“Understood!” The doctor complied and then turned to leave the office.</p><p>While sitting in his office chair, Zhuge Wenfeng thought for a while. He then took out his mobile and dialed Li Hongji’s cell number.</p><p>“Hello, President Li! It’s Zhuge Wenfeng.”</p><p>“Ah, President Zhuge, how is the situation over there?”</p><p>“President Li, I have to say something. The medical skills of that young Divine Doctor—Tang Xiu, are really amazing. Never have I seen the likes of it in the entirety of my life. I finally understood now why he caused such a big sensation even though he only worked at your Star City Chinese Medical Hospital for a short time.”</p><p>Li Hongji laughed, “Of course I know that his medical skills level is amazing. To be honest with you, I’m even willing to give him my hospital president seat if he could work at our Star City Chinese Medical Hospital every day.”</p><p>Zhuge Wenfeng’s expression changed. He smiled and said, “President Li, how about having a small talk between us? You know Tang Xiu is currently studying at Shanghai University, right? Since our First Public Hospital is near his campus, could you let Tang Xiu come to work at our hospital? You can count it as Zhuge Wenfeng owing you a big a favor as long as you agree.”</p><p>Poaching?</p><p>Li Hongji fell into silence for a while before he replied in a bitter tone, “President Zhuge, it’s not like I don’t want you to owe me a big favor. But I can’t do that. The reason as to why Tang Xiu was willing to come and give medical services in our Star City Chinese Medical Hospital was because I begged him over and over. So, if he’s willing to go to Shanghai First Public Hospital and work there, I naturally have nothing to say about it.”</p><p>“President Li, you mean the initiative is in Tang Xiu’s hands? Hahaha… I see.” Laughed Zhuge Wenfeng in a clear voice. “Anyway, I have to say thanks to you, President Li! Anyhow, when you have some time, please come to Shanghai. I’ll invite you to drink some nice wine.”</p><p>“No problem! No problem!” Said Li Hongji with a few words.</p><p>In the President Office of Star City Chinese Medical Hospital, Li Hongji’s expression turned gloomy after he hung up the phone. He was quite depressed since Zhuge Wenfeng basically wanted to poach Tang Xiu. But he also knew that he didn’t have any rights to restrain Tang Xiu’s choice. Despite the fact that Tang Xiu could be considered as a Star City Chinese Medical Hospital’s doctor, it was because he used both hard and soft means to beg and pester Tang Xiu until he came to work there.</p><p>He was a bit worried.</p><p>If by any chance Tang Xiu were to be poached by Zhuge Wenfeng, would Tang Xiu still want to stay at Star City Chinese Medical Hospital later? How many times would he be able to come and give medical services by then?</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
