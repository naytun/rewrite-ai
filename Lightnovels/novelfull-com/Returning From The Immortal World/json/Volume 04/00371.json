However, today, except for those who were outside of town and couldn’t catch up, the rest had gathered here. Even Tang Xiu’s parents who had yet to return to Star City also came here.</p><p>“Have you heard the news? Our family has just bullied the Yao and Sun Families in Guangyang. They just suffered enormous losses in merely one night.”</p><p>“Yup. I got the news as well. Tang Xiu is indeed worthy as the offspring of our Tang Family. His methods were truly sound. Even last night, I heard father laughing for a long time.”</p><p>“Yunde, Lingyun, you two really have a good son! If it were not for him, I’m afraid that our family’s business in Guangyang would have been completely driven out.”</p><p>\"...\"</p><p>Tang Yunde’s smile was extraordinarily bright upon listening to the relatives who were amiably talking to him. On the contrary, Su Lingyun’s smile was rather forced, yet, she still forced herself to smile at everyone after taking Tang Yunde’s face into account.</p><p>“Little Yun, are you not happy?”</p><p>After discovering his wife's expression, Tang Yunde pulled her to a corner and whispered.</p><p>“It’s not like that. I’m just a bit worried.” Su Lingyun shook her head and said, “With so many relatives involved in the family’s important matter, I just can’t understand why did Xiu’er run to Guangyang to take charge of the overall situation. Though I don’t know anything about disputes between big families, but I heard it’s very gruesome. With so many people from the Yao and Sun families dead, I’m afraid Xiu’er would suffer an unexpected mishap. I…”</p><p>“Don’t worry! Xiu’er has done very well in Guangyang.” Tang Yunde gently hugged Su Lingyun and whispered, “It shows that he has grown up. Besides, there are things that he must go through sooner or later; he just encountered it ahead of time. Don’t you see that he’s well and good now? He called father just last night! I can’t say for sure, but last night, he led some people to scare off the Yao family.”</p><p>“Will the Yaos really be frightened?” Su Lingyun hesitated, “If they did, would the dispute between both parties be over?”</p><p>“It can be said that they wouldn’t for now. But I think it should be about the same.” Tang Yunde said with a smile, “The Yaos have no intention of losing all decorum with our family for now. The matters in Guangyang and Fukang are just they testing the waters to probe the cards in our hands.”</p><p>“Yunde, tell me. Should we go to Guangyang to support Xiu’er?” Su Lingyun was a bit relieved as she nodded and said, “I’m afraid…”</p><p>“Don’t be afraid. He’s smart and brave.” Tang Yunde shook his head and said, “If he really can’t shoulder it, he will never force himself to do it in spite of adversity. Do you not see that everyone in the family looks happy? That shows that we have snatched a victory. Anyhow, I’ll ask father later to let Xiu’er go back to Shanghai right away after the matter has been concluded.”</p><p>“Yes, you must ask him.” Su Lingyun hurriedly nodded and said, “Xiu’er is a college student. Shanghai University is a good university, so he mustn’t delay his schooling.”</p><p>“Don’t worry!” Tang Yunde comforted.</p><p>Inside the ancestral residence, the two brothers—Tang Guosheng and Tang Guoshou were sitting face to face separated by a tea table. At this time, a slight smile was hunging on their old faces.</p><p>“Amazing, awesome!” Tang Guoshou exclaimed.</p><p>“Back when I agreed for him to take in charge in Guangyang, I actually didn’t have much hope.” Tang Guosheng nodded and said, “Even though the plan had already been completed and we expected to lose Guangyang, then so be it! Consider it tempering him. I didn’t expect that he would give me such a pleasant surprise. Unexpected…”</p><p>Ring, ring, ring…</p><p>A mobile phone’s ringtone sounded.</p><p>Connecting the phone, Tang Guosheng then heard the caller’s words. He suddenly stood in response and asked hurriedly, “Is that real? Bai Yang has been released? The first and second man of Guangyang Province signed and authorized it? Great, hahaha… I see.”</p><p>After hanging up the phone, Tang Guosheng joyfully said, “The Bai Family’s head, Bai Yang, has been released. It’s truly unexpected! I really didn’t expect it! What Xiu’er did yesterday shocked the number one and two. They probably did it as not to let any conflict resurgence between us, the Yao and Sun families yet again. Thus, they released Bai Yang!”</p><p>“First Brother, don’t get muddle-headed due to the pleasant surprise.” Tang Guoshou squinted his eyes and slowly said, “I think the matter is not as simple as it looks. Logically speaking…. The number one and two men of Guangyang Province are not our people, though they are not the Yao’s either. Shouldn’t they also hope that we and the Yaos struggle to death?”</p><p>Tang Guosheng was briefly startled as the smile on his face quickly receded. After hesitating for a moment, he doubtfully asked, “Could it be that they don’t want a large-scale strife to emerge yet again in their region?”</p><p>“It’s quite unlikely, I think!” Tang Guoshou shook his head and said, “The Chus are the biggest family in Guangyang Province, while they and the number one figure in Guangyang have a close relationship with the neutral camp. They should not easily meddle in this matter. I actually thought… Does this matter have anything to do with Xiu’er?”</p><p>“Third Brother, aren’t you thinking too highly of Xiu’er?” Tang Guosheng shook his head and laughed, “He’s outstanding, I admit. But there’s no way he has the means to intervene in the bureaucracy, right? You, ah…”</p><p>Tang Guoshou was silent for a moment. He then took out his mobile and said, “I’ll call him and ask.”</p><p>Startled, Tang Guosheng involuntarily laughed and immediately said, “Since you think so, I’d like to hear about it as well. Call him!”</p><p>Half a minute later, Tang Guoshou dialed Tang Xiu’s number. He then smiled and said after Tang Xiu connected the phone, “Xiu’er, Third Grandpa here, where are you now?”</p><p>“I’m on the way back to Fukang Province.” Tang Xiu answered.</p><p>“Xiu’er I just got the news of what you did. It’s great and amazing.” Tang Guoshou smiled and said, ”The rampant and arrogant Yao Family could be said to have been knocked down by you.”</p><p>“Third Grandpa, you can’t be calling just to praise me, right? Please tell me if you have anything to say.” Said Tang Xiu with a smile.</p><p>“You’re really smart, kiddo…” Tang Guoshou laughed, “Anyhow, I have a small thing to ask you. The Bai Family’s head has been released this morning. He personally called your first grandpa. But, I’m very curious. Did it have anything to do with you?”</p><p>“Yeah, I made a deal with the Huang Family’s head in Fukang when I met him back then. As for the deal, Third Grandpa doesn’t need to ask. I guarantee that it won’t be detrimental to the Tang Family. It’s… just my other business deal, that’s all.”</p><p>Astounded, Tang Guoshou said, “The Huang Family’s head, Huang Jinfu, is able to influence the Chu Family’s top figure?”</p><p>“It was not only the Huangs I talked with, but also the Sus.” Tang Xiu said, “I don’t have a direct relationship with the Chus, though. So the best choice was to relate though Huang Jinfu, the Huang’s head.”</p><p>“How true is that heroes always come from youth since ancient times.” Tang Guoshou’s lips wriggled and sighed, “I’m impressed. Not many people in the world can make this old man impressed, but you did it. You’ve done things beautifully, truly great. Let’s have a drink when you come back to Beijing.”</p><p>“All right!” Tang Xiu said with a smile.</p><p>Hanging up the phone, Tang Guoshou then looked at Tang Guosheng’s strange expression and said, “First Brother, you just heard it, yes? I activated the speaker. It was indeed Tang Xiu’s doing for Bai Yang being able to come out. As for the deal between him and the Chu Family, I didn’t ask much since he didn’t want to say it.”</p><p>“Third Brother, did you realize something? Xiu’er is really too mysterious.” Tang Guosheng’s eyes sparkled as he muttered, “I suddenly have a hunch that he has many other secrets hidden from us.”</p><p>“Let him do as he wants!” Tang Guoshou grinned, “Regardless of how many secrets he doesn’t want us to know, he’s still an offspring of our Tang Family. He will never do anything to harm the family. I believe no one in our family will oppose even if you directly pass the head position of the Tang Family to him, so long as he has the ability and he’s willing to accept it.”</p><p>“You’re right. If he has the ability, the authority of the Family can be handed over to him in the future.” Tang Guosheng laughed, “How can he do something harmful to his own family, anyway? Well, let’s forget about it. If anything, don’t send anyone to investigate it. I believe he’ll tell us about it one day.”</p><p>“All right!”</p><p>Meanwhile, at the other side, while the Tang Family was celebrating, the Yao Family was in a gloomy mood.</p><p>Yao Qingzun looked ashen as silently sat in his study room for a few hours. It was not until noon that he finally strode out of the room.</p><p>“Chengqing, notify Liang Teng to come back. Also, send someone to visit the Tang Family. Tell them that we’re sending some tonics since the Tang’s old bastard is unwell.”</p><p>“Father, isn’t this just akin to admitting defeat?” Yao Chengqing’s face drastically changed as he hurriedly said, “Our losses in Guangyang are not large despite the Sun Family losing quite a great deal. Besides, we haven’t used our forces in Fukang yet. So, once we launch an assault from there, the odds of the Tang Family preserving their assets in Guangyang and Fukang Province are slim.”</p><p>“Yet, until now, you haven’t clearly investigated who took charge of Guangyang for the Tang Family.” Yao Qingzun snorted coldly and said, “With us knowing nothing about the enemy circumstances, how can we calculate our chances of victory if we continue to fight?”</p><p>“This…” Yao Qingcheng didn’t know how to answer.</p><p>Suddenly, Yao Qingcheng’s mobile’s ringtone rang. As he connected the call and listened to the other party’s words, he fell into silence.</p><p>“Really now. What happened again?”</p><p>Seeing his son’s silent expression, foreboding arose inside Yao Qingzun’s heart as he sonorously said.</p><p>“Bai Yang has been released.” Yao Qingcheng said bitterly, “The first and second figures of Guangyang signed and authorized it simultaneously. Furthermore, there were also some people speaking for him in Beijing.”</p><p>Yao Qingzun’s expression changed. He fell into silence for a good deal of time before he suddenly smiled, though rather unsightly, “What a good Tang Family, eh. Little did I think that they would conceal themselves so deeply. I’m afraid it would be a bit difficult to bring them down as long as that Tang’s old geezer has yet to die. Forget it! We’ve already tested the waters, anyway. Just do what I’ve told you before.”</p><p>“All right!” Yao Chengqing nodded silently.</p><p>As he was about to leave, Yao Qingzun shouted imposingly, “Remember, even if the battle over there is over, you must investigate clearly who was the person in charge of Guangyang Province.”</p><p>“Affirmative! I’ll do it according to your instructions.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
