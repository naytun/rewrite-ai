There was an awkward expression on his face. He then bitterly smiled, “Who would have thought that Tang Xiu would unexpectedly be this terrifying despite his young age?”</p><p>“Look, our position may look lofty compared with ordinary people. But in the eyes of some others, whether it is our status or wealth, what we have is nothing but a joke.” Gu Changmin said, “Those with inheritances spanning over a hundred years, for instance, or those several hundred years old families. They don’t fall and decline during the periods of great turmoil. They conceal their abilities and power, bidding for time, while silently developing their own forces. With so many years of accumulation, who knows to what kind of terrifying extent they would develop to?”</p><p>Li Haoran deeply pondered before he nodded and said, “You’re right. I was arrogant this time.”</p><p>“As a matter of fact, the root cause is still your son, to begin with.” Gu Changmin sighed, “Li Zhen was always spoiled since childhood. That shaped his character into an arrogant and domineering personality. I helped you in solving today’s matter, but what about next time? Once he provokes another big figure, how will your Li Family solve the problem then? Wouldn’t you be easily exterminated?”</p><p>Li Haoran looked a bit cold as he nodded, “Brother Gu, rest assured! I’ll put a leash on him later. I won’t hesitate even if I have to make him suffer.”</p><p>Gu Changmin nodded in a response.</p><p>Yet, there was a tinge of concern in Li Haoran’s eyes as he asked, “Brother Gu, what do you think about today’s matter? Is it really over like this? If Tang Xiu is a narrow-minded person…”</p><p>After a moment of silence, Gu Changmin slowly said, “If I were you, I would immediately inquire about his address, and then send compensation right away. There were some powerful families on par with your Li family that finally almost lost their families’ fortune paying compensation. It was all because they provoked Tang Xiu.”</p><p>Hiss… Li Haoran eyes turned saucer, and he couldn’t help inhaling cold air.</p><p>Immediately after, he dialed a number. He then asked in a deep voice, “How much liquid cash is available in our company right now? Hmmm… I got it. Transfer 600 million to me. I need it now.”</p><p>After ending the call, he shifted his vision to the middle-aged men surnamed Li and Gao. While looking at the horrified expression on their faces, he forced a bitter smile, “Two old friends, my Li Group can only transfer up to 600 million funds, while I myself am holding 200 million. Can you two lend me 200 million? I’ll return the money to you immediately once I get back my cash flow.”</p><p>The middle-aged man Li curiously asked, “You’re thinking of giving 1 billion to Tang Xiu as a token of apology?”</p><p>While looking at Gu Changmin, Li Haoran nodded and sighed, “I believe that Brother Gu and Jin Xingkui won’t lie to me. Yeah, I’m going to put forward 1 billion. Just consider it as a financial losses as to avoid calamity!”</p><p>The middle-aged men surnamed Li and Gao exchanged looks.</p><p>“We’ll take out 100 million each! If it’s not enough, do tell us.” The middle-aged man Li sighed.</p><p>Li Haoran looked at the two men with a grateful expression, “Three old friends, I’m afraid I can’t accompany you all to play mahjong tonight. Since I already owe you all a big favor, I must thicken my face to help me inquire about Tang Xiu’s residence. I’ll personally visit him.”</p><p>“No problem!”</p><p>“All right!”</p><p>The three men nodded simultaneously.</p><p>Bluestar Villa Complex.</p><p>Tang Xiu brought Kang Xia back here. In fact, it was Kang Xia who requested to come back here. Chi Nan and the Everlasting Feast Hall’s members directly returned to the restaurant when they were on the road.</p><p>“Boss, is this the place you’re living? What a impressive, stylish villa!” Kang Xia didn’t much interest in the villa. However, that was regarding someone else’s villa, and not the place Tang Xiu lived, for which she looked around to her heart’s content.</p><p>“My aunt gave me this villa!” Tang Xiu let out a pale smile and said, “I will probably stay on campus after Shanghai University’s new term formally starts. I’ll stay here whenever I can, though.”</p><p>“I really doubt you can live in a campus, eh?” Kang Xia laughed.</p><p>Laughing involuntarily, Tang Xiu replied, “Don’t underestimate me. I have been through hard times, yet I managed to cross them over. Let alone the university dorm, I can live well even if you give me a shed.”</p><p>Kang Xia let out a charming laugh. Winding her arms around his waist, she then said in a low voice, “A man I fancy is truly a dragon among men. Do you know that I have never been in love before? I didn’t know how it felt like falling in love with a man. But since… after ‘that’, I’m always missing you every day; pondering about what you’re doing; wondering whether you ate or not; wondering whether you slept... Now, I finally realize that loving someone will make me worry and want to see them.”</p><p>Tang Xiu was silent for a moment, before secretly sighing inside. He reached out his hand to caress her elegant long hair and softly said, “You should understand that I can’t you give you a marriage. Neither can I completely, fully love you.”</p><p>Kang Xia looked up, her pair of bright eyes fixated on Tang Xiu. She asked, “Can you tell me why is that? Did you had… any emotional traumas before?”</p><p>Tang Xiu avoided Kang Xia’s eyes. He gently pushed her away, and slowly walked to the second floor. After entering his room, he took out a bottle of wine from the wine cooler, poured it into two cups and handed one to Kang Xia, who had followed behind him. He then turned to the balcony, watching the dim lights outside, and the dancing shadows of the trees. Only then did he speak in a low voice, “I used to be someone who was never good at expressing my feelings. But when one is in love with someone, that person will be subjected to genuine affection. There’s one thing I don’t wish to understand. For that, too, I don’t want to think over about feelings between lovers. In the future, perhaps I will also give my heart to someone. But it’s not now…”</p><p>Kang Xia understood what Tang Xiu meant. She gently held his arm and said, “According to you what you said when you taught me that cultivation technique, I could really live for a very long time. If so, I’m confident that I’ll be able to pry open your closed heart, and truly get to your heart.”</p><p>Tang Xiu shook his head and sighed, “There are many outstanding men in the world. Why do you…”</p><p>With all seriousness, Kang Xia interrupted him, “There are indeed a lot of outstanding men in the world, but no one is better than you. You’re my first man, and you will be my last.”</p><p>“But I can’t give you a family in the future.” Tang Xiu sighed.</p><p>“I’ve thought it over. I don’t need a family.” Kang Xia said without hesitation, “You just have to give me a baby.”</p><p>A baby?</p><p>Tang Xiu blanked out for a moment. He then shook his head and forced a smile.</p><p>At this moment, he suddenly realized something. In his last life, he and she had been together for so many years. But it seemed that she had never conceived his child from the beginning to the end. Even if those super powerful Supremes in the Immortal World couldn’t make their women pregnant, but it had been many years, after all. Could there be no accident, at least once?</p><p>Could it be that… she was using a special means, and she was intentionally not wanted to give him a child?</p><p>That’s right! Maybe her feelings for him were fake. If so, how could she possibly give birth to his child?</p><p>A desolate and dejected light flashed from Tang Xiu’s eyes. He gently raised his chin to gaze at the distant stars in the sky. His eyes were as though looking through the vault of the sky. It was as if his gaze had pierced through innumerable worlds. Arriving at the Immortal World to see a figure that he had once been enamored of.</p><p>Han Qingwu?</p><p>Han Qingwu’s suddenly name emerged inside Tang Xiu’s mind, along with another’s image that was very much like her. Could she be… her?</p><p>Although…</p><p>…although they had so many similarities, but… it may be just a coincidence!</p><p>After all, Han Qingwu was only an ordinary person. They were two separate persons. One was in the Immortal World, while the other was on Earth. Even if she did get reincarnated, or her soul was transmigrated, there was only one-billionth probability she could get reincarnated on Earth.</p><p>Furthermore, although her cultivation was not as high as his back then, there were probably only a few people who were stronger than her in the Immortal World. Who was it that could kill her? Who could force her to have no alternative but to reincarnate or transmigrate her soul?</p><p>Inside his heart, Tang Xiu agonized as the two extremely similar faces churned out inside his mind. As He turned around to look at Kang Xia, the latter was in a daze and looked to be lost in in thought.</p><p>“What are you thinking?”</p><p>Kang Xia came back from her reverie and looked a bit ashamed as she replied, “I was wondering about the child we will have in the future. Would the child be a boy or a girl? If it’s a boy, he must be like you. But if it’s a girl, she certainly must look like me!”</p><p>“Don’t let your mind wander in wild imaginations!” Tang Xiu said with a smile, “Now is not a suitable time for us to have a child. Just wait, we’ll speak about it again later.”</p><p>Kang Xia nodded silently, looking shy.</p><p>“I’m sleepy!” Kang Xia suddenly said.</p><p>Tang Xiu’s eyes landed on her white neck, and then swept over her sensual clavicle. A flame was lit inside his heart as he reached out his hand to hold her fragrant shoulder. Walking her toward the room, he laughed, “Although we’re not in a hurry to have a child, still, the taste of having sex is important to enjoy…”</p><p>\"That’s disgusting…\"</p><p>That night, despite Tang Xiu himself being a cultivator, his accumulated fatigue was not light, while Kang Xia herself was also tired and unwilling to have his fingers touch and move around. At the end of the day, Tang Xiu only hugged her clean body and embraced her to sleep.</p><p>The next morning.</p><p>A ray of sunshine passed through the slit between the window curtain. It fell on Tang Xiu’s sleeping body that was lying on the bed. As his eyelashes fluttered, he woke up from his sleep and discovered that Kang Xia’s figure was not at his side.</p><p>“You’ve woken up, Boss?”</p><p>Kang Xia came inside through the bedroom door. She immediately smiled sweetly when she saw that Tang Xiu had cleaned himself up and had gotten dressed.</p><p>“Mmm, I just woke up.” Tang Xiu said, “How did you get up so early? Are you going to the Wine Tasting Conference?”</p><p>“Yeah, there’s still time.” Kang Xia nodded and smiled, “I wanted to make breakfast for you, but I couldn’t find anything in the fridge. Hence, I went outside to buy it. Ah, that’s right. There’s someone waiting for you outside the villa. He seems to have been waiting for you overnight.”</p><p>Tang Xiu stared blankly for a moment. He looked confused and then said, “Except for you and Chi Nan, I think there is no one else who knows where I live in Shanghai. Besides, Chi Nan herself only knows that I live in this villa complex, but she has never been here.”</p><p>“It’s Li Haoran!” Kang Xia said.</p><p>“What does he want?” Tang Xiu frowned, “Wasn’t the matter already settled last night?”</p><p>“I don’t know either.” Kang Xia shook her head.</p><p>Tang Xiu was silent for a short while, as he then walked toward the outside, “Let’s go! Let’s see what he wants. If he still wants to quarrel, I might as well wipe out his Li Family and be done with it.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
