Even if you don’t want to go through romance again, I will still say it now. In my opinion, there is no woman in this world who can have Master for herself. Even if Master has countless wives, Yan’er will still be content as long as you have me in your heart.”</p><p>She suddenly sat and straightened up her body.</p><p>She faced Tang Xiu, squatted in front of him, raised her small face, and then said, “Master, if you still love that woman, I will help you get her no matter the price. Even if you want to 3,000 beautiful women or 30,000 fairy maiden concubines in your harem, I can help you gather them. However, Yan’er only wants you, Master. Regardless of who Master wants, Yan’er will do everything to help you get them.”</p><p>Tang Xiu’s heart trembled, looking at her in disbelief. Except for forcing out a smile inwardly, he couldn’t utter any words to express what he felt.</p><p>This… Doesn’t! Make! Sense!</p><p>After a very long while, Tang Xiu suddenly recalled the matter with Han Qingwu. His mind suddenly revolved, as he asked, “Yan’er, can you tell Master about something?”</p><p>“What do you want to know, Master?” Gu Yan’er’s color changed as she smiled and said, “As long as Yan’er knows about it, I will tell you everything.”</p><p>Tang Xiu hesitated for a moment, gritted his teeth and then asked, “She… what happened to her?”</p><p>“Xue Qingcheng?” Gu Yan’er’s brows slightly furrowed.</p><p>“Yea!” Tang Xiu nodded.</p><p>“After Master was rumored to have been persecuted by Great Emperor Danqing and Zither Demon Jiu Yao, she was said to have been jointly killed by the other two. I’m not 100% sure whether she’s alive or dead. Even though… I did secretly investigated her for several thousands of years, I’ve yet to find any traces of her. It’s like she disappeared from the Immortal World.”</p><p>A glint flashed in Tang Xiu’s eyes, “You mean… she’s highly likely to have died in Great Emperor Danqing and Zither Demon Jiu Yao’s hands?”</p><p>“The possibility is indeed very likely.” Gu Yan’er nodded and said, “However, since I was mainly looking for Master’s whereabouts, I only investigated her to avenge you. So I’m not too sure.”</p><p>At this time, Tang Xiu finally understood. He knew that the woman who once made him crazy in love had probably already died. And Han Qingwu was, perhaps, her reincarnation.</p><p>Only, the thing that made him a bit doubtful was that, how could she so coincidentally reincarnate on Earth?</p><p>Gu Yan’er’s expressin suddenly moved, saying, “Master, I once deceived Shade Demon Zhu Wushou. I learned something from him about that most beloved disciple of his.”</p><p>“What is it?” Tang Xiu asked.</p><p>“Zhu Wushou’s disciple said that Xue Qingcheng was actually his Senior Sister, and also Shade Demon—Zhu Wushou’s eldest disciple.” Gu Yan’er said.</p><p>\"What did you say?\" Tang Xiu abruptly stood, disbelief burst out from his eyes.</p><p>She is Shade Demon—Zhu Wushou’s disciple?</p><p>Xue Qingcheng actually…</p><p>“Master, I believe him. He shouldn’t have lied to me!” Gu Yan’er said, “But what I don’t understand is why and for what did Shade Demon Zhu Wushou send his eldest disciple to the Vermillion Bird Holy Sect?”</p><p>Tang Xiu didn’t answer her question and instead, took a deep breath. He finally realized that there were indeed many times where Xue Qingcheng looked unusual during her days living together with him.</p><p>Back then he was clueless!</p><p>But now, after thinking about it carefully, he finally realized some things.</p><p>After restraining all his thoughts, Tang Xiu then looked at Gu Yan’er and said, “Yan’er, let’s stop talking about this topic for now. Since you’ve obtained that seed for Master, my cultivation speed will surely get faster. Only after I make myself stronger will I be able to protect the people I care about, and then return to the Immortal World. To look for those who betrayed me and settle the account with them.”</p><p>“Master, Yan’er probably can’t help you.” Gu Yan’er said softly.</p><p>“You’re wrong. You can help me. You’ll be my greatest helper.” Tang Xiu shook his head.</p><p>“But I don’t have much time…” Gu Yan’er said hesitantly.</p><p>“Cut that out!” Tang Xiu angrily retorted, “Who says you’re running out of time? You keep saying that you trust me, don’t you? Do you really think Master is unable to find the Chrono Crystal and the Demonic Revival Grass?”</p><p>Gu Yan’er’s complexion was a bit tarried. She quickly shook her head and said, “Disciple is wrong. I believe Master can achieve it.”</p><p>Looking at her scared look, Tang Xiu turned soft. He reached out his hand to pull her up and gently made her sit next to him. He hugged her as though she was a child and whispered, “Yan’er, it’s my bad. Master shouldn’t have been mad at you. But you have to trust Master. Regardless of how hard and how big the price will be, Master will find those two things and completely remove the Twilight Nightmare from your injury.”</p><p>“All right!” Gu Yan’er rested on Tang Xiu’s chest and gently nodded.</p><p>“Yan’er, your current cultivation level is much more formidable than Master’s. Tell me, what cultivation level have you achieved?” Tang Xiu suddenly asked with a smile.</p><p>“There’s just a step left before I reach the Supreme Stage.” Gu Yan’er smiled lightly.</p><p>“Amazing!” Tang Xiu was surprised and said, “Your cultivation speed is even faster than Master’s in the past!”</p><p>“That’s because Master has laid a solid foundation for me, while I also chanced upon some fortuitous encounters as well.” Feeling happy, Gu Yan’er replied, “However, the strength I can showcase now is perhaps at the level of an ordinary Immortal.”</p><p>“You’re already the strongest here on Earth.” Tang Xiu said with a smile, “You can even destroy this planet should you wish to.”</p><p>“No, I won’t do that!” Gu Yan’er said with a smile, “This place is your hometown, which means that is also Yan’er’s home.”</p><p>“Yan’er, I’m planning to take the exquisite pagoda from this place. I found an island in the Pacific Ocean which is very similar with the Nine Dragons Spitting Pearl Secret Area we once lived in. I already bought that island, and now it’s currently being rebuild. I drew the architectural blueprint myself, and there are a lot of construction workers rebuilding the place. Once the rebuilding has been completed, it will become a land with precious Feng Shui. And that place will become our supreme headquarters in the future.” Tang Xiu said.</p><p>“After Yan’er wakes up, I can plant Rainbow Herbs there?” Gu Yan’er was pleasantly surprised and said, “There are many Rainbow Herbs in Yan’er’s interspatial ring!”</p><p>“Yea, you can!” Tang Xiu said smilingly.</p><p>Gu Yan’er’s smile grew more dazzling. Suddenly, she recalled something and said, “Master, your cultivation level is not that high right now, do you need to eat? Are you hungry? Yan’er wants to eat something, can you accompany me to the restaurant and have a meal with me?”</p><p>“Yan’er, you’re not fit enough to leave the exquisite pagoda for now.” Tang Xiu quickly said, “If you want to eat something, I’ll have it delivered here, and Master will accompany you.”</p><p>Gu Yan’er held Tang Xiu’s arm, shook it, and acted coyly like a little girl, “Master, please! Every time Yan’er wakes up here, I really want to go out to see the outside world. Besides, it won’t take much time. I heard from Old Ji that you found precious medicinal herbs and have concocted Spirit Condensing Pills. Please tell Old Ji to concoct it and give it me. I feel spirited now, and I think I can stay awake for two or three days even if I go out.”</p><p>\"This…\" Tang Xiu hesitated. He didn’t have the heart to reject Yan’er’s request. After a short while, he slowly nodded and said, “All right! I’ll tell Xiaoxue to arrange the meal in the restaurant. We’ll wait until the feast is about ready and then we’ll go out, since staying outside for even a minute would still affect you a bit.”</p><p>“Yes, yes! Thanks, Master!” Gu Yan’er was pleasantly surprised.</p><p>Tang Xiu stood and rushed to the first floor of the exquisite pagoda with his fastest speed. He then looked at the four pair of eyes and said, “Xiaoxue, prepare a meal. Yan’er, I and the others will eat in the restaurant.”</p><p>“But Lord, she is…” Ji Chimei hastily said.</p><p>“Chimei, I understand what’s inside your mind.” Tang Xiu raised his hand to interrupt her and said, “In fact, I also have the same worry. But she wants to go out and see the outside world, so I can only comply with her plea this once! Besides, having a meal won’t take too much time, and it’s better than keeping her here all the time.”</p><p>“I understand your intention, Lord!” Ji Chimei nodded and said, “Xiaoxue, go and arrange it.”</p><p>“Affirmative!”</p><p>Upon hearing that her Master could leave the exquisite pagoda for some time, Gu Xiaoxue immediately looked excited and cried out. Immediately after, her figure turned ethereal and instantly disappeared from the pagoda’s entrance.</p><p>Half an hour later, when Gu Xiaoxue notified that the meal had been prepared, Tang Xiu then brought Gu Yan’er to the first floor of the exquisite pagoda.</p><p>“Greetings, Master.”</p><p>Light and Dark looked excited as they kowtowed, paying respect to Gu Yan’er.</p><p>Gu Yan’er held Tang Xiu’s hand. She lifted her hand gently as a soft force swept the duo and gently lifted them, “Don’t overly stand on ceremony. We haven’t met for a few years, and you have grown up a lot. Anyways, I’ll accompany Master to a meal. You can kowtow to me again!”</p><p>Ji Chimei’s expression flickered, as she then said in a deep voice, “What are you stunned for? Quickly say thanks to Master.”</p><p>Master?</p><p>Light and Dark exchanged glances. They suddenly realized something. Immediately, their faces turned excited and were about to kneel again. But after recalling Gu Yan’er’s words, they held back and respectfully obeyed.</p><p>At this moment, Gu Yan’er didn’t even spare them a glance. There was no one else in her eyes but her Master. While holding Tang Xiu’s arm, she left the exquisite pagoda step by step alongside him and came to the sea surface. After a dozen breaths, a charming smile hung on her face as she and Tang Xiu stood together at the shore.</p><p>“Master, Yan’er establishing the Everlasting Feast Hall turned out not bad a decision at all! At least they found you.”</p><p>“They are indeed very good.” Tang Xiu nodded with a smile, “In fact, you also gave Master a good lesson.”</p><p>“What lesson?” Gu Yan’er curiously asked.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
