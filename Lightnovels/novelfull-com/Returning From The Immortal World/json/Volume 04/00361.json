Under the cover of his spiritual sense, he could observe anything within the radius of a few hundred meters.</p><p>Hence, as long as he spent some time to circle around the villa’s surrounding area, he could find the trails of suspicious people. However, with the great effect binoculars provided nowadays, if those monitoring them were too far away, there may be some fishes that could avoid it.</p><p>“Still, we must search them.” Tang Xiu said with all seriousness, “When we start to clean up the suspicious people following us, I’ll take up the rear.”</p><p>“Being discrete and careful is always good.” Tang Wei nodded and said, “So, how should we do it?”</p><p>“Just pretend that we’re going out to get some fresh air,” Tang Xiu said. “If we find any suspicious people, we have to figure out their identities. If they are enemies, then straightly kill them; if they are not, we’ll go back and organize our retreat.”</p><p>“Alright!” Tang Wei nodded as he touched the pistol in his waist.</p><p>The duo then openly went out of the villa’s front entrance and straightly went toward the villa complex gate. Releasing his spiritual sense, Tang Xiu then observed the situation in the surrounding.</p><p>What Tang Xiu didn’t expect was that his spiritual sense already caught traces of the enemy the moment he came out of the villa. It was from atop the roof of another villa a few hundred meters away from their villa. There were two young men with binoculars quietly monitoring any movements in their villa.</p><p>But Tang Xiu didn’t act rashly. After he and Tang Wei arrived outside the villa complex, the duo pretended to take a stroll, smoking cigarettes and puffing out rings of smoke from time to time.</p><p>“If my memory serves me right, the SUV parked on the left side of the road in front of us should’ve been there for several hours, right? I saw it already parked there when we came back from Changbu Town.” The pale-yellow dim-light of the night couldn’t obstruct Tang Xiu’s sharp eyesight.</p><p>Back when he just returned from Changbu Town, though he noticed that SUV, he just glanced at it and didn’t find anyone in the car. But at present, there were two men inside. One of them was in the back seat and silently smoking by the car window.</p><p>Tang Wei’s vision was not as sharp as Tang Xiu’s. Since the distance between them and the car was about three to four hundred meters away, he couldn’t see anyone in the car. Tang Wei then shook his head and said, “Well, a car parked on the roadside is normal to me! But I didn’t notice that car before, though.”</p><p>“I know it’s normal for a car to park on the roadside. But what if someone is inside?” Said Tang Xiu.</p><p>Witn slight a change in expression, Tang Wei then said, “At such a crucial time like this, I’m afraid that the problem is not as simple as it looks if some people are camping inside cars for several hours.”</p><p>“Let’s have a look!” Said Tang Xiu as he walked toward the car.</p><p>At this time, a young man who was sitting in the driver seat of the SUV was currently looking toward the villa complex gate. At the time Tang Xiu and Tang Wei walked out of the villa complex, the youth had already noticed the duo. What made this rather accidental was that the duo actually came out to take a stroll.</p><p>“Huh?”</p><p>When he realized that the duo was walking toward his position, he immediately turned his head and spoke to the man in the back seat, “Elder Brother Hu, according to the intelligence, from these two guys coming out of the villa complex, one of them is a junior of the Tang Family, Tang Wei.”</p><p>“They’re looking for death!” The man pulled out a pistol as a cold light flashed in his eyes.</p><p>The youth was startled, “Elder Brother Hu, our task is to monitor those Tang Family’s people in Red Maple Villa Complex. If we were to kill them now, wouldn’t the young master punish us?”</p><p>“Don’t worry!” The man sneered, “If we can kill a direct member of the Tang Family, not only young master won’t punish us, he’ll probably give us a reward. You didn’t know, but we got news from Changbu Town before. We’ve lost many people and the young master is extremely furious due to that. If we kill Tang Wei, that will surely make young master satisfied.”</p><p>“Good!” The young man also pulled out a pistol from his waist.</p><p>The distance between both sides was getting closer.</p><p>With his spiritual sense already released, Tang Xiu had already covered the two men inside the car. He could clearly see that both of them were holding pistols with killing intent covering their faces. At this instant, he had determined the identity of these two men. They were either from the Yao or the Sun Families.</p><p>Likewise, they were enemies.</p><p>“Elder Brother Wei, be careful. They should have guns.” Tang Xiu whispered.</p><p>“Rest assured. They won’t shoot us easily since they are currently monitoring us.” Said Tang Wei.</p><p>Tang Xiu sighed inwardly. From their actions, how is it that they wouldn’t shoot? They perhaps wished that they could shoot them right now, no?”</p><p>\"Give me your gun.\" Tang Xiu’s pace came to a halt as he stopped before Tang Wei and spoke.</p><p>Tang Wei hesitated for a moment before he took out his pistol and handed it over to Tang Xiu.</p><p>After receiving the pistol, Tang Xiu instantly stuffed it into his pocket and then moved to the sideway. He then slowly walked toward the other side. As the distance was getting closer and was only about thirty meters away from them, Tang Xiu suddenly stopped and moved lightning fast. The instant he took out the pistol, he released the gun’s safety lock and aimed the muzzle toward the two men in the SUV.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>The sounds of gunshot sounded. The bullets hit the windscreen, hitting the youth’s head in the driver’s seat and the other one hit the heart of the man in the back seat. Tang Xiu never had any firearms training, yet his marksmanship was extremely accurate. In his eyes, shooting a gun was akin to using a concealed weapon; he could easily do it.</p><p>Tang Wei’s complexion changed. He could see that the man in the driver’s seat was hit. He quickly dashed toward Tang Xiu and rapidly said, “Brother, why did you shoot so anxiously?”</p><p>Patting his shoulder, Tang Xiu’s action warmed his heart. He then smilingly said, “Let’s go back!”</p><p>Puzzled, Tang Wei pointed at the SUV and said, “Then, their…”</p><p>“Some people will come to gather their dead bodies. We should circle around the villa complex now. If we don’t find any other enemies, then we’ll clean up those two enemies inside the villa complex and then evacuate immediately.” Tang Xiu let out a pale smile and replied.</p><p>“There are two enemies inside the villa complex?”</p><p>Tang Wei was stupefied, his expression when looking at Tang Xiu getting more and more strange. He had been with Tang Xiu all along and also quietly observed all the way. Yet, how could he not find any enemies at all?</p><p>After they returned to the villa complex ten minutes later, Tang Xiu stopped in a secluded corner and said, “Wait for me here. I’ll be back fast.”</p><p>Tang Wei opened his mouth, wanting to follow Tang Xiu. But he didn’t know the situation and was afraid he would implicate Tang Xiu. Eventually, he could only nod silently.</p><p>A short while after, Tang Xiu returned to Tang Wei’s side and smilingly said, “I’ve taken care of those two guys. Let’s go and tell everyone to evacuate immediately!”</p><p>Tang Wei silently nodded.</p><p>Such a gap! Ever since Tang Xiu came with him to Guangyang, from each issue handled by Tang Xiu, he realized that there was a big gap between the two of them.</p><p>Quickly after, more than a dozen vehicles rapidly left Red Maple Villa Complex like the wind. After converging with Xue Jie and the others outside the villa complex, they then headed toward Hongpo District’s direction.</p><p>However, the car rode by Tang Xiu stopped on the roadside after driving for a dozen kilometers. He then released his spiritual sense and quietly observed the following vehicles. After he stalled for several minutes and found no vehicles following them, only then did he accelerate and catch up with the others.</p><p>Twenty minutes later.</p><p>At a place some distance away from Hongpo District, the cars parked on the roadside. Except for those driving, everyone got off one after another to change directions, taking buses or taxis, and then rushed toward the factory in Hongpo District.</p><p>Nowadays, electronic eyes were present on the road everywhere. With the abilities possessed by the Yao and Sun Families, it was very easy to find their cars’ whereabouts from the Transportation Department. Hence, it was necessary for them to abandon the cars halfway and then take other means of transportation.</p><p>2 AM.</p><p>Inside the worker living quarters in the rented factory, the lights in a dozen rooms had been lit. A few hours ago, Guo Sen had personally led some people to buy a large amount of bedding, pots, pans, and other articles of daily use. Accordingly, they joined up with Tang Xiu and the others to clean up the place.</p><p>“Young Master Xiu, we’re done.”</p><p>Li Xiaojie, together with several strong men, reported to Tang Xiu who was inside a smoke-filled conference room.</p><p>Nodding to him in response, Tang Xiu then pointed to the chairs, motioning them to sit down. He then slowly asked, “How did you deal with the cars?”</p><p>“We abandoned them near Guan City’s traffic police squad.” Said Li Xiaojie.</p><p>A touch of a smile appeared on the corner of Tang Xiu’s mouth as he nodded and said, “Well done! This time we’ll take the initiative to launch a strike. All of you take a good rest today, and at most at noon tomorrow, I’ll devise the operation plan.”</p><p>“Understood!”</p><p>Inside the conference room, Xue Jie, Tang Wei, and Li Xiaojie nodded in unison.</p><p>“Auntie Xue, I’m afraid you’ll have to work hard. I need to know the details about the businesses belonging to the Yao and the Sun Families in Guangyang. That will include their company’s address and the list of their staffs. I want it done before 2 PM tomorrow.” Said Tang Xiu.</p><p>Xue Jie nodded, “I’m good in this regard. Leave it to me!”</p><p>Tang Xiu nodded and then looked at Tang Wei, “You’ll in charge of this place. Immediately capture any suspicious person who approaches the factory. Should they resist, don’t hesitate to shoot them.”</p><p>“Copy that!” Tang Wei nodded.</p><p>Then, Tang Xiu looked to Li Xiaojie, “You’ll go with me to Fukang tomorrow. I must personally visit the Bai Family’s head.”</p><p>“Roger that!” Said Li Xiaojie immediately.</p><p>After Tang Xiu’s arrangements, the trio left the conference room.</p><p>In the corridor outside the conference room, Hei Long was smoking while leaning on the wall. He now fully realized that what Tang Xiu told him before was true. Killing him was easy as pinching an ant if Tang Xiu wished it.</p><p>He had secretly observed. Those forty to fifty strong men were professionals. Furthermore, he could tell that they were once soldiers.</p><p>However, worries still lingered inside his heart. From Tang Xiu and these people’s actions, he could tell that Tang Xiu was going to make a great move and highly like start a war with someone else. Though he couldn’t guess who the other party was; however, they were definitely very powerful given that they could drive the Tang Family into a critical situation.</p><p>Additionally, till now he was still clueless as to what Tang Xiu picked him for. What would be his role?</p><p>“Hei Long, Tang Xiu wants you to come inside.”</p><p>As Xue Jie came out of the conference room, her eyes fell on Hei Long.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
