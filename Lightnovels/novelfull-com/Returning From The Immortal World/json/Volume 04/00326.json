Then I don’t have to call the cops,” said Tang Xiu, “But if they dare to trouble us again, I’ll clean them up myself. Now, give us another box and serve a table with food and wine. Let them pay for it.”</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>The middle-aged woman never imagined that Tang Xiu would be so easy to talk to, as she immediately cast him a grateful expression. One must know that, were this incident to be reported to the police, it would certainly impact their restaurant’s reputation. On one hand she said she would call the police and tried to compensate Tang Xiu and his friends. While on the other hand, she had also intended to invite Tang Xiu have a private talk, to see whether she could reduce and melt this big problem into a minor matter.</p><p>A moment after, the badly beaten middle-aged man left with his underlings, whereas Tang Xiu and the others moved to another bright and spacious box. After taking a seat, Zhao Liang raised his thumb and exclaimed with an excited expression, “Eldest Brother Tang, you’re just so great! I was preoccupied with how to ward off those guys, but without me realizing it, you had unknowingly knocked them down.”</p><p>Also wearing an excited look on his face, Yue Kai spoke while rubbing his arm that got hit by a steel pipe, “True that! I was preparing to a desperate fight and got preoccupied with the other people, so I couldn’t see clearly what you were doing. Eldest Brother Tang, how did you do that? You can’t be a martial arts expert like those in wuxia novels, can you?”</p><p>“Nope. I’m not martial arts expert,” shaking his head, Tang Xiu said, “I’m just practicing some flowery boxing; I’m not an opponent for true experts. But, beating some gangsters isn’t a problem for me. They wanted to beat us, hence we can use everything we have for self-defense, like smashing plates at them. So, naturally, we can beat them with a clear conscience.”</p><p>Hu Qingsong’s face flickered. He patted Tang Xiu’s shoulder and said, “Since they call you the Eldest, I’ll call you that too! I won’t say thanks for this great favor. But since you, the eldest, has stood up for me today, I, Hu Qingsong, will engrave this favor in my mind. If you have some problems in the future, whatever it is, just look for me. I will do my best to help out.”</p><p>“It’s just a trivial thing. Never mind it,” laughed Tang Xiu.</p><p>“No,” Hu Qingsong shook his head and said, “Were it not because of you, perhaps I would have ended up badly today. It was my carelessness. I never thought that after I beat them, they would secretly follow me here. Come on, I won’t say thanks. Though the food have yet to come, let’s get these two bottles of wine first. Let me thank you with a toast.”</p><p>\"Come!\"</p><p>\"Cheers!\"</p><p>Yue Kai and Zhao Liang also got up.</p><p>The unexpected fight, sharing hardship in the crisis, it made the relationship between the four much closer. Furthermore, for youngsters hanging out together, random topics were endless.</p><p>After the meal, the four young men left the restaurant with arms around each other’s shoulders after getting a little drunk.</p><p>Quite a drinker himself, Hu Qingsong had drunk a bottle of booze by himself, yet he was more sober than Yue Kai and Zhao Liang. Looking at the both of them swaying, Hu Qingsong looked at Tang Xiu and asked, “Eldest Brother Tang, where are we going now?”</p><p>“Let’s go back to campus and send them directly to the dormitory to sleep,” said Tang Xiu.</p><p>“That’s the only option left,” Hu Qingsong nodded and said, “I didn’t expect Yue Kai to have such a good liquor capacity, though. Yet, Zhao Liang didn’t even drink half a bottle and still turned out like this.”</p><p>“People say that northeasterners can drink well. I did experience it today,” chuckled Tang Xiu.</p><p>“Eldest Brother Tang, don’t flatter me. Though I can drink more than a bottle of booze and still stand up, I’m far worse compared to you. I paid attention when we were drinking; you drank more than me, yet it did nothing to you. I suspect that you won’t get drunk even if you drink one more bottle.”</p><p>Tang Xiu couldn’t help laughing, saying, “If I really gulped down another bottle, I’m afraid that you won’t have to support only two people, but three.”</p><p>“If we get another idle day again, let’s have a battle,” laughed Hu Qingsong.</p><p>Tang Xiu shook his head and grabbed the car key from Yue Kai’s pocket. After opening the door and forcefully stuffing the two young men into the back seat, he then sat in the front seat and said with a smile, “Hey, what are you dazing for? Get on board!”</p><p>“Is this your car?” asked Hu Qingsong aloud as he sat on the copilot seat with astonishment.</p><p>“Nope, it’s Yue Kai’s!” said Tang Xiu, “He’s a second generation nouveau-riche.”</p><p>“It seems like these brothers of ours can go flirting with chicks everywhere smoothly. It’s a BMW, dude! Holy cow, a student riding on BMW… tsk, tsk!”</p><p>Tang Xiu smiled as he started the car and quickly left.</p><p>The duo had been sent back to the dormitory. Tang Xiu’s last dorm mate had yet to come, however, the other three students from the opposite dorm had all arrived. Tang Xiu and the three students greeted each other, and after a short introduction, they returned to their dormitory.</p><p>“Brother Tang, do you have any plans this afternoon?” asked Hu Qingsong curiously.</p><p>“I do. I’ll go out and stroll around. It’s my first time in Shanghai, so I’m gonna take in the view. There won’t be much time to go out and stroll around when the new term begins,” said Tang Xiu with a smile.</p><p>“Eldest Brother Tang, I heard you’re the CET science subject’s top scorer in Shuangqing Province. The top student level protagonist, eh. Seems like you’re ready to take the military drill subject ahead of time and then transfer to Shanghai all the way through. I presume you’ll be staying on campus afterward?”</p><p>“It should be, if there’s no accident,” said Tang Xiu.</p><p>“Then I’ll accompany you strolling around! I got nothing to do in the afternoon anyway,” said Hu Qingsong.</p><p>After a moment’s silence, Tang Xiu slowly said, “Yue Kai said before that he and Zhao Liang would gather in their dormitory this evening. I myself will be doing something at that time, so I’m afraid I can’t participate. If you go with me, I’m afraid you won’t have the time to attend the party.”</p><p>Hu Qingsong hesitated for a moment and then said, “I won’t attend it then. Anyhow, it’s still early and there is much time left. It’s alright to drink together all day. Let’s stroll outside first and get some fresh air. Eldest Brother Tang, you know what? Since I boarded the train to Shanghai, I felt like I was flying high in the sky, like a fish swimming in the ocean; no longer feeling controlled by my old man.”</p><p>Tang Xiu looked at him and calmly said, “Having someone always looking after you is better than having nobody who is always concerned and asks you to strive to better yourself. Be content, buddy!”</p><p>Hu Qingsong stared blankly for a moment as he stared at Tang Xiu with a strange expression. He suddenly pointed at Yue Kai’s car key and asked, “Won’t we take the car?”</p><p>“No,” Tang Xiu shook his head and said, “It’s Yue Kai’s car. He might go out when he wakes up in the afternoon, and will probably need it when he goes out in the evening. Let’s take a cab.”</p><p>“OK!” Hu Qingsong nodded.</p><p>Tang Xiu and Hu Qingsong strolled around for the whole afternoon. The duo went to the Bund, visited Huangpu River, and climbed up the Oriental Pearl Tower. They drank coffee in Nanjing Road and then went to the City God Temple to burn incense, and then visited the Yu Garden and the Shanghai Science and Technology Museum.</p><p>As evening arrived, Tang Xiu received a call from Han Qingwu.</p><p>“Where are you, Tang Xiu?” Han Qingwu’s voice came out of the phone, sounding particularly joyful.</p><p>“I’m with a classmate, as well as dorm mate, at the entrance of the Science and Technology Museum! We have been strolling around Shanghai and lost track of the time,” said Tang Xiu with a smile.</p><p>“Science and Technology Museum? I know the place. Are you gonna wait for me there? Or shall we meet at another place for our dinner tonight?”</p><p>“Go to Shanghai’s Everlasting Feast Hall! We’ll take a cab to catch up with you.”</p><p>\"Alright!\" replied Han Qingwu.</p><p>After putting away his mobile, Tang Xiu spoke to Hu Qingsong, “ Teacher Han and I have a dinner tonight. I have already picked the place, so let’s go there now!”</p><p>“Who’s Teacher Han?” asked Hu Qingsong, confused.</p><p>“It’s our class’ teacher in charge, Han Qingwu.”</p><p>Hu Qingsong was stunned. He looked at Tang Xiu with disbelief, exclaiming, “The class’ teacher in charge, Han Qingwu, is having dinner with us? You… are you kidding me?”</p><p>“What’s there to joke about? It’s just dinner, what’s the fuss for?” said Tang Xiu with a smile.</p><p>“What? This is not worth the fuss? It’s only the first day, yet you acted so fast! And your target is unexpectedly our Teacher Han? Man, she’s a hella beauty; even my eyes were nearly unable to look straight the first time I saw her,” said Hu Qingsong.</p><p>Tang Xiu couldn’t help laughing, “Han Qingwu was actually my high school class’ teacher in charge. But I never imagined that she would suddenly transfer to Shanghai University; even also becoming our class’s teacher in charge. In any case, we’re just having dinner.”</p><p>With an inconceivable expression, Hu Qingsong said, “I finally figured out why Yue Kai and Zhao Liang insisted to call you Eldest Brother Tang. It turns out that your flirting skill is so marvelous. Man, I never thought that even such a stunning beauty such as Teacher Han would have her heart captured by you. What a marvel. O, Hail Eldest Brother Tang!”</p><p>“Get lost!” Tang Xiu cursed.</p><p>At Shanghai’s Everlasting Feast Hall.</p><p>In front of the five-storied octagonal restaurant was a large, well-maintained parking lot. There were four big men guarding the entrance of the Everlasting Feast Hall. Before the four big men, a welcoming lady in cheongsam warmly greeted each arriving guest.</p><p>Inside the restaurant.</p><p>The first floor had a novel and interesting interior, with each area partitioned by screens and carved wood, along with a dining table inside each partition. On both sides were waterspouts with sprinkled water being illuminated with seven colored lights. A beautiful scene that was a sight to behold.</p><p>Shanghai’s Everlasting Feast Hall was under Tian Li’s management. However, since she needed to shuttle back and forth between Jingmen Island, Hong Kong, Shanghai and Beijing, a deputy manager was appointed to manage the Shanghai and Beijing branches on her behalf. The deputy manager was also a core member of the Everlasting Feast Hall -- Chi Nan.</p><p>At present, Chi Nan had just come back from the outside and was watching the bustling scene in the restaurant while feeling rather helpless inside. She envied those companions of hers who stayed in Jingmen Island, since they were able to stay and cultivate with ease, as well as had occasional chance to carry out missions abroad.</p><p>“Chief Chi, the VIP lounge on the fourth floor has been opened; Miao Wentang from Haiqing came with a few of his friends. I have also sent the order to deliver all the good dishes and fine wines to him,” said the hall manager as he greeted respectfully.</p><p>VIP? Miao Wentang?</p><p>Chi Nan was silent for a moment as she nodded and said, “I see. Go busy yourself! I’ll be there to have a toast with him shortly.”</p><p>“Alright!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
