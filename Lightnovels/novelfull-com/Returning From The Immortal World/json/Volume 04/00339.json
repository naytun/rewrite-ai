Hence, he chose to act cool-headedly instead of recklessly getting himself involved.</p><p>Furthermore, the Tangs and the Yaos were not just clans of business. Most importantly, both families had ties in the political field. With high-level political contests coming into the field, it would lead to all sorts of trouble once he intervened.</p><p>Just like using the best steel to make the knife’s edge, he was indeed the best resource at the moment! But the conflict between the Tangs and the Yaos was only at the initial stage, far from the life and death stage. Unless the Tang family was about to suffer massive losses, which could seriously hamper the Tang Family, only then would he act without reserve.</p><p>However, he actually still had time to visit the Huang family’s head since the Huang family head and the Everlasting Feast Hall had a deep relationship.</p><p>After analyzing the situation, he decided to contact the Huang family head tomorrow. He then put away all his thoughts to the back of his mind and he went back to his bed, sitting cross-legged and began cultivating.</p><p>At present, his cultivation had drastically progressed and reached the peak of the Flesh Strengthening Stage. There was only a step left before he made the breakthrough to the Bone Transformation Stage. He fortunately didn’t get stuck in the Flesh Strengthening Stage for a long time due to his fortuitous encounter in Nine Dragons Island.</p><p>Sitting cross-legged in cultivation, layer upon layer of star force from the stars in the sky surged in as though tide waves toward Tang Xiu. His star force’s absorption speed now was several times faster compared with when he was in the Skin Strengthening Stage. Unfortunately, the heaven and earth Spiritual Qi in Shanghai was extremely scarce, causing his cultivation speed to be far worse than when he was cultivating in Nine Dragons Island.</p><p>The Heavenly Art of Cosmic Genesis was divided into three realms. The first: Stars Tyrannical Body Realm, was divided into nine stages, which were the Vitality Tempering, the Skin Strengthening, the Bone Transformation, the Meridian Transformation, the Marrow Transformation, the Viscera Transformation, the Blood and Qi Circulation, and the Nine Cores Phase Forming.</p><p>By now, he was at the peak of the Flesh Strengthening Stage. Though it couldn’t be compared with the Golden Core Stage, it didn’t have much difference. He had the confidence to have comparable strength to a initial level Golden Core Stage expert once he broke through to the Bone Transformation Stage.</p><p>The more his cultivation advanced, the more secret arts he could use. However, in today’s modern society, he didn’t have much opportunity to use them.</p><p>It seems I need to cultivate in Nine Dragons Island if I want to increase my strength quickly.</p><p>After cultivating for four hours, Tang Xiu slowly opened his eyes, his handsome face showing a wry smile. The result of his four hours of cultivation were only comparable with half an hour of practice in Nine Dragons Island.</p><p>At 8:00 AM.</p><p>Woken up from his sleep, Tang Xiu washed his face and rinsed his mouth. After refreshing himself, he went downstairs and then realized that there was nobody in this villa aside from himself. There was no housemaid here to help him make breakfast unlike in South Gate Town.</p><p>Should I hire a domestic worker?</p><p>Tang Xiu hesitated for a moment. He then decided to take the time to find a housekeeping service company and choose a good-natured and diligent domestic worker.</p><p>“I gotta go to the campus and buy some food on the way!”</p><p>Tang shook his head and forced out a wry smile. After leaving the villa complex, he bought some food in a shop near the business district and didn’t take a cab as he ate while walking.</p><p>Though the student’s military training would begin on the seventh of this month, Tang Xiu himself didn’t want to attend it. The university’s military training subject was simply a child’s play for him. Attending it would only be an utter nuisance. Hence, he had long decided to find Le Baiyi after going to the classroom today. Since the man was the Vice Dean of the Department of History at Shanghai University, he should have the ability to help him withdrawal from the military training subject.</p><p>The B Building’s classroom, on the fourth floor.</p><p>As Tang Xiu arrived at the classroom, there were twenty to thirty people scattered around the classroom. Yue Kai, Hu Qingsong, Zhao Liang and two other students who had a party yesterday were gathered together as they laughed and chatted.</p><p>“Eldest Brother Tang!”</p><p>Seeing Tang Xiu’s arrival, Hu Qingsong’s eyes immediately turned bright as he waved and shouted. With his loud voice, the other twenty to thirty students in the classroom all looked at Tang Xiu almost in an instant.</p><p>They heard about Tang Xiu’s name when they came to the campus. Not only they learned that Tang Xiu was the top scorer of the CET’s science subject in Shuangqing province, they also learned that Tang Xiu’s former class’ teacher in charge was also their current class’ teacher in charge.</p><p>Smiling at all of his classmates, Tang Xiu then strode toward Hu Qingsong’s side and said with a smile, “Doesn’t it say that the class begins at 9:30? Why are you here so early?”</p><p>“What else but to meet and greet?! It’s the first day where all classmates meet each other, dude. Although nearly half of our classmates have yet to arrive, but we still wanna know whether we have striking belles in our class. But heck, it’s really a pity…” said Yue Kai.</p><p>Tang Xiu couldn’t help laughing. When he entered the classroom, he saw that their class only had six girls, and their appearances were very ordinary.</p><p>“We are here to study, mate. If you wanna chase after girls, you’d better go to the bar outside the campus. But seeing your circumstance, it should be easy for you to pick up some paid hot chicks who fool around in nightclubs,” said Tang Xiu with a smile.</p><p>“Nah, I’m not interested in the king that casually invite men to their rooms.” Yue Kai waved his hand and said, “Don’t you think enjoying that kind of chick is kinda like scavenging junk?”</p><p>Scavenging junk?</p><p>Everyone burst into laughter.</p><p>Tang Xiu rolled his eyes. Feeling amused yet feeling ridiculous, he said, “You think you’re picking up junk, but others may find it cheaper, no? You, ah… a man who has eaten to the full has no idea how hungry starving men could be. If you don’t believe me, ask Hu Qingsong. If it was him, would he think that it was only scavenging junk?”</p><p>“Nope. I absolutely won’t feel like that,” replied Hu Qingsong immediately, “I will feel that I’m a very handsome and charming man. I would’ve been very glad if those hot chicks drag me to their rooms.”</p><p>“Pfft…” Rolling his eyes, Yue Kai groaned, “If you really wanna have these paper chicks, let’s go to a few nightclubs later. I’ll help you hook up with some of them. Anyhow, Eldest Brother Tang, will you teach us your flirting skill?”</p><p>“I really know nothing about flirting with girls,” Tang Xiu shook his head and said, “If you really want to learn, I’ll buy some love secret manuals to read later. After I learn some flirting skills from them, then I’ll immediately teach you. Of course, if you find it too troublesome, I’ll buy it for you.”</p><p>“Are you kidding me, dude?” said Yue Kai resentfully, “If you really don’t have real skills to flirt with chicks, how can Teacher Han possibly do everything she could to teach in Shanghai University only to chase you? Besides, I dare say that she must have used her network to enter our Department of History and become our class’ teacher in charge.”</p><p>Tang Xiu flung his head to the side. Since explaining wouldn’t clear the idea, why would he bother to explain? It was Han Qingwu’s life, whereas he himself also his own. Their relationship was only between a teacher and student, how would such a relationship appear in the middle, to begin with?</p><p>Although her looks was very much like his wife in the Immortal World, yet it was but only appearances. He didn’t believe that Han Qingwu and that woman had the slightest relationship whatsoever.</p><p>Hu Qingsong also picked up the topic as he said deceitfully, “Eldest Brother Tang, you may not believe me, but when I came back with Teacher Han last night, I realized a very peculiar situation.”</p><p>Staring blankly at the comment, Tang Xiu was confused, “What situation?”</p><p>“When we came back last night, Teacher Han’s eyes were flashing and she always had a bright smile on her pretty face every time your name was brought up. I dare say that Teacher Han really has a crush on you. Even if you two are not together now, but as long as you’re bold enough to confess your love, you can definitely hug her in your arms.”</p><p>“Screw off!” Tang Xiu snapped and cursed in reply.</p><p>“Tsk, tsk. Did you hear it? Did you hear what Qingsong said, Eldest Brother Tang?” Yue Kai clicked his tongue as he sighed, “Teacher Han has a crush on you. You won’t be able to pretend regardless of how much you try. At least not in front of us. You don’t know how many people want to hold the likes of such a strikingly beautiful women such as Teacher Han in their arms!”</p><p>\"...\"</p><p>Tang Xiu suddenly realized that these guys were regarding him as the reincarnation of a fucking stud horse. There was nothing but lust, passion, and love in their brains! Didn’t they know that there was something outside those things, like the many feelings between two persons?</p><p>Speak of the devil and he doth appear…</p><p>When they were talking about Han Qingwu, the beautiful figure of the person herself appeared outside the classroom. Her elegant hair floated in the breeze as she clapped her hands, causing everyone’s eyes to fall on her in an instant.</p><p>In an attractive one-piece dress that served as a perfect foil for her delicate and tender figure, coupled with her striking looks, she was simply like a goddess in the mind of numerous male students.</p><p>Gently caressing her long hair in front of her forehead, Han Qingwu smiled and said, “Our class has 48 students altogether. From the total, 28 have come, whereas the other 20 have yet to arrive. However, I believe that the others will come soon on this second day of registration. Now, for the students who have arrived, go to the podium and introduce yourselves respectively!”</p><p>\"I'll go first!\"</p><p>Yue Kai raised his hand and then strode to the podium.</p><p>As bold and open as he was, he smiled and swept his gaze over all the students. He cleared his throat and said, “Hi classmates, my name is Yue Kai. I’m a native of Shanghai, age 21 and have never been married until this year… and no girlfriend either. So if any of you have any beautiful women in your hometown, or beautiful friends or relatives, you gotta spontaneously introduce them to me. Anyways, I have a wide range of hobbies. I love playing funny games, so all of you can find me later to play often…”</p><p>“Hahaha…”</p><p>Amidst the laughter, Yue Kai carried through his self-introduction. His speech was very amusing and won favorable impression from the vast majority of the classmates.</p><p>Nearby, Han Qingwu was at a loss whether she had to cry or laugh. She gently raised her hand and laughed, saying, “Why do I feel like you’re not in University to study but to find a blind date? You don’t think our Shanghai University is a marriage agency, do you?”</p><p>“Ugh, how did you know, Teacher Han?”</p><p>Yue Kai deliberately showed a shocked expression.</p><p>\"Hahaha...\"</p><p>The students underneath the podium laughed yet again.</p><p>However, Tang Xiu didn’t laugh. He had hardly paid any attention to Han Qingwu before. But today, unbeknownst to him, or maybe because of what Yue Kai and Hu Qingsong said left something inside his heart, he paid some more attention to Han Qingwu today.</p><p>But precisely because of paying more attention to her, he caught the sight of Han Qingwu cascading her fingers and glimpsed at her fingers’ flicking motion. The sight made Tang Xiu’s complexion immediately change.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
