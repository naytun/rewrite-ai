Since you don’t wanna say, I won’t ask.” Tang Yunde smiled lightly and said, “Give me some time. I’ll make you a genuine second-generation nouveau riche later.”</p><p>Tang Xiu shook his head, “I’m afraid there’s no hope for you to make me a second generation nouveau riche in this lifetime.”</p><p>“Are you looking down on me?” Tang Yunde stared at him.</p><p>“It’s not that I’m looking down on you.” Tang Xiu said with a smile, “But how much money do you think you can make annually? Do you want me to tell you how much net profit I got after selling only two batches of Gods Nectar?”</p><p>“How much?”</p><p>Tang Yunde really didn’t know. He only learned that Gods Nectar was very hot now. Kang Xia even sent over ten boxes personally. He tasted it, and the flavor truly was the best.</p><p>Smiling lightly, Tang Xiu stretched out four fingers and said, “Nearly four billion. And like I said, it’s just the net profit.”</p><p>Hiss…</p><p>Tang Yunde abruptly stood, but his weak leg made him sat back on the sofa. As shock covered his thin face, he looked at Tang Xiu in disbelief and then called out, “You’re saying that the Gods Nectar that you’ve just marketed has earned you four billion? Are you not joking with me?”</p><p>“If Kang Xia didn’t lie to me, then I’m not joking with you, Dad.” Tang Xiu smiled lightly and said, “Kang Xia told me when we were on the way here, Mom was also there. Additionally, the other products of my Magnificent Tang Corp, the cosmetic products, have also hit the market, and Kang Xia told me that the volume sales of the two cosmetic products are now increasing every day. Within a short period of time, the net profit earned by the Magnificent Tang Corp has approached 100 million.”</p><p>Cough, cough…</p><p>Tang Yunde choked a few times.</p><p>He knew his son’s Magnificent Tang Corp had hit well. Although the earlier development was smooth after Gods Nectar hit the market, and due to its great flavor he had imagined that its sales would be great. However, he hadn’t expected that the Gods Nectar’s profit would be that big. Even the cosmetic products seemed to have a great potential as well.</p><p>As for himself...</p><p>Even if he started his own endeavor and worked hard, he wouldn’t be able to catch up with his son’s Magnificent Tang Corp, no?</p><p>Tang Yunde’s shocked heart slowly eased, replaced by helplessness. He shook his head and forced a smile, “It is said that now is the era of relying on one’s father’s wealth and prestige to get ahead. But it looks like that it’s the reverse in our family, that is, the son is the one managing the family. I can’t make you a second generation nouveau riche. Then, that makes you a third generation as well as a first generation nouveau riche, I think.”</p><p>A smile outlined on the corner of Tang Xiu’s mouth, “Dad, you know your son is strong! Anyhow, if you have nothing else, I’ll go first. Though I gave the company matters to Kang Xia to handle, I still have to abreast of matters, though.”</p><p>“Yea, even if Kang Xia is reliable and trustworthy, but after all, she’s an outsider, unless you take her…” Tang Yunde nodded.</p><p>Tang Xiu waved his hand and said, “Stop! Let’s talk about this topic later.”</p><p>Having said that, Tang Xiu strode out of the door. However, he didn’t go to the first floor directly, instead, he went to the study room. After he saw the things inside the room, his expression immediately turned satisfied. His parents evidently knew that he had arranged Mu Qingping’s matters beforehand, thus they didn’t let anyone casually move anything inside his study room. Therefore, the decorations inside were still the same as before.</p><p>“Break…”</p><p>Tang Xiu took a few minutes to dismantle several small arrays he had set up before. He then collected all the valuables into his interspatial ring.</p><p>Afterward, he walked downstairs.</p><p>In the kitchen, he saw his mother and Kang Xia there, with the two housemaids helping them. Tang Xiu smiled and then saw the bored Su Quan sitting on the living room’s sofa, watching all sorts of TV programs.</p><p>“Quan, how is Brother Ben now?” Tang Xiu sat beside him and asked with a smile.</p><p>“He’s still the same. Uprightly honest, insensible to accommodate to circumstances, and still ensuring the security in the winery! But I heard the winery’s director admires him. He said his character is trustworthy and reliable, so he’s been promoted to become the vice-captain of the security team.”</p><p>“We all know perfectly well about Brother Ben’s character.” Tang Xiu said with a smile, “However, it’s a good thing, though. I’ll send him to train after a while. Let alone becoming the security teams’ vice-captain for the winery, it wouldn’t even be a problem for him to become the Magnificent Tang Corps’ security chief captain in the future.”</p><p>“Are you going to set up a security team?” Su Quan was surprised.</p><p>“I do have this plan. After all, the enterprise has a lot of assets, so we need people to protect ourselves.” Tang Xiu said with a smile.</p><p>“That’s true. A pity that I’m not suitable for security given my character. I would have suffocated otherwise.” Su Quan nodded.</p><p>“Your disposition is suited to managing. You’re suitable to do business and management.” Tang Xiu said with a smile, “However, after you got the ability, you mustn’t resign from the Magnificent Tang Corp and self-employ yourself!”</p><p>Su Quan retracted his smile. He shook his head and said, “Xiu, we brothers grew up together. You brought me to Star City and changed my destiny. I’m not one the type without conscience. Besides, my present income is pretty good. So long as my performance gets better, I trust my income will get higher as well. I’m not that silly to let go of a well-paid occupation and run out to strive for myself!”</p><p>Tang Xiu smiled. Just as he was about to speak, his eyes flickered when he saw passing on the TV’s screen. Suddenly, the smile on his face froze and, as if lightning had suddenly struck his heart, he suddenly jumped. In a flash, he dashed to the TV’s front and his eyes stared fixedly at the advertisement on it.</p><p>“Buried diamond, classical centuries of age and reincarnation, to find and give birth to perfect crystallization of romance. It’s something worth for you all to have. Come, see us on October 1st in Shanghai Glory Auction. We look forward to your visit.”</p><p>On the TV screen, a glittering crystal diamond was emitting a fantastic, gorgeous light. Nine emerald leaves were composed around the diamond, forming a unique patterned diamond ring.</p><p>“Xiu, what happened?”</p><p>Looking at Tang Xiu’s unusual behavior, Su Quan asked curiously.</p><p>An excited look flashed in Tang Xiu’s eyes as he clenched his fist tightly. At this time, his breathing turned rapid, and his heart beat got faster than normal.</p><p>He only felt a familiar feeling when he first saw the diamond ring. But in a flash after, he suddenly realized that the ring design pattern of nine emerald leaves was akin to a plant… the Demonic Revival Grass.</p><p>That’s right! This pattern is entirely tailored according to the Demonic Revival Grass. I have to find the person who crafted this diamond ring. He must have news of the Demonic Revival Grass.</p><p>Tang Xiu suddenly turned around to look at Su Quan and asked, “What was the auction’s name said on TV just now?”</p><p>“Shanghai Glory Auction!” Su Quan said.</p><p>Tang Xiu immediately rushed to the kitchen and loudly said, “Mom, I have an urgent matter and must return to Shanghai, so I won’t have time to eat the meal! Kang Xia, after I’ve handled this important matter, I’ll come back and give the celebration feast. However, you can organize the merit celebration first before I come back.”</p><p>While holding a scoop in her hand, Su Lingyun asked with a puzzled expression, “Xiu’er, didn’t we just come back from Shanghai? What do you have to do there?”</p><p>“There’s a very important thing I must deal with promptly.” Tang Xiu said seriously.</p><p>“Son, you still have to eat even if it’s important!” Su Lingyun said.</p><p>“There’s no time, Mom! I’ll going now!” Tang Xiu said as he waved his hand and walked away.</p><p>After hesitating for a moment, Kang Xia hurriedly chased after him. By the time she caught up, Tang Xiu was already sitting in the car he left parked in Star City, the Land Rover SUV.</p><p>“Boss, you’ll be going to Shanghai, but when will you come back approximately? If you don’t participate in the celebration, even if our Magnificent Tang Corp holds the feast, it won’t be joyous. Many high-level executives of our company want to see you!” Kang Xia stood outside the window and said.</p><p>Tang Xiu was silent for a moment. He then shook his head and said, “I don’t know how long it’ll take, but I’ll return as fast as possible! Let’s keep in touch.”</p><p>“All right!”</p><p>With a tinge of disappointment, Kang Xia silently nodded.</p><p>As the car rushed out of South Gate Town, it then rushed toward the Airport. Tang Xiu then called the private jet’s captain, informing him to get ready to return to Shanghai.</p><p>Jingmen Island.</p><p>Everlasting Feast Hall’s HQ, the seabed, on the exquisite pagoda’s seventh floor.</p><p>A chilling cold atmosphere filled the entire space of the seventh floor, the glistening azure light scattered from the ice bed as Gu Yan’er’s eyelashes fluttered. Her eyes slowly opened as a fluctuating aura emitted out of her body. In a flash, a colder aura spread in all directions.</p><p>“How long have I been in slumber this time?”</p><p>Gu Yan’er slowly sat on the ice bed. Her slender jade-like fingers gently rubbed her brows. Her beauty was such as able to overthrow cities and ruin nations, enough to enchant all the peerless men in the world, yet it showed a bitter and agonized expression.</p><p>Shoo…</p><p>A ghost-like figure instantly appeared on the seventh floor.</p><p>Gu Yan’er slightly raised her head. Seeing Ji Chimei kneeling directly in front of the ice bed, she said, “Old Ji, how many times I have told you, you really don’t need to kneel every time. In fact… I already regarded you as family when you came with me to Earth to find Master.”</p><p>Ji Chimei’s eyes mister over as an excited expression hung on her face. She looked up and said, “Master, we’ve found Venerable Lord.”</p><p>Gu Yan’er blanked. Her white dress fluttered as she flashed and appeared in front of Ji Chimei in an instant. An imperceptible force then pulled Ji Chimei up instantly, making Ji Chimei stand up at the same altitude as her.</p><p>“You… are not lying to me?”</p><p>“No, this one absolutely isn’t lying.” Ji Chimei shook her head and said, “It was actually Xiaoxue who found Venerable Lord. Moreover, he had also been here several times, and accompanied you for a long time.”</p><p>Gu Yan’er quivered as she let out a smile and asked, “Where’s he? My master… where is he now?”</p><p>“He should be in Shanghai. A few days ago Venerable Lord called me to Shanghai to handle some matters for him. Thus I met him there, and…”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
