But still, he nodded and said, “I’m friends with him! When I went to Tianjin City before I met him there and hang out together a bit.”</p><p>“Just because you you know him a little you think you can ask for a leave? Vice Dean Le is an old school person to my knowledge; someone very difficult to speak to.” An incredulous expression hung on Han Qingwu’s face. She evidently knew a little about Le Baiyi. Moreover, she shouldn’t be on good terms with him.</p><p>“You’re also familiar with him?” Asked Tang Xiu.</p><p>“I’d rather not. My transfer to Shanghai University was very smooth originally. But he… actually…” said Han Qingwu.</p><p>Seeing Han Qingwu stopping her explanation, Tang Xiu immediately revealed a slight smile as he asked, “What did he do?”</p><p>“Let’s not to talk about this topic anymore.” Han Qingwu shook her head and continued, “If anything, you must find a good excuse when asking him for leave. I can help you ask the other leaders in the department. However, as far as I know, the teachers and professors in our department have no rights to decide whether a new student can ask for a leave of absence during military training.”</p><p>“Why?” asked Tang Xiu in a puzzled expression, surprised.</p><p>“The current military training subject is different from the past. In particular, regular military training in university is very strict. Generally speaking, for students who are used to fake excuses for leave of absence, they must participate in the military training, unless they are really sick or not fit to participate.”</p><p>Tang Xiu was silence for a moment, before he slowly said, “I’ll still try it! If I can get it then it would for the best, but if not, then I’ll attend the military training.”</p><p>\"OK!\" Han Qingwu nodded and then asked, \"Then what are you gonna do next? Are you going back to the classroom? Or...\"</p><p>“Are we still going to have class today?” asked Tang Xiu.</p><p>“For the time being, no.” Han Qingwu shook her hand and replied.</p><p>“If so, then I’ll go first. I’m going to the campus library to borrow some books. That’s right. Is it possible for me to borrow books from the campus library now?”</p><p>“It should be,” said Han Qingwu with a smile.</p><p>Tang Xiu then stood up as he beckoned and said, “Then I’ll go the library. You can go busy yourself!”</p><p>Twenty minutes later, when Tang Xiu arrived at the library, he was rendered speechless. Shanghai University’s library was very large; it was at least a dozen times larger than Star City First High School’s. Just merely walking from the main classroom building to the library, it took him twenty minutes. Nevertheless, it was after he took the unnecessary long way and asked directions.</p><p>At this time, a few students were going in and coming out of the library’s entrance. The site itself was rather deserted compared to other places. When he went inside, he was immediately shocked upon seeing rows upon rows of bookshelves lined with books inside a spacious hall.</p><p>“Hi, I’m this year’s freshman. I want to borrow a few books.”</p><p>Tang Xiu went to the work area where several staffs were located and spoke to one of the middle-aged women.</p><p>“I’m sorry, new students are not yet able to borrow books from the library,” said the middle-aged woman with a smile, “Although you already have your university card, but you have yet to apply for a library card. If you plan to borrow books frequently, you need to submit your ID card as well as other information. Then we’ll handle your library card application.”</p><p>“Then I’ll submit all the information you need now!” said Tang Xiu with a smile after having been silent for a moment.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>A few minutes later, Tang Xiu had submitted all the required information. He then walked into the library. Knowledge was like nourishment. The more knowledge one learned the more one could think and understand things out. Although in the truest sense one couldn’t truly grasp geography by only knowing astronomy; yet, having more knowledge in one’s mind could make one’s path in life be faster, easier and steadier.</p><p>It was 11:00 PM. He left the library after reading a book and then found Le Baiyi’s office after asking around.</p><p>Inside the office, Le Baiyi was holding a magnifying glass to observe the lines of a stone. Upon hearing the door being knocked, he put down the magnifying glass and looked up.</p><p>\"Tang Xiu?\"</p><p>“Ah, Professor Le, I’m disturbing you, am I?” said Tang Xiu with a smile.</p><p>Le Baiyi quickly came out of his desk. He let out a smile and then said, “No, no. I’m glad you came looking for me! Tang Xiu, it’s been two months since we last met, right?”</p><p>“Yeah, nearly so!” said Tang Xiu with a smile.”</p><p>Gesturing for Tang Xiu to sit down, Le Baiyi then personally brewed a pot of tea and poured a cup for Tang Xiu. After that, he smiled and said, “It’s kinda fortunate that I met you in Tianjin City before. Otherwise, I wouldn’t have known that a genius would be coming to our campus. Well, have you registered yet? Or is there anything you haven’t completed? Tell me and I’ll help you handle it immediately.”</p><p>“Actually, my coming here this time is because I need Professor Le’s help for two matters.” Said Tang Xiu with a smile.</p><p>“So? Do tell me! As long as I can help, you can rest assured that I won’t refuse.” Laughed Le Baiyi happily upon hearing it.</p><p>“Professor Le, I have some important things that need to be handled. Thus, I’m afraid I won’t have time to attend the military training. Could you open a back door for me?”</p><p>Surprised, Le Baiyi frowned and said, “What do you have to do?”</p><p>“I have to leave for Jingmen Island for a few days. I have some important matters to do there.”</p><p>“I have a good solution for that.” Le Baiyi nodded and said, “I have been researching a subject that requires me to explore and observe some islands’ terrains in the South China Sea. When the time comes, I’ll put your name in the exploration member list, so you won’t need to participate in the military training. I’ll handle the formalities with the campus. So, what about the other matter?”</p><p>“I heard that freshmen must stay in the campus. Can I get an exception for this? Of course, I’ll also stay on the campus often, but…”</p><p>Le Baiyi waved his hand and said, “If you don’t want to live inside the campus, you can apply to live outside! These are only trivial matters. Just give it to me to handle it.”</p><p>Tang Xiu said gratefully, “Thanks a lot, Professor Le. Anyway, do you have some free time at noon? I want to invite you to have lunch with me.”</p><p>Clapping his hands, Le Baiyi replied with a contented expression, “No problem. However, I should be the one treating you. After all, since you’ve come to me, I’m afraid that old geezer in Tianjin City would stab my spine if I not invited you to a meal. Anyways, let’s go to the Tongfu Restaurant outside the campus. I’m a regular there.”</p><p>Tang Xiu smiled faintly.</p><p>Treating him for a meal?! He was naturally unable to let Le Baiyi treat him today. After all, he was the one asking for his help, to begin with!</p><p>After lunch, Tang Xiu refused Le Baiyi’s invitation to drink tea. After parting ways, he went straight to the campus library again. After spending more than an hour reading a book there, he then went to the classroom.</p><p>At this moment, the students present were obviously a lot more than in the morning. It was more than 30 students altogether, and there was only 10 left remaining for the full class. Tang Xiu’s arrival, in particular, attracted everyone’s attention, as many of them whispered about some topics Tang Xiu couldn’t hear.</p><p>“Yo, Brother Tang. Come here!”</p><p>Zhao Liang stood as he faced toward Tang Xiu and waved.</p><p>Tang Xiu walked there and sat himself down. Only then he heard Zhao Liang’s willy voice, “Eldest Brother Tang, now our classmates have really seen it. Our class’s teacher in charge—Teacher Han really came to Shanghai University just for you. When you left the classroom in the morning, it was just like her spirit had left her body. It wasn’t long after meeting the other new freshmen that she went out to chase you.”</p><p>Tang Xiu creased his brows slightly as he shook his head and said, “She might have had her own matters! Alright, let’s change the topic. Who among you knows any fellow senior students here?”</p><p>“Why do you?” Yue Kai was puzzled.</p><p>“Our fellow senior students should be able to borrow books from the campus library. I was planning to borrow a few books there to read. If I can’t borrow them, I wanna know a place outside the campus where I can buy them.” said Tang Xiu.</p><p>“Why borrow them? Might as well buy them directly. Tell me what books you wanna buy. But it’s best for you to make a list of them, though. I’ll drive you out to buy them after we finished everything this afternoon.” Said Yue Kai with a smile.</p><p>“Well, let’s buy it then!” Laughed Tang Xiu and said, “Let’s go out this afternoon and then stroll around after that. I’ll treat you to dinner tonight.”</p><p>Yue Kai raised his thumb and exclaimed, praising, “Woot, Eldest Brother Tang is really impressive. But where are we going to eat tonight?”</p><p>“I just had lunch in Tongfu Restaurant outside the campus this noon. Their dishes are not bad,” said Tang Xiu.</p><p>“No problem.” Yue Kai nodded and said, “Anyways, are your pockets full? If it is, let’s call Zhao Liang and his dorm mates! The seven of us having a drink will surely create a good atmosphere!”</p><p>Tang Xiu nodded, “That’s fine with me! Call everyone.”</p><p>Yue Kai nodded contentedly, but he suddenly whispered, “Have you heard something? The last guy in our dorm who has yet to arrive was injured by some hoodlums because of his heroic acts. He’s hospitalized in Shanghai Hospital now! I heard his injuries are not severe. Nevertheless, it’s impossible for him to come to school during this period. And heck, I’m really envious of him! He doesn’t have to participate in the military training.”</p><p>Acting heroically and getting injured?</p><p>“What happened exactly?” asked Tang Xiu, puzzled.</p><p>“This buddy came across some robbers. Precisely, he helped an old lady get her wallet back. But then he got stabbed by the hoodlums’ knife. But man! He’s quite strong-willed. For fear of delaying his registration to the campus, he pressed and covered his wound, came out of the subway entrance and ran for a few kilometers to our campus. The teachers in the registrar office learned about the situation and reported it to the cops. Later on, they learned after the police investigation that he got stabbed by the hoodlums because of his heroic act. That’s right, the children of that old lady also sent him a pennant flag. Our campus will surely become famous because of this.” Said Yue Kai.</p><p>A trace of smile was revealed on the corner of Tang Xiu’s mouth as he nodded and said, “It seems like we have more brothers in our dorms now. Well then, how about we go to the hospital to visit him?”</p><p>“Some of us has discussed it too, and we’re ready to go to the hospital in the afternoon! Zhao Liang’s dorm brothers also want to go.” Said Yue Kai.</p><p>“Alright, then we shall go together!” said Tang Xiu with a smile.</p><p>At this time, Han Qingwu entered the classroom. As she looked around the classroom and saw Tang Xiu, a trace of a smile immediately appeared on her face as she said, “The students who have just registered, come to me to fill your registration. I’m Han Qingwu and I’ll be your class’ teacher in charge for the next few years.”</p><p>Immediately, more than ten students who had just registered themselves went to Han Qingwu to write their names and phone numbers.</p><p>Knock, knock!</p><p>The classroom’s door was knocked and everyone’s eyes looked at the door’s direction. However, after they saw the girl in front of the classroom, each and every one of them stared blankly in a daze one after another.</p><p>A beauty! A strikingly gorgeous belle!</p><p>She was a very beautiful belle never before seen by almost all of the students in the class.</p><p>“You are?” Han Qingwu was the fastest to react as she asked.</p><p>“I’m looking for Tang Xiu!” said the gorgeous belle with a smile unfolding on her face.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
