Envy and jealousy filled their eyes, crying inside as to why such a striking beauty who could topple a country didn’t look for them.</p><p>Han Qingwu looked at Tang Xiu with slightly creased brows and asked, “Do you know her?”</p><p>“Yeah!” Tang Xiu stood up slowly as a trace of smile appeared on his handsome face. As he walked toward the door, he said, “Teacher Han, I’m going out. I’ll be back shortly.”</p><p>“OK!”</p><p>Han Qingwu’s expression looked a bit strange as she nodded silently.</p><p>A moment after, Tang Xiu walked alongside the belle to the corridor and said with a smile, “Wanying, I did hear you would come to Shanghai University to attend the graduate program, but I never thought you'd really come. Seems like you’re an alumnus here as well.”</p><p>“Since I’m a graduate program student and you’re a freshman, then shall I call you junior fellow student Tang?” said Mu Wanying and lightly laughed.</p><p>Tang Xiu couldn’t help laughing, “Well, might as well call me by my name. Anyhow, is there something you need from me?”</p><p>“Is it not alright for me to look for you?” said Mu Wanying with a smile, “Anyhow, I heard from my teacher that you invited him for lunch outside this noon.”</p><p>Teacher? Le Baiyi?</p><p>“I was asking for Professor Le’s help. It was just time for lunch, so I asked him to have lunch together with me,” said Tang Xiu with a smile.</p><p>“Yea, I did hear teacher say it,” Mu Wanying nodded and then said, “Do you have time this evening? How about having dinner?”</p><p>“I can’t. I promised my classmates to treat them to a meal this evening.” Tang Xiu shook his head and said, “You can come too, or else we can mark for another day.”</p><p>Mu Wanying hesitated for a moment before she shook her head and said, “I won’t go. I don’t know your classmates. How about tomorrow evening? Let’s meet at the campus gate.”</p><p>“Alright!” Tang Xiu nodded.</p><p>“I was very worried that you were not someone easy to get along with.” Said Mu Wanying with a smile,” But since I know from Tang Ying that you’re her younger brother, I feel completely at ease.”</p><p>Tang Ying?</p><p>“You know her?” asked Tang Xiu, puzzled.</p><p>“We’re boudoir friends.” Laughed Mu Wanying as she said, “We’ve been playing together since childhood.”</p><p>“Ah, the world really is a very small place!” Tang Xiu forced a smile and said, “Anyways, I gotta get back to the classroom. Let’s exchange our numbers and meet again tomorrow evening.”</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>After exchanging cell numbers, Mu Wanying left with a smile on her face.</p><p>As Tang Xiu returned to the classroom, everyone’s vision was immediately attracted to him. Han Qingwu didn’t say anything, but Yue Kai, Hu Qingsong, and the others immediately approached him when he sat himself back in his seat.</p><p>“Eldest Brother Tang, my dear Brother, who was that breathtakingly beautiful belle?” With a voice filled with a Northeast accent, Hu Qingsong hugged Tang Xiu’s shoulder affectionately as he asked.</p><p>Following that, Zhao Liang also hurriedly echoed, “Yeah! You mustn’t hide it, Eldest Brother Tang. That kind of stunning beauty is just… really… really drop-dead gorgeous. Man, I’d be content to have my lifespan lessened by 10 years if I had such a breathtaking gorgeous belle as my girlfriend.”</p><p>Tang Xiu was at a loss whether he had to cry or laugh upon seeing them. He could only reply helplessly, “Nope, I’m not that familiar with her since we only had a meal together before. But back then, after she heard that I would study at Shanghai University, she then came visiting me to have some chats. Anyhow, if you really wanna chase after her, I can help you build the bridge.”</p><p>Yue Kai rapidly echoed, “Then she’s mine! You must not compete with me! Eldest Brother Tang, can you give me her number? I’ll treat you to a big meal tonight!”</p><p>“I can’t tell you her number that easily, mate.” Tang Xiu couldn’t help laughing and said, “But I’ll ask her tomorrow about it. Regardless, I’ll give you her number if she’s willing to know you. After all, it’s her number, to begin with.”</p><p>“Damn, it’s just so right to call you Eldest Brother Tang. You really know how to respect a beautiful woman.” At this time, Yue Kai showed a magnanimous verve as he raised his thumb and sighed, “Well, I got no problem with that, so I’ll be waiting for the good news from you tomorrow. Since you’re going to treat us tonight, I won’t snatch the honor. But after filling our bellies, I want everyone to accompany me to the best KTV in Shanghai.”</p><p>“Hehehe. Eldest Brother Tang, you mustn’t favor one and leave out the others, no?” Laughed Hu Qingsong as he said, “You gotta give us her number too.”</p><p>“Yea,” Zhao Liang nodded and said, “A graceful young lady is a good match for a gentleman. All of us here have no girlfriend. So we’ll pursue the lady together! Whoever can hug the belle will depends on each one’s ability! Besides, even if we brothers don’t act, I’m afraid countless cheap men on the campus will go signing up dauntlessly, wave upon wave.”</p><p>Yue Kai thought about it and he also thought that what Zhao Liang said was true. As far as men were concerned, a woman at such a level would always attract them. Not to mention that there were a lot of men with courage nowadays, so it was inevitable that many flies would revolve around her.</p><p>“Okay! But we brothers gotta have an agreement first. Nobody can play shady here. If anyone of us can really win the heart of the belle, all of us will have to give him our faithful blessing.”</p><p>“No problem!”</p><p>\"Deal!\"</p><p>\"OK!\"</p><p>The seven or eight guys around Tang Xiu echoed and nodded with satisfaction.</p><p>Observing them, Tang Xiu was secretly speechless inside. He then noticed that Han Qingwu was paying attention to him. Pretending not having seeing anything, he said in a low voice, “Brothers, look. Teacher Han is kinda displeased seeing us gathered and talking here. Let’s talk about how you’ll chase the belle thingy after we leave the classroom, shall we?”</p><p>“Got it!”</p><p>Everyone looked at Han Qingwu. They could see that her expression was kind of unsightly as they then immediately sat straight.</p><p>Yue Kai then raised his hand to cover his mouth as he spoke, “Eldest Brother Tang, it’s really a pity, though. You already have such a striking beauty in Teacher Han. So you mustn’t compete with us for that belle. But worry not, though, for us brothers will compensate you for that. Hu Qingsong will surely wash your socks for the next several months.”</p><p>Hu Qingsong who could hear Yue Kai’s words, albeit vaguely, quickly lowered his head and growled, “Screw off, Yue Kai. Why don’t you wash Eldest Brother Tang’s socks for months, huh?”</p><p>“But I’m the one who’s gonna treat him to a meal!”</p><p>“I can also do that!”</p><p>Tang Xiu, who sat between them and listened to their whispered quarrel, immediately extended his hand to twist their waists. He looked at their faces and spoke in an undertone voice, “If you two keep bickering, I won’t give you the number!”</p><p>There were only a few things to do left in the afternoon class, one of which was the election of the interim class president.</p><p>What made Tang Xiu unable to utter any words was that he was unanimously voted and elected as the class president despite his unwillingness to participate in the election. Following that, a female student was then appointed as the class vice president.</p><p>Quickly, the other student body class’s members were also elected, although it was only temporary. Afterward, Han Qingwu took everyone to get their books and dismissed the class after everyone obtained their textbooks.</p><p>“Tang Xiu, you stay!” Han Qingwu cried out to stop Tang Xiu, who was about to leave.</p><p>Yue Kai, who stood beside Tang Xiu, quickly pulled out his BMW car keys and threw it to Tang Xiu. He then winked at him and called out, “Eldest Brother Tang, drive my car when you go out to our appointment. If you don’t come back tonight, I’ll host the dinner. Also, I won’t lock the door for you.”</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>Tang Xiu grabbed the key and threw a curse back to him. Not only that, Yue Kai and the gang also helped him take his textbooks back to their dormitory.</p><p>Angry and amused at the same time, Han Qingwu stared at Yue Kai. She had been in college before, so she naturally knew what Yue Kai meant.</p><p>“Talk any rubbish again and I’ll make you fail in your English course.”</p><p>“BROTHERS, WITHDRAW!”</p><p>Upon hearing it, Yue Kai ran like hell at once.</p><p>Walking down the boulevard in the campus, Han Qingwu kept silent, and Tang Xiu also wasn’t anxious to speak. The two walked without destination as Han Qingwu eventually turned her head to look at Tang Xiu, asking, “Who was the belle that came looking for you before?”</p><p>“I thought you couldn’t bear to hold any longer.” Said Tang Xiu with a smile, “She’s Professor Le’s student who’s attending the graduate program at Shanghai University this year. I met her in Tianjin City when I got to know Professor Le.”</p><p>Realization dawned upon Han Qingwu as she immediately smiled and said, “Little did I think that you would have such an edge on beautiful women! I recall that, when we were in Star City, there was also a gorgeous woman who came looking for you, right?”</p><p>“How come I have an edge with women?! I’ve always been busy with many things that need to be dealt with, tiring me out to death.”  Tang Xiu forced a smile and said, “Besides, I don’t intend to fall in love for the time being. I even got depressed every time Yue Kai teases me.”</p><p>Surprised, Han Qingwu stared at him blankly and said in astonishment, “Why don’t you want to fall in love? Isn’t being in the university the best time to fall in love?”</p><p>“I’m very busy and I also have to allocate much time for study.” Tang Xiu shook his head and said, “Love between a man and woman doesn’t have any meaning to me.”</p><p>“Why do I taste the vicissitudes of life hearing from you?” Han Qingwu was at a loss whether she had to cry or laugh, “You couldn’t be a hundred-year-old geezer or someone who transmigrated and reincarnated into a new body, right?”</p><p>Tang Xiu smiled and replied, “What’s with transmigration and reincarnation…”</p><p>Suddenly, his body quivered in an instant as his facial expression changed as though having a thunderbolt blasted inside his heart.</p><p>Transmigrating and being reincarnated?</p><p>Realization dawned on him all of a sudden. If Xue Qingcheng were to die in the Immortal World, could she possibly be transmigrated and reincarnated on Earth?</p><p>It had to be known that the Immortal World was only one of the myriad realms. Whereas the Abyssal Hell of Samsara was the place that governed the cycle of Samsara. For individuals who died in the Immortal World, as long as their souls didn’t scatter and disappear, it was possible for them to be reincarnated in the Immortal World or in one of the myriad small worlds. And Earth was also one of those myriad small worlds.</p><p>“Tang Xiu, what happened to you?” Han Qingwu could acutely sense Tang Xiu’s unusual reaction as she asked.</p><p>After falling into silence for a while, Tang Xiu suddenly asked, “Do you have three red birthmarks on your left shoulder?”</p><p>Stunned, Han Qingwu fell into a daze. With disbelief and astonishment, she asked, “How did you know? Even when the weather is hot, I have never once showed my shoulders, no?”</p><p>“You really have them?” Tang Xiu’s pupils shrunk.</p><p>“Yeah, it’s been there since I was born. There are three small red birthmarks shaped in triangular patterns.” Said Han Qingwu, “My parents once told when I was a child that these three birthmarks look like a very beautiful pattern, so I don’t need any tattoos.”</p><p>Tang Xiu’s face turned somewhat pale. He stared at Han Qingwu tightly as he asked word by word, “Who. Are. You. Exactly?”</p><p>Shocked and stupefied, Han Qingwu’s pace came to a stop in an instant. With a bewildered expression, she asked, “Why are you asking this? I’m me!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
