She then walked over and said, “Boss has woken up and is calling you inside.”</p><p>Li Haoran quickly put out the cigarette and nodded. He then faced two bodyguards and said in a deep voice, “Wait for me here.”</p><p>Having said that, he followed Kang Xia inside the villa.</p><p>In the first floor hall.</p><p>Sitting on the sofa, Tang Xiu calmly looked as Li Haoran walked in. He didn’t get up, looking indifferent.</p><p>Li Haoran came in front of Tang Xiu and forced out a smile, “Mr. Tang, it was indeed my mistake last night. I didn’t have enough time to apologize since it was too fast.”</p><p>“The reason you came here is just for telling me this?” Tang Xiu asked lightly.</p><p>Taking out a bank card from his pocket, Li Haoran placed it on the tea table in front of Tang Xiu and respectfully said, “Mr. Tang, please accept this card as a token of apology. The PIN is written on the back.”</p><p>“I accept. Let the enmity between us be written off.” Tang Xiu glanced at the bank card and said lightly, “But do remember, don’t let your son appear in front of me ever again. I might take his life if I were in bad mood.”</p><p>With a subservient look, Li Haoran hastily said, “I still have a little business in Beijing. Tomorrow… no no, today. I’ll send him to work in Beijing today. Also, I will never allow him to take even half a step into Shanghai unless it’s a holiday.”</p><p>“Actually, I’m someone who’s afraid of troublesome matters.” Tang Xiu sighed, “I never feel like acting against anyone if not for them wanting my life. I believe you are also well aware of your son’s conduct. Control him well! The matter between us is settled, but if in the future he accidentally provokes someone your Li Family can’t afford to annoy, I’m afraid you will be less fortunate by then.”</p><p>“Don’t worry. I will certainly discipline him.” Li Haoran forced a smile, “Even if I must resort to special means.”</p><p>“From the looks of your poor spirit you shouldn’t have gotten a wink!” Tang Xiu stood up and said, “You can go back and rest earlier!”</p><p>\"Yes yes yes!\"</p><p>Li Haoran nodded repeatedly as Tang Xiu sent him out. He quickly strode out of the courtyard and hastily left with his two bodyguards. After leaving the villa complex he was secretly relieved.</p><p>Standing beside Tang Xiu, Kang Xia saw that he didn’t take the bank card from the beginning until now. She immediately smiled, “Boss, this token of apology should be quite a lot, right? I guess there should be a million yuan or more inside.”</p><p>A million?</p><p>Tang Xiu couldn’t help but roll his eyes. If it was only a million, that meant Li Haoran was really looking down him. Back then in Hong Kong, the compensation paid by those several families was a hundred times more.</p><p>“Check the card to see how much money is inside. Use it to develop our Magnificent Tang Corp! Although I’m quite poor right now, it’s still money.”</p><p>“You’re poor? If you’re poor then I’m a beggar.” Kang Xia couldn’t help laughing, “Anyhow, you keep it! Our Magnificent Tang Corp doesn’t lack such a little amount.”</p><p>“Haven’t you checked the amount of money in there yet?” Tang Xiu said with a smile.</p><p>Hesitating for a moment, Kang Xia then nodded, “All right, I’ll check it.”</p><p>Two minutes later, Kang Xia looked at the number displayed on her mobile’s banking system. As she slowly and carefully checked it twice, a shocked expression appeared on her stunningly beautiful face, her hands covering her mouth!</p><p>“What’s wrong? How much money is there, to even scare you like this?” Tang Xiu smiled.</p><p>As she loosened her hands, Kang Xia’s lips quivered a few times, as she then murmured, “1 billion! I just counted that string of zeros twice, so I’m absolutely not mistaken. It’s definitely 1 billion. Did Li Haoran unexpectedly give 1 billion as compensation?”</p><p>“He sure is capable!” Tang Xiu nodded, “Take the money. The more financial resources our company have, the better our development. I heard that our company group is spread out all over the country. But does it count for anything? When we’re able to enter the international market, only then can it be counted as a large corporation.”</p><p>While suppressing her shocked expression, a dazzling smile appeared on Kang Xia’s stunningly beautiful face. She then sat next to Tang Xiu, held his neck, and passionately kiss his face. After that, she let out an enchanting smile as she raised the bank card and said, “I originally had a plan, but I had no means to truly implement it due to the lack of funds. But now I’m sure that I can start the preparatory work for the big plan. When our wine, cosmetics, and the healthcare products have officially hit the market, we will have a steady cash flow credited to the account when the time comes. I believe it won’t be a problem to complete this big plan of mine.”</p><p>While stroking his cheek, Tang Xiu let out a smile and asked, “What’s this big plan? Care to share it with me?”</p><p>“It’s property speculation!” Kang Xia blinked her eyes and happily said.</p><p>“Property speculation? When did our company have such a business?” Asked Tang Xiu, puzzled.</p><p>“We don’t have it yet. But we will, later.” Kang Xia happily smiled, “I’ve already sent people to investigate. The joint project in Star City is about to begin. The housing prices will probably skyrocket. Hence, when the time comes, I need to prepare a large number of funds to take over a large number of properties directly. After saving it for a period of time, I believe the housing price will surely skyrocket all of a sudden, and we’ll be able to make a big profit by that time.”</p><p>“Isn’t this malicious practice?” Tang Xiu was surprised.</p><p>“Nope. This doesn’t count as malicious practice.” Kang Xia shook her head and said, “We are one of the developers, to begin with. If we place an internal order, not only will it be cheaper than an external auction, but it will also become our fixed assets. I’ve sent people to investigate this matter. Whether it is the Long Group, or the two parties from Beijing -- Miao Wentang and Shao Mingzhen -- they can’t spend many funds for internal purchases once the project is finished. The Jingmen Island’s Ouyang Family, however, maybe can take over some. But I believe it won’t be a lot.”</p><p>“We just set up the Magnificent Tang Corp.” Tang Xiu couldn’t help but chuckle, “Even if all of our products have hit the market, I’m afraid we can’t amass that much money in such a short time, no? Even with this 1 billion, we’ll only have a few billions in funds. Not to mention what you said about the housing prices skyrocketing.”</p><p>“Boss, even if it’s only a few billion, but after saving it for some time, we can multiply it several times over.” Kang Xia said with a smile, “Isn’t this business plan quite cost-effective?”</p><p>Several times?</p><p>Tang Xiu was startled inwardly, as a light burst out from his eyes.</p><p>After contemplating it for a short while, he then said in a deep voice, “Then start this big plan of yours. But do remember to notify me in advance. I’ll try my best to get a large sum of funds for your operation.”</p><p>“Affirmative!” Kang Xia nodded with a smile.</p><p>Suddenly, as if recalling something, she curiously asked, “Boss, Li Haoran is a shrewd and astute businessman. How could he compensate us with so much money? That was 1 billion! Even if his Li Group does have a big enterprise and lots of assets, but to take out a billion all of a sudden is probably enough to choke them up, don’t you think?”</p><p>“Do you think that a billion is a lot?” Tang Xiu smiled lightly, “About one or two months ago, I had a conflict with some parties in Hong Kong. They are big and well-respected families there. The total added compensation I got from them, was more than 10 billion. I forgot the specific amount, though. But I think it was quite a lot.”</p><p>10 billion?!</p><p>Kang Xia shivered inwardly, as a look of disbelief was revealed on her beautiful face. She suddenly exclaimed out loud, rushing to Tang Xiu’s side. She grabbed his arm with both of her hands and quickly asked, “Boss, since you got so much, what about the money? Our Magnificent Tang Corp is exactly short of it!”</p><p>“Your money-mad appearance is looks great too.” Tang Xiu couldn’t help burst into laughter, “Anyhow, you can forget about it. I have a use for it.”</p><p>Kang Xia was stunned. An embarrassed look appeared on her face. But still, she asked, “What did you use it for? To take over the Everlasting Feast Hall?”</p><p>“Nope. The Everlasting Feast Hall has always been mine. There was no need to purchase it.” Tang Xiu shook his head, “Haven’t I told you about it?! I used it in the Nine Dragons Island...”</p><p>Kang Xia suddenly sobered up. She patted her head and charmingly smiled, “Look at me, I actually forgot about this matter. Anyhow, Boss, I’m really curious. You bought an island. Why do you have to spend so much to reconstruct it?”</p><p>“The Nine Dragons Island will become our supreme headquarters in the future.” Tang Xiu said.</p><p>Supreme headquarters?</p><p>“Will it also count as the supreme headquarters of the Everlasting Feast Hall?” Kang Xia hesitantly asked.</p><p>Tang Xiu inhaled deeply and said, “When I find some time, I’ll take you to the Everlasting Feast Hall’s HQ. When you get there, you’ll know what kind of existence the Everlasting Feast Hall is.”</p><p>“All right!” Kang Xia nodded quietly.</p><p>After having the breakfast, Tang Xiu didn’t go to the Wine Tasting Conference with Kang Xia. Instead, he went to the campus. Though neither the classes or the military training had started, he still decided to go there. He would seize the time while everyone was attending military training to craft interspatial rings.</p><p>By now everything was ready to start crafting. He only needed to wait for the east wind [1].</p><p>And the right time… was exactly now.</p><p>While strolling around campus, watching the young men and women radiating youthful auras as they came and went, Tang Xiu was as though infected by them, his mood turned obviously great.</p><p>Di, di…</p><p>A car’s horn sounded from behind. Tang Xiu turned his head and saw Yue Yang’s BMW slowly following behind him.</p><p>“Eldest Brother Tang, you’re back! We were just talking about you. We were about to report to the police station that you were missing if you had not appeared.” Yue Kai opened the car’s window and smilingly said.</p><p>Inside the car, aside from Yue Kai who was driving, there was also Hu Qingsong on the front seat. However, both fellow’s eyes were red. They apparently didn’t slept well last night.</p><p>“Hey, you two. What the hell did you do last night? Look at your appearance, you didn’t have a good rest, right?” Tang Xiu drilled into the back seat and smilingly asked.</p><p>With a fully thick northeastern accent, Hu Qingsong laughed, “It ain’t only Yue Kai. This kid dragged me to go clubbing! But hey, that was great. That two paper girls last night were pretty good.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
