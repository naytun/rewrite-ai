Although he didn’t sleep all night, he was still full of vigor and spirit at the moment. What he didn’t expect was that Xue Chao’s wife, Du Juan, had already woken up and was busy in the kitchen.</p><p>“Big sis-in-law, it’s so early!”</p><p>After greeting her, Tang Xiu was about to go to the second floor to change his clothes.</p><p>Wearing an apron, Du Juan turned around, smiled and said, “I usually get up early at home. It’s a habit. Boss Tang, a woman came last night. She should be your girlfriend, right?”</p><p>Girlfriend?</p><p>Tang Xiu thought of Kang Xia. He smiled and didn’t explain, only nodded and said, “I got it. Big sis-in-law, don’t imitate Xue Chao in calling me Boss Tang. Just call me Tang Xiu. It’s fine. Well, go busy yourself! I’ll go upstairs to change my clothes.”</p><p>“OK. Go ahead and wait for breakfast.” Du Juan faintly smiled and went back to cooking.</p><p>When he went to the second floor bedroom, Tang Xiu saw Kang Xia still sleeping in a man’s white shirt. Her sleeping posture looked very attractive, curling up sideways like a sleeping kitten. Her sensual mouth occasionally let out a groan, likely having a delicious meal in a dream.</p><p>“Hehe!”</p><p>Tang Xiu chuckled and reached out his hand to draw the blanket and cover her body. He then walked to the cloakroom to take clean clothes. After taking a shower, his whole body felt fresh and refreshed, as he then put on the clean clothes. Just as he came out of the bathroom’s door, he saw that Kang Xia had woken up, leaning on the bedhead, watching him with a smile.</p><p>“You woke up?” Tang Xiu said with a smile.</p><p>Kang Xia nodded with a smile, “Our Gods Nectar won the first place in the Wine Tasting Conference. It was an instant hit. I came back here last night, wanting to celebrate it with you. But you wasn’t home and I couldn’t get you on the phone.”</p><p>With a surprised look, Tang Xiu then picked up the phone on the TV cabinet. After taking a glance at it, he said with a smile, “No wonder there was no sound from it since last night. It turns out its battery is running out and it got automatically shut down. Anyhow, I heard about it. I passed through Jinhui Square in the morning when I came back and saw the news on the large screens in the square. Some media channels reported the situation in the Wine Tasting Conference, focusing on the Gods Nectar. The response and reactions are great.”</p><p>“The opening ceremony will be held three days later. Which place are you going to participate?” Kang Xia said with a smile.</p><p>“I won’t attend it.” Tang Xiu shook his head and said with a smile, “After all, my current identity is a student. It won’t look good if I look too high-profile. Let’s see the sales figure for the first three days. If the sales figure is good, I’ll give you a celebration feast.”</p><p>“Where will you hold it?” Kang Xia said with a smile.</p><p>“I’ll go back to Star City.” Tang Xiu said.</p><p>Kang Xia’s eyes lit up. She was pleasantly surprised as she said, “That settles it then. Anyways, the one living downstairs is your classmate? With his wife and child?”</p><p>“Yeah. He’s my dorm and classmate.” Tang Xiu nodded and said, “That buddy is really amazing. In his first day at Shanghai, he got injured due to helping someone, thus he got hospitalized in Shanghai First Public Hospital. I went to visit him yesterday and found that he was destitute. Furthermore, his wife and son came down from the mountains to Shanghai to find him, and they were staying in the hospital. Hence, I made them come live here.”</p><p>Kang Xia suddenly understood, and said with a smile, “Someone who acts courageously like that at least is not a bad guy. Do you intend to make them live here forever?”</p><p>“That won’t do.” Tang Xiu said with a smile, “After Xue Chao’s wound has recovered, he will have to live in the campus dormitory. As for his wife and child, we’ll see how he would arrange it for them. Well, let’s not talk about their issues. Since you have woken up, don’t stay in bed. Take a shower and let’s go downstairs to have breakfast.”</p><p>“You bought breakfast?” Kang Xiu smiled.</p><p>“Nope.” Tang Xiu shook his head and said, “It’s Xue Chao’s wife. She’s making breakfast downstairs.”</p><p>Kang Xia suddenly understood and leisurely went to the bathroom. After a dozen minutes passed by, she walked out in pajamas. Because she had brought her luggage from the hotel yesterday, she took out a neat set of clothes from the inside and walked downstairs with Tang Xiu, “By the way, I plan to return to Star City in the evening. Do you have anything to do today? You want me to accompany you?”</p><p>“Do you know the current price for fine iron?” Tang Xiu thought for a while and then asked.</p><p>“I don’t know much about this.” Kang Xia shook her head.</p><p>“Nevermind then.” Tang Xiu said, “I’ll tell Chi Nan to take care of it. Anyhow, since you’re going to leave this evening, let’s go buy something! I’m afraid I’ll be quite busy for some time henceforth.”</p><p>“Busy with what?” Kang Xia curiously asked.</p><p>“Crafting tools!” Tang Xiu smiled slightly and said.</p><p>“What tools?” Kang Xia asked with a confused expression.</p><p>“You have yet to officially tread on the cultivation path, so it’s natural that you don’t know about refining tools and such.” Tang Xiu said with a smile, “In the future, after you can sense qi circulation and have a perfect command of it, I’ll tell you about crafting tools.”</p><p>Having said that, Tang Xiu then dialed Chi Nan’s cell number and said, “Help me buy some steel ingots and iron ores. I’ll text you the quantity later. Buy all of them by tonight and send them to the location I’ll tell you.”</p><p>“Affirmative!” Chi Nan quickly complied.</p><p>During the wait for breakfast, Tang Xiu sent a text message with the details, the address where to buy them, and then sent it to Chi Nan. After that, they and Xu Chao’s family finished breakfast. It was a simple breakfast with baked salty cakes, boiled rice porridge, and two portions of hot pickled mustard that were obviously bought from the supermarket. However, outside of those, each person also got a soft boiled egg.</p><p>Simple and economical!</p><p>This was Tang Xiu’s and Kang Xia’s heartfelt evaluations.</p><p>After the breakfast, Tang Xiu said with a smile, “Big sis-in-law, you got good skills in making baked pancakes. It’s delicious. It seems I’ll be having delicious food later.”</p><p>With an embarrassed expression, Du Juan stammered for a while and then said, “I was afraid you wouldn’t like it, Tang Xiu! In fact, I know I made a simple breakfast. If it doesn’t meet your appetite, I’ll make something else tomorrow.”</p><p>“Big sis-in-law, this is actually very good.” Tang Xiu said with a smile, “I have gone through hard days growing up, as well as experienced starving sometimes. Therefore, you don’t need to worry about that. Shortly put, whatever you cook, I’ll eat them.”</p><p>Du Juan finally felt relieved as she let out a smile while cleaning up the dishes. She then said, “That’s great then. Anyhow, I’ll go out to buy food again later. Are you going to have lunch at home?”</p><p>“I’ll be quite busy with some things in the next few days.” Tang Xiu said with a smile, “I’m afraid I won’t be able to come back here temporarily.”</p><p>“Boss Tang, are you going to attend the military training?” Xue Chao asked.</p><p>“No.” Tang Xiu shook his head,, “I’ve asked for a leave of absence from the military training.”</p><p>Upon hearing it, Xue Chao understood that Tang Xiu perhaps really had very important things to do. He then nodded, “Boss Tang, can I ask for your help again?”</p><p>“You can tell me directly if you need something!” Tang Xiu said.</p><p>“Although I have yet to go to the campus for registration, the school authorities have helped me handle the registration procedures.” Xue Chao said, “I heard from Yue Kai and the others that my textbooks have also been brought to our dorm. Can you help me bring those textbooks here if you have the time? It’s just that I don’t want to waste the time doing nothing while recuperating.”</p><p>“I have brought my textbooks, so you can use mine.” Tang Xiu said with a smile, “After you read them, I’ll go to the campus to get yours.”</p><p>“That’s good as well.” Xue Chao replied with a smile.</p><p>Tang Xiu then looked at Kang Xia and said with a smile, “Follow me to buy something!”</p><p>\"Okay!\"</p><p>Kang Xia revealed a faint smile. After greeting the Xue Chao couple, she and Tang Xiu then left the villa. As the garage door was opened, the duo then casually drove a car and departed.</p><p>“Husband, that’s a good car.”</p><p>Du Juan, who was standing in front of the door, turned around and looked at Xue Chao.</p><p>“I’ll buy you a good car later.” Xue Chao said with a smile.</p><p>“You only know how to talk big.”</p><p>Replying with a smile, Du Juan then went back to the kitchen and began to wash the dishes.</p><p>For the whole morning, Tang Xiu led Kang Xia to several stores, buying a lot of yellow paper, cinnabar, pen brush, and other items. They bought all the stock in the stores they passed. In the end, the car’s trunk was fully stuffed and some could only be put in the back seat.</p><p>Afterward, the duo went to Southfield Villa Complex.</p><p>“Boss, what is this place?”</p><p>With a curious expression, Kang Xia looked at the surroundings. Her eyes finally landed on the luxurious villa in front and couldn’t help but ask curiously.</p><p>“This is the other real estate I have in Shanghai.” Tang Xiu said, “The next thing I’ll do is quite important, so I decided to do it in this place.”</p><p>“Boss, you unexpectedly have so many real estates in Shanghai?” Kang Xia was surprised.</p><p>“My aunt gave me some, my father having bought a few of them.” Tang Xiu said with a smile, “I didn’t spend a dime for them, nor did I do anything to get it. Anyways, if you have the time to come to Shanghai later, take these keys and have a stroll around. You can stay in whichever place you take a liking.”</p><p>“Why do I feel like you are raising me like a canary?” Kang Xia smiled and said, “But if you could find someone else to manage the Magnificent Tang Corp, it’s fine for me to become your canary. Making myself more beautiful every day, cultivating flowers and plants, going to cooking class and learning to cook... Don’t people have a say? To tie down a man’s heart is by keeping a hold of his stomach. I can also…”</p><p>\"Stop!\"</p><p>Snappily glaring at Kang Xia, Tang Xiu shook his head and then walked toward the trunk. Moving down everything he bought, he put all of them into the ten square meter garage. Since the garage door was facing the sun, having a higher roof than the average garage and larger, therefore, Tang Xiu selected this place to refine tools.</p><p>After eating lunch, four trucks slowly entered the villa complex. After stopping and parking in front of the villa’s front gate, Chi Nan got down from her sports car behind the four trucks.</p><p>“I have bought all the materials you wanted, Boss.” Chi Nan came to Tang Xiu and reported, “However, since the quantity is a bit big, there are still four trucks loading goods.”</p><p>“Tell the workers to unload the goods first!” Tang Xiu said, “Put the materials in the trucks inside the garage and then have the other trucks park in the yard.”</p><p>Chi Nan complied. More than a dozen porters then moved the materials inside. Then, she came to Tang Xiu’s side and curiously asked, “Boss, with these many materials, do you want to reconstruct this villa or something?”</p><p>“Nope.” Tang Xiu smiled slightly and said, “Don’t ask more. Send me another four trucks of materials two days later. It should be about the same quantity.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
