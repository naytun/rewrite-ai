Tang Xiu moved at an extremely fast speed between the opened rooms in the corridor. Each and every strong man that came out from the rooms would be killed in an instant.</p><p>Like the saying that killing one man for every ten steps, not only did Tang Xiu achieve it, he even did it much better.</p><p>The corridor was tens of meters long. As he sprinted from one end to the other, the enemies that died in his hands amounted to a total of twelve.</p><p>The fierce combat ended in a short period of time.</p><p>After all the enemies in the clubhouse backyard were slain, Tang Xiu and his entourage poured the already prepared gasoline in the spots that were easy to set on fire. The entire backyard of the clubhouse was set ablaze.</p><p>“Brother, it’s done.” Tang Wei came before Tang Xiu with two bodyguards, grinning from ear to ear.</p><p>“Well done.” Tang Xiu nodded and said, “The most important thing in this operation is not to expose our identity, so we must first destroy all the surveillance equipment. Let’s hurry up! We gotta make the best time for the sixth target.”</p><p>Tang Wei was startled as he asked, perplexed, “We won’t burn the front office of the clubhouse?”</p><p>“There are many guests in the clubhouse.” Tang Xiu shook his head and said, “A lot of outsiders will be implicated if we burn the clubhouse now. Besides, even if we don’t burn it, few people will visit this place after tonight.”</p><p>Tang Wei nodded smilingly after hearing it, “You’re right. Fire is something taboo everyone avoids. If I were to spend my time here and experience fire and murder, I’m afraid I’d not come here again in the future.”</p><p>Immediately after, the group of twelve quietly left through the wall.</p><p>A faint smell of blood fluttered in the air as dark clouds had unknowingly covered the sky-filled stars. It was like the whole world had fallen into slumber.</p><p>From these six locations, over 200 experts trained by the Yao and Sun Families were brutally killed. Of the four locations, three Yao and Sun Families’ group companies and an important warehouse had been completely burnt.</p><p>Guan City, Riverbay Manor.</p><p>In front of the window on the second floor of the villa, Yao Xinhua fiercely smashed a crystal cup with a ferocious expression.</p><p>A man and a woman standing in front him didn’t even dare to breathe heavily due to the atmosphere, whereas Topherson and Ai Murui just smoked their cigars on the opposite sofa while fiddling with the firearms in their hands.</p><p>Bam!</p><p>The door was forced open as a pale-looking young man strode into the room and quickly called out, “Young Master, the Ming Ding Group’s HQ was set on fire. Four security guards in the monitoring control room were killed. All the samples stored by the company inside were also burned. The most important thing… is that the new product’s samples and data were inside. This time… our losses are huge.”</p><p>Yao Xinhua’s pupil contracted and his body suddenly trembled. He knew the new product that was researched and developed by the Ming Ding Group. It was a new drug for urethritis. This afternoon, the R&D Chief researcher of this new product had just sent the samples and R&D data to the headquarters and even explained to him the details of the product.</p><p>“Shit! Why did I put those things in the company headquarters?!” Full of regret and fury, Yao Xinhua’s fierce expression became twisted.</p><p>Ring, ring, ring…</p><p>The ringtone of a mobile on the table was sounded.</p><p>Yao Xinhua grabbed the mobile, yet didn’t see the caller ID. He snapped in a stern voice, “What happened now?”</p><p>“Young master Yao, a big incident! Unidentified people just attacked our Sun Family’s nightclub and bath center. A large number of our armed personnel in the Golden Inn Clubhouse were killed and the clubhouse was burned down. The company group headquarters was also burned down and many security guards were killed. My… my younger brother—Sun Feilong also died.” The voice of the Sun Family’s head, Sun Feilei, came out from the phone.</p><p>Despite opening his mouth, Yao Xinhua couldn’t say anything. After feeling stifled for quite a long time, only then did he bitterly say, “Come to the Riverbay Manor immediately. I’ll be waiting for you.”</p><p>“All right!” Sun Feilei replied and directly hang up the phone.</p><p>Yao Xinhua fell into silence. The fierce expression on his face slowly subsided. A trace of a smiling expression suddenly appeared on his face as he sat back on the sofa and muttered, “Interesting. This is very interesting. This kind of style and ability is not Tang Yunpeng’s. He’s the governor of Xusu Province, hence, he can’t something crazy like this. Who is it? Tang Wei? That kiddo does have powerful capital, but how can the Tang Family’s intelligence investigate us so clearly?”</p><p>Nested in the sofa, Topherson suddenly lifted his body and asked, “Captain Yao, do you know about this Tang Wei well? Has he experienced any harsh military training or something?”</p><p>“Where could he have received any military training?” Yao Xinhua shook his head and said, “He’s a playboy of Beijing. He does run some businesses for the Tang Family, but he’s not someone who can do something like this. He just practices Taekwondo, so he’s just a bit stronger than an average person.”</p><p>“It shouldn’t be him.” Topherson shook his head and said, “There had to be an expert among the ones who attacked our people at the Earth Cabinet Factory in Changbu Town. That guy is very powerful, and I’m afraid that I don’t have such amazing skills. I’ve checked all the wounds on bodies of the dead. Many of them were killed by knife.”</p><p>Yao Xinhua’s expression flickered. He was very aware of Topherson’s abilities. If even he felt inferior to the enemy, that meant he had to be vigilant.</p><p>Time fleeted by.</p><p>Half an hour afterward, Sun Feilei arrived at the Riverbay Manor with a dozen bodyguards.</p><p>“Family Head Sun, please take a seat!” Yao Xinhua pointed to the sofa in front and said calmly.</p><p>With a bitter expression, Sun Feilei said, “Young master Yao, my Sun Family has suffered a massive loss tonight! The Tang Family has gone crazy. They have no scruples in attacking our Sun Family’s businesses. What is most difficult for me to accept is that they know the sites in our Sun Family’s turf like the palm of their hands. The surprise attacks were very fast and they quickly retreated after succeeding. I had no time to rescue anyone.”</p><p>“Two sites belonging to my Yao Family had also been attacked and we’ve lost a lot of people too. Our Ming Ding Group’s HQ, just like the Starlight Group of the Tang Family, isn’t a place where anyone can go and leave easily either.” Yao Xinhua calmly said, “Shouldn’t you’ve received this news before coming here?”</p><p>“Yes.” Sun Feilei nodded and said, “But what did the Tang Family’s people do, anyway?”</p><p>“I don’t know.” Yao Xinhua shook his head and said, “Tang Yunpeng is already back at Xusu Province. They were originally stationed at Red Maple Villa Complex, but that place is deserted now. The people I sent there to secretly monitor them had been killed too. I don’t know where’s their nest now.”</p><p>“Then, what should we do?” Sun Feilei furrowed his brows and anxiously asked, “We just ate so many losses, do we just sit and wait to die?”</p><p>“Do you think sitting and waiting for death is within my disposition?” Yao Xinhua’s expression turned cold and snarled, “We’ve lost their trails. The most important thing now is to find them and then gather up all of our forces to decimate them!”</p><p>“I have the order to spare no effort on finding those murderers!” Sun Feilei solemnly said, “My Sun Family’s intelligence network is currently operating at maximum speed, so we’ll be able to find them as long as they are still in Guangyang.”</p><p>“The Tang Family had prepared to strike us a heavy blow this night.” Yao Xinhua nodded and said, “Let’s analyze our losses first before focusing on mobilizing our military force. As long as we can find their traces, I’ll personally lead the attack. All the Tang Family’s forces must no longer be in Guangyang Province.”</p><p>“We must uproot the Tang Family’s power and influence in Guangyang.” Sun Feilei said, “Else, I’ll have sleepless nights and will be unable to eat peacefully later. Young master Yao, wait for my good news!”</p><p>“I understand your anger since I am also very angry.” Yao Xinhua nodded and said, “But now is not the time for us to be muddle headed. The Tang Family has a powerful figure. Though I don’t know who the person is, I really want to play this game with him. Sometimes, playing with too weak an opponent is very boring.”</p><p>“But this price is way too big for only having fun.” Sun Feilei forced a bitter smile.</p><p>“Tonight was but only an accident.” Yao Xinhua confidently said, “The opposite party has gained a big advantage tonight. Therefore, they will probably retreat and stay put for the time being. By the way, tell those government officials you’ve grasped to find any means to convict Bai Yang. As long as he’s found guilty of his criminal charges, it will be easier to clean up and eliminate the Bai Family. It can be considered as cutting off one of the enemy’s arms.”</p><p>“Young master Yao, it would’ve been very easy to convict Bai Yang before tonight. It could have been done within a few days as long as we continued pressing.” Sun Feilei helplessly said, “However, what happened tonight is too big. I believe it will definitely cause a stir in the entire Guangyang Province. I’m afraid that even those big forces in the country will know exactly what happened. This time, let alone my Sun Family, even the people above won’t be paying any attention to the Bai Family’s matter.”</p><p>Furrowing his brows, Yao Xinhua then slowly said, “Since we have no way to convict Bai Yang for the time being, then we’ll buy some people in the prison to make him suffer. If that still doesn’t work, then kill him directly. Use any means to forge a scene of him committing suicide and announce it. I believe I don’t have to teach you how to do this, right?”</p><p>“Young master Yao, rest assured!” Su Feilei’s eyes turned bright as he nodded and said, “I guarantee that Bai Yang won’t be alive by tomorrow night.”</p><p>Before dawn.</p><p>Guan City, Hongpo District.</p><p>Not long after Tang Xiu led his squad back to the factory, Li Xiaojie and Gu Lang’s squads also came back. Including Tang Wei and Xue Jie, the five then gathered in the conference room.</p><p>“Alright, let’s talk! How was the completion of the operation?” Tang Xiu was smiling as he lit up a cigarette and took a deep puff.</p><p>Li Xiaojie grinned, “It’s been a long time since I had a happy killing. Tonight, we’ve eliminated 62 enemies. Two men died and four are wounded. But the injured brothers are not in a life-threatening condition.”</p><p>Gu Lan dully said, “We’ve exterminated 74 people, with only three of our people injured. None died.”</p><p>Li Xiaojie fell into a daze for a moment as he then forced out a bitter smile.</p><p>He thought that his group had done the best, but compared to this mysterious Gu Lang, he turned out to be a bit worse.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
