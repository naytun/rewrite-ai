She and the others are accustomed to seeking the living from the heap of the dead. There’s nothing but objectives and missions in their eyes. Thus, no one can snatch your job.”</p><p>What?</p><p>Shocked by Tang Xiu’s words, Kang Xia looked at the fashionable, gorgeous and beautiful Chi Nan. It was quite difficult for her to think that Chi Nan would have such an aspect. She had been abroad for many years. She was naturally aware of information that ordinary people didn’t know.</p><p>These type of people could be called hitmen, and were also known as criminals. But people mostly called them mercenaries.</p><p>Could it be that… that was Chi Nan’s background?</p><p>Chi Nan had a smile hanging on the corner of her mouth as she said, “Boss, you seem to really trust this female subordinate of yours! Nobody else knows my identity except the core members of the Everlasting Feast Hall. But you told her my identity?”</p><p>“She has gotten that opportunity.” Tang Xiu calmly replied.</p><p>The smile on Chi Nan’s face froze. Her eyes shifted to Kang Xia. She couldn’t help but have a look of envy in her eyes. That “opportunity” was something she always dreamed of. But the internal rules of the Everlasting Feast Hall had decreed that, unless they made a great contribution to the restaurant, nobody would have a chance to be taught.</p><p>However, there were only seven people out of a hundred who managed the feat to this day. Beside the Little Boss—Gu Xiaoxue and the four business executive figures Tang Xiu entrusted with that, only two others got that opportunity, Light and Dark. But she also speculated that the two brothers, Mo Āwen and Mo Āwu, had probably gotten that opportunity as well.</p><p>Such being said, in the entire Everlasting Feast Hall, the number was only up to ten people aside from Big Boss Gu Yan’er and the mysterious Elder Ji.</p><p>But now there was actually another one.</p><p>While quietly observing Chi Nan’s expression, Tang Xiu said, “So it is that whenever Heaven invests a person with great responsibilities, it first tries his resolve, exhausts his muscles and bones, starves his body, subjects him to extreme poverty, and confounds his every endeavor. In this way his patience and endurance are developed, and his deficiencies are overcome. This sentence from The Works of Mencius is the one I like the most.”</p><p>Chi Nan looked thoughtful for a moment before she slowly nodded, “I understand what you mean, Boss.”</p><p>Giving a slight nod in response, Tang Xiu then read the documents in his hands again.</p><p>Shanghai, Puning District.</p><p>Zhenfan Villa Complex, Villa B-12.</p><p>Li Haoran was dressed in pajamas as he quietly leaned on the sofa while reading a copy of documents. Lately, he had a very comfortable life ever since he gave most of the Li Group’s businesses to his daughter, Li Dan. Furthermore, the company was also thriving and progressing day by day, making him feel very relaxed.</p><p>However, though his daughter was particularly competent, nevertheless, he must control the emerging issues of the overall situation in the province.</p><p>“Dad, you haven’t slept yet?”</p><p>Li Zhen fiddled with his car keys as he walked in.</p><p>Li Haoran flipped his eyelids and felt a slight headache coming. He was filled with helplessness when it came to this son of his. His mother spoiled him since childhood. And now, he didn’t study and did nothing with his life. He even treated all the reprimands he threw at him like waters off a duck’s back.</p><p>“Little Zhen, come and sit.”</p><p>Nevertheless, Li Haoran still wanted to have a good chat with his son. If things continued this way, he was afraid that his baby boy would be ruined.</p><p>Li Zhen sat at the opposite side of Li Haoran, lifted one leg atop the other and said, “What do you wanna talk about, Dad?”</p><p>“What I want to talk to you about is your work.” Li Haoran said, “Our Li Family has a big enterprise and lots of assets, while your young and old uncles are vying for us! Though your sister is working hard, she is, after all, only a girl. So all of our family business will be handed over to you sooner or later.”</p><p>“Dad…” Li Zhen opened his mouth.</p><p>Li Haoran waved his hand to interrupt him, “Little Zhen, I know what you want to say. But you can’t always laze away all day, don’t you think? I was thinking to give you an advertising company under our Li Group. I want you to manage this company. Regardless of how you manage it, the main thing is to temper you, so that you can become a useful talent in the future.”</p><p>“Dad, back then I made that home appliance company you gave me to close down.” Li Zhen forced a wry smile and said, “And now you want to give me an advertising company? Granted, our family enterprise is indeed very big, but I’m unable to handle it, then I would repeat it over and over again, don’t you think? Besides, I’m aware of my own situation. I’m not someone suited to manage businesses at all.”</p><p>A scowling expression appeared on Li Haoran’s face as he growled, “You can ask if you don’t know about something. Your big sister will help you in dealing with the big stuff, and you will personally experience the other small things. With your big sis helping you, I believe you’ll be able to suceed.”</p><p>“Okay, okay!” Li Zhen hesitated for a long time before he wryly smiled and said, “Since you want me to go to that whatever advertising company, then I’ll go. But you must spend some time with me. I got into trouble and need to solve it for good.”</p><p>“What trouble?“ Li Haoran’s brows raised.</p><p>“Actually, it’s not a big deal. It was a Shanghai University’s student. But his origin and identity are very mysterious.” Li Zhen said, “I’ve sent some people to investigate him a few days ago, but I have yet to clearly know his true identity. Tonight I used some tricks to instigate Yu Zhi to probe that fellow. But at the end of the day, not only was that waste Yu Zhi unable to probe any deep details about him, he was even savagely beaten.”</p><p>“You kids are just like us when we were juveniles. You can’t stay still and behave quietly.” Li Haoran shook his head and smiled, “All right, I’ll tell Little Li to investigate that fellow tomorrow morning. I’ll also help you settle this matter if possible.”</p><p>“I’ll handle this small stuff myself, Dad!” Li Zhen said with a smile, “Don’t worry, I won’t take it lightly! Besides, this shall be the time I prove my own ability, right?”</p><p>Li Haoran couldn’t help laughing. When he was about to reply, his mobile phone suddenly rang.</p><p>“Hello? Why are you calling me so late, Old Gu?” Li Haoran spoke in an undertone voice after answering the phone. A smile appeared on his face as he said, “You also haven’t rested yet, Brother Gu?”</p><p>“Brother Li, you have great wits, but you have a short memory! We, brothers, had an appointment to play mahjong, but you actually never came. You are not asleep yet, are you?”</p><p>“Oh my! You have to forgive me. I was quite nervous and in a hurry lately, so my brain isn’t work well. All right, I’ll go over right away.”</p><p>“No, we’ll go to your house! Get you chess room clean and prepare some tea for us.”</p><p>\"Okay!\"</p><p>The call ended.</p><p>While looking at Li Zhen, Li Haoran said with a smile, “Your Uncle Gu and several others will be playing mahjong here. Go clean the chess room since the maids have already gone to rest! Also, take good tea leaves from my study room and make a pot of tea for us.”</p><p>“No problem.” Li Zhen replied with a smile.</p><p>He got up and walked toward the stairway. After a few steps, he suddenly remembered something and his pace came to halt. He then turned around and said, “Dad, I forgot to tell you about one thing. That fellow found out that I used Yu Zhi to fix him up. Thus, he sent me a text message.”</p><p>“What did he say?” Li Haoran knitted his brows.</p><p>Li Zhen came before Li Haoran, took out his mobile and showed the text message. He then said, “This is his message.”</p><p>After he finished reading it, Li Haoran let out a sneer and faintly said, “Since he wants to visit our home, then let him come! Call the complex’s security guards and tell them… to let that fellow passes directly if he comes later.”</p><p>“All right!”</p><p>Li Zhen obeyed and put his mobile phone away and then quickly walked toward the second floor.</p><p>While looking at Li Zhen’s back as he departed, Li Zhen secretly shook his head. However, he paid no attention whatsoever to Tang Xiu’s threat. In his eyes, Tang Xiu was only bluffing. If he dared to come to his Li Family, that fellow would find it difficult to leave this place safely.</p><p>Twenty minutes later, the complex’s security guards, who already learned about Tang Xiu’s identity, straightly allowed him to enter. The cars quickly arrived outside the B-12 Villa.</p><p>The car’s door was opened by Chi Nan as Tang Xiu came out and took a glance at the surroundings and secretly nodded. This villa complex was indeed an upscale neighborhood. The surroundings were not only beautiful, but it also had surveillance cameras installed everywhere along with many patrolling security guards.</p><p>“Knock the door!” Tang Xiu calmly said.</p><p>After Chi Nan’s instruction, a big man immediately went to the door and rang the bell.</p><p>A moment after, the electric gate to the villa’s courtyard was opened. Two men in suits, one of whom was a stern-looking middle-aged man, came out. Seeing the parade outside, one of them slightly furrowed his brows and shouted, “Who are you people?”</p><p>Chi Nan coldly snorted and said, “Tell Li Haoran that our Boss is visiting.”</p><p>That middle-aged man frowned and said, “Your Boss is surnamed Tang?”</p><p>“Yes!” Chi Nan said.</p><p>The middle-aged man directly moved and made way. He then said lightly, “Our boss has commanded us to let you inside directly if you come.”</p><p>Tang Xiu shot him a glance. When he entered the courtyard, he saw four strong men inside maliciously staring at him. However, after seeing the people around Tang Xiu, those four strong men’s complexion changed and turned solemn.</p><p>Striding forward, Tang Xiu instantly saw Li Haoran sitting in the living room’s sofa. The old man had replaced his pajamas to casual wear.</p><p>“Boss Li is really refined! You even still have time to drink tea this late!”</p><p>After sizing up Tang Xiu, Li Haoran’s brows furrowed when he saw Kang Xia and Chi Nan and the four big men in black suits who came along with him. While he was trying to figure out Tang Xiu’s identity, he stood up and said, “I’m waiting for several friends of mine who will come later to play mahjong. Anyways, are you called Tang Xiu?”</p><p>Instead of hurrying to answer him, Tang Xiu stood in the hall while glancing around. After one or two minutes had passed his vision then returned to Li Haoran as he sighed, “What a good house! This place is not inferior compared to the place I live. Boss Li is a man with abilities, but it’s rather unfortunate that you’ve  given birth to a prodigal son.”</p><p>Squinting his eyes, Li Haoran said with a cold and detached tone, “You have yet to answer my question.”</p><p>Pointing his finger to himself, Tang Xiu said with a smile, “Me? What matter do you want me to answer to you?”</p><p>\"You…\"</p><p>Li Haoran was incensed. He never thought that Tang Xiu would be so arrogant.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
