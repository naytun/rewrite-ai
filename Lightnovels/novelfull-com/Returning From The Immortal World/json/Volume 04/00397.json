What this one knows is that Venerable Lord’s cultivation level is very low. But strangely, the rate of his strength’s advancement is very fast. From the first time this one saw him a few months ago to now, he had a breakthrough yet again, and his strength soared by several levels.”</p><p>Gu Yan’er smiled, but two lines of clear tears fell down from her eyes. The feeling of missing him for thousands of years was akin to a devilish-like obsession. It was what supported her. She felt that it was worth it for being able to say farewell to her Master before her soul disappeared.</p><p>\"Take me to him.\"</p><p>Gu Yan’er waved her arm, allowing Ji Chimei to land on the floor. Her figure then appeared in the pagoda’s seventh floor door. However, just as she appeared on the first floor of the exquisite pagoda, her black eyebrows furrowed as a painful look appeared on her face.</p><p>Ji Chimei’s speed was similarly fast and instantly appeared in front of Gu Yan’er, her body blocking the first floor door.</p><p>“Old Ji, what are you doing?” Gu Yan’er’s complexion turned cold as she growled.</p><p>“You can’t leave the exquisite pagoda, Master.” Ji Chimei shook her head and said, “If it was the first ten years and you wanted to leave, I wouldn’t stop you, but your physical condition is getting worse, so you mustn’t leave. Otherwise, I guarantee you that, before reaching Shanghai and meeting Venerable Lord, you will once again fall into a comatose state.”</p><p>Her complexion changing, Gu Yan’er suddenly sobered up. She even forgot such an important thing due to her anxiousness and impatience. She was indeed desperate, wanting to see her Master, to pour out everything she felt for the thousands of years of hardship she had gone through. But she couldn’t do that, for that would lead her into a comatose due to impatience.</p><p>“Old Ji, I…”</p><p>“Master, I’ll go contact Venerable Lord.” Ji Chime said in a deep voice, “He should come over quickly if I call him.”</p><p>“I feel quite good after waking up this time. It’s as I’m better and more spirited than the last time.” Gu Yan’er inquired, “From my judgment of my own condition, I should… should be able to endure for three days. Tell me, he… can he arrive within three days?”</p><p>Without hesitation, Ji Chimei replied, “Definitely. The transportation means are very developed nowadays. In order to see you before, Venerable Lord also borrowed a private jet. I once heard from him that he’d also take a private jet to immediately rush over here once he heard that you’re awake.”</p><p>Gu Yan’er slowly nodded and held Ji Chimei’s arm. She then softly asked, “Old Ji, tell me about Master. Everything you know, from the beginning. I have to know.\"</p><p>“All right. I’ll tell you everything.” Ji Chimei nodded and said, “But I must go contact Venerable Lord first. After that, we’ll return to the seventh floor, and then I’ll tell you everything I know.”</p><p>“Um, let’s go back!” Gu Yan’er gently nodded.</p><p>On a road nearby South Gate Town, just as Tang Xiu finished the call, he suddenly received a phone call from Ji Chimei. Although he urgently wanted to hurry back to Shanghai to find out about the link between the diamond ring and the Demonic Revival Grass, he still answered the phone.</p><p>“Ji Chimei, what’s up?”</p><p>“Lord, Master has woken up!”</p><p>“Awake? What did you say? Yan’er… she… she woke up?”</p><p>Tang Xiu’s body trembled. His hand anxiously changed the steering wheel’s direction and tilted to stop at the roadside.</p><p>“Yes, Master wants to see you immediately. But her physical condition is too poor, so she has no means to leave the exquisite pagoda. So…” Ji Chimei forced a smile and said.</p><p>“I’m on the way to the airport now.” Tang Xiu said without hesitation, “I’ll rush there immediately. Tell Yan’er to say within the exquisite pagoda and wait for me!”</p><p>“Understood!” Ji Chimei respectfully said.</p><p>After hanging up the phone, Tang Xiu restarted the car. He then called the private jet’s captain again, telling him to not apply for the Shanghai, but to Jingmen Island. Although the captain was very curious, he still acted according to Tang Xiu’s instructions.</p><p>Half an hour later, Tang Xiu arrived at the airport. When he boarded the private jet, the middle-aged captain greeted him and said with a forced smile, “Mr. Tang, I contacted the Star City Airport’s authorities. But due to the time and tight-scheduled routes, I’m afraid we’ll have to wait for two and a half hours to take off.”</p><p>“You can’t use any of your contacts at all?” Tang Xiu frowned and asked in a deep voice.</p><p>The middle-aged captain forced a wry smile and said, “We have no contacts in Star City.”</p><p>Tang Xiu took out his mobile phone and called Long Hanwen. After the other party answered, he asked, “Uncle Long, I have something to ask. Do you have any contacts in Star City Airport?”</p><p>“I might have. What exactly do you need?” Long Hanwen’s voice came out of the phone.</p><p>“I borrowed my friend’s private job and it’s now parked at Star City Airport.” Tang Xiu said, “I’m currently in a hurry to leave for Jingmen Island, but my application encountered trouble, so I need to wait for two and a half hours before I can take off. Therefore, if Uncle Long has any way, could you help me contact them?”</p><p>“All right. Wait for my call.” Long Hanwen said.</p><p>A few minutes later, Long Hanwen called again. After Tang Xiu answered, he said with a wry tone, “Tang Xiu, I have no other means either. My old friend told me that the route has been fixed long ago. If there are any unauthorized changes, it will cause 78 flights to become late. How about you wait?”</p><p>“I understand, Uncle Long.” Tang Xiu said, “It’s a bit of a urgent matter, so I’ll try to find another way.”</p><p>“All right!” Long Hanwen regrettably said.</p><p>After hanging up the phone, Tang Xiu fell into silence for a while. Then, he suddenly remembered someone and immediately made a phone call.</p><p>“Big nephew, you rarely take the initiative to call your aunt! How come you remembered to call me today all of a sudden?” Tang Min’s voice came from the phone.</p><p>“Auntie, between your privileges and connections, is there any way to affect Star City Airport? I have an urgent matter to deal with.” Tang Xiu rapidly said.</p><p>Tang Min was silent for a while, before she seriously replied, “If it is a very serious matter, I have a way.”</p><p>“Then, please help me contact them. I’ll tell the captain to tell you about the private jet’s model. I need to go to Jingmen Island.” Tang Xiu said.</p><p>“All right!” Tang Min and the middle-aged captain then talked.</p><p>Quickly, the middle-aged captain then received a call from the Airport authority, as the latter then said, “Mr. Tang you’re really awesome! With just your little effort I already received a few calls. Even the one now was a big shot from the capital. Ah, forget it. I just made adjustments, so you can take off within half an hour at the most, is that all right?”</p><p>The middle-aged captain shot Tang Xiu a glance and was secretly shocked. Though he knew that Tang Xiu had made several phone calls, he knew that the last person he called was his aunt. Yet, he didn’t expect that Tang Xiu’s aunt would have so much power. Even the top leader of Star City Airport had to alter the route of the other flights.</p><p>“Mr. Tang, how about within half an hour?”</p><p>The middle-aged captain covered the microphone and murmured to Tang Xiu.</p><p>“That’s all right!” Tang Xiu nodded.</p><p>“Thanks, Chief. It’s not a problem.” The middle-aged man then replied through the phone.</p><p>Beijing, inside a certain government building.</p><p>After hanging up the phone, Tang Min’s eyes glinted and she looked thoughtful. She was a bit curious as to why Tang Xiu was so anxious to leave for Jingmen Island. Although she didn’t have much contact with her own nephew, she knew many things about her biological nephew through what he had done. She knew that Tang Xiu was a young man with steady personality, and he could do well regardless of any matters.</p><p>Just two and half an hours! Yet, he couldn’t sit still for two hours. He even needed to ask her for help. Thus, he probably ran into an extremely important matter.</p><p>Tang Min immediately grabbed the phone from her desk and dialed a number.</p><p>“Father, Xiu just called me, he wanted me to help him…”</p><p>Beijing, in the Tangs ancestral residence.</p><p>Tang Guosheng was holding a paper and a pen. He was deep in thought about some matters. After receiving the call from his daughter and hearing the content, his face turned solemn. After being in silence for a while, he slowly said, “I got it. I’ll call him myself.”</p><p>Tang Guosheng hung up the phone and dialed Tang Xiu’s number.</p><p>“Xiu’er, I just heard that you must you leave for Jingmen Island from Star City, is that right? What important matter you must handle? You must tell grandpa if something’s wrong. I’ll even give my remaining short life to help you solve it.” In order not to be repelled by Tang Xiu, Tang Guosheng immediately said words filled with concern.</p><p>“Grandpa, I indeed have an important matter. But the Tang Family won’t be able to help in this matter.” Tang Xiu said, “Besides, I don’t need anyone to help either. The reason why I’m so urgent to leave for Jingmen Island is that I need to see someone. That person is someone very important to me!”</p><p>Tang Guosheng suddenly understood, yet he was still a bit worried, “It’s great if there’s no danger! Xiu’er, I know you’re very powerful, but you must remember that it’s difficult to face four enemies with only two fists. You must promptly tell Grandpa if anything happens. My body is quite tough now, so I can help you bear the burden as well.”</p><p>“I know, Grandpa!” Tang Xiu said.</p><p>After hesitating for a moment, Tang Guosheng then said, “Can you tell me who is the person you must see in Jingmen Island…”</p><p>Tang Xiu was silent for a while, and then slowly said, “She’s my disciple.”</p><p>With a slight change in countenance, Tang Guosheng then said in a deep voice, “I understand! I won’t ask anything else. But, do pay attention to your safety.”</p><p>“All right!”</p><p>After the call ended, Tang Guosheng’s brows slightly furrowed. He knew a lot of things about Tang Xiu’s matters. He also learned that Tang Xiu had four disciples. One of whom was Chen Zhizhong. Another one was a little girl, Gu Yin. And the other one was in the Star City Chinese Medical Hospital.</p><p>As for the other one, he had sent people to inquire before, however, there no news at all.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
