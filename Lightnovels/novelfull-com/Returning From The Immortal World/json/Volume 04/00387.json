Take it first. I’ll see you again two days later, and I’ll bring some extra cash for you then.”</p><p>With a grateful look, Xue Chao looked at Tang Xiu and said, “It’s enough. This much is enough. Tang… Eldest Brother Tang, I can’t thank you enough for this great benevolence. But I’ll remember this favor. I’ll look for work after I have recovered from my injury, a part-time one, and I’ll pay you back as fast as possible.”</p><p>“There’s no hurry.” Tang Xiu shook his head and said, “A few thousand yuan is nothing for me. Supporting your family and studying are your priority now. So, just recover from your injury, I’ll help introduce you to a job! You can earn money by working on Saturdays and Sundays.”</p><p>“Do you have an acquaintance? Is the payment good?” Xue Chao was pleasantly surprised.</p><p>“Yeah, it’s an acquaintance of mine.” Tang Xiu said with a smile, “I’ll introduce you later. Looking at my face, you’ll definitely earn more money compared to other places.”</p><p>“Eldest Brother Tang, thanks.” Xue Chao hastily nodded and gratefully said.</p><p>“Let’s leave out the courtesy.” Tang Xiu smiled while shaking his head, “But don’t say anything to Yue Kai and the others, about me lending you money and helping you finding a job.”</p><p>“Why?” Xue Chao was puzzled.</p><p>“No whys. Shortly put, just don’t mention this matter in front of them.” Tang Xiu said with a smile, “Additionally, I think you’re an honest and upright man. I hope you can keep your heart pure after spending more time here. Don’t get lost by the myriad temptations of this dazzling metropolis.”</p><p>“I won’t. My mom said that rivers and mountains may change, but it’s hard to alter one’s nature.” Xue Chao scratched his head and laughed, “My character has been set in stone, while I myself have to support my family. How could I lose myself in the dazzling mundane world with its myriad temptations? In actuality, I understand what you mean. Yue Kai and the others seem to come from families with good financial situations. You don’t want me to unrealistically compare myself with them, right?”</p><p>Tang Xiu let out a faint smile. Just as he was about to speak, a woman appearing to be 22 or 23 years-old, with pale skin and a slim figure, entered the ward. There was a 1 or 2 years old child in her arms, and she wore a concerned and worried expression on her delicate face.</p><p>“Little Juan, come here quickly. Let me introduce you to my classmate. This is Tang Xiu, the other classmates in the dorm call him Eldest Brother Tang. Eldest Tang Brother, this my wife—Little Juan, and that’s my son in her arms.” Xue Chao put down the money as he said with a smile.</p><p>“Hello. That’s a very adorable little fellow you have there!” Tang Xiu greeted her with a smile.</p><p>Du Juan was a bit anxious upon seeing Tang Xiu. Nevertheless, she hurriedly replied, “Hello, thanks!”</p><p>After thinking for a short while, Tang Xiu then turned to Xue Chao and said, “How about leaving the hospital earlier? I’ll arrange you a place to stay. The place is off the campus, so your son doesn’t need to stay in the hospital. You also know the amount of bacterias that gather in hospitals. It could be harmful to the child’s health and growth.”</p><p>“Eldest Brother Tang, this… is not quite proper, don’t you think? You’ve already helped me so much.” Xue Chao was hesitant.</p><p>“It’s all right.” Tang Xiu said with a smile, “Like the common saying goes, do good deeds to the end and send Buddha to the West. You just admitted to owing me a favor, then you can just admit owing me more!”</p><p>Xue Chao was silent for a short while. He then nodded and said, “All right! You… where will you arrange us to stay?”</p><p>“Actually, I have a place outside campus, you can move there and stay with me!” Tang Xiu said with a smile, “We can take good care of each other in this case.”</p><p>“But… your place… can we also stay?” Xue Chao asked.</p><p>“Don’t worry!” Tang Xiu laughed, “A few more people living there is no problem.”</p><p>“That’s great. I’ll tell Little Juan to deal with the discharge procedures.” Xue Chao said.</p><p>Tang Xiu smiled and took Xue Chao’s child. The child was not shy of strangers, instead, he smiled at Tang Xiu. However, his body was a bit hot, which made Tang Xiu’s expression slightly change.</p><p>“Xue Chao, wait here for a while. I’ll see a doctor to check his body temperature. We have to take good care of this child’s illness before we leave.”</p><p>Having said that, Tang Xiu hugged the child and left the ward. Outside, he called a nurse to help examine the boy’s body temperature. It turned out that he only had a low fever and the nurse suggested to lower it with external cooling. In fact, Tang Xiu himself understood medicine and knew perfectly well about the child’s condition. He just did this to make Xue Chao relieved.</p><p>Half an hour later, Tang Xiu carried two big baggage in one hand while his other hand propped up Xue Chao, leading Du Juan and their son leaving the hospital. He then intercepted a taxi outside and quickly went to Bluestar Villa Complex.</p><p>As for the reason why he brought Xue Chao’s family to stay with him together in Bluestar Villa Complex. Firstly, it was because he wanted to help them. Secondly, he also wanted them to help take care of the villa. At the very least, there would be someone to do every day’s cleaning, keeping everything in order, or buying some groceries.</p><p>It's said that children who come from poor backgrounds manage their households from an early age. He believed that either Xue Chao or Du Juan were also able to cook. Additionally, he actually had thought it over. Even if he was studying at Shanghai University, he’d probably leave often and keep busy with some other things, leaving the villa unoccupied.</p><p>However, it was also easy to expose that he was rich in this case.</p><p>At the Bluestar Villa Complex’s entrance.</p><p>After paying the taxi fare, Tang Xiu helped Xue Chao out. After that, he picked up the baggage in the trunk and then waved to a security guard.</p><p>“Hello, can you give us a ride?” Tang Xiu asked.</p><p>The security guard was surprised as he saw Xue Chao’s family of three. He then said with a smile, “No problem. Please wait a bit, Mr. Tang. I’ll immediately call the patrol over.”</p><p>\"Thank you!\"</p><p>Tang Xiu took out a cigarette pack. As he found that he had yet to open its seal, he straightly stuffed it into the security guard’s hand.</p><p>At the moment, Xue Chao was a bit startled. He retrieved his eyes from the villa complex’s entrance and looked at Tang Xiu, asking, “Do you live here, Eldest Brother Tang?”</p><p>“Yeah!” Tang Xiu replied with a smile.</p><p>Despite opening his mouth, Xue Chao didn’t say anything.</p><p>“Xue Chao, this is nothing but a material thing. Don’t care about it so much.” Tang Xiu said with a smile, “Besides, I think you misunderstood something. You should have guessed that I’m a second generation nouveau-riche, right? Actually, I’m not. All the things I have, were mostly gained with my own hands.”</p><p>“I got it!” Xue Chao nodded.</p><p>The patrol car quickly stopped in front of them. After two security guards carefully supported Xue Chao inside, they then motioned for Tang Xiu and Du Juan to board. Without too many effort, they arrived at the villa’s front gate where Tang Xiu was living.</p><p>After thanking them, Tang Xiu watched as patrol car left and then opened the front gate. He then led Xue Chao’s family of three into the villa’s courtyard.</p><p>“Holy mother, this is truly impressive and stylish!”</p><p>Du Juan looked faintly excited. She had never seen such a stylish, impressive villa!</p><p>“It’s just like on TV. It’s really big and impressive.” Xue Chao nodded and said, “I really never thought that I, Xue Chao, can also live in such an impressive house.”</p><p>“We are still young. As long as you work hard and diligently make money, I believe you’ll also have your chance in the future.” Tang Xiu said with a smile, “When that time comes, you can buy a more luxurious villa for your wife and children.”</p><p>“Yeah!” Xue Chao nodded heavily.</p><p>After entering the villa, despite already having imagined how luxurious it was, Xue Chao and Du Juan were still flabbergasted after seeing the decoration inside. They couldn’t utter any words for a long while.</p><p>“Xue Chao, you’re still injured. Thus, you’ll stay on the first floor! There are several guest rooms on this first floor. Discuss with your wife and pick one of them.” After helping Xue Chao sit on the sofa, Tang Xiu spoke to him with a smile.</p><p>“All right, we’ll pick one.” Xue Chao nodded and said, “Ah, that’s, can I take a bath? I’ve been in the hospital for five or six days. I didn’t have a chance to take a bath.”</p><p>“Yup, there’s a bathroom on the first floor. Stroll around and you’ll find it.” Tang Xiu said with a smile, “That’s right. Since you’re older than me, I’ll call your wife big sis-in-law! Big sis-in-law, can you cook? If you can, then we can do grocery shopping and cook food to eat at home.”</p><p>“Yes, I can, so can Xue Chao.” Du Juan quickly replied.</p><p>“That’s great.” Tang Xiu said with a smile, “I’ll give this great and honorable work of preparing food for you. Anyhow, I’ll give you a spare key later.”</p><p>Half an hour later, Xue Chao and Du Juan had selected a good room. The couple hugged their child and had a chat in the room.</p><p>“Little Juan, take this. It’s several thousand yuan.”</p><p>Du Juan stared blankly for a moment, and then asked in astonishment, “Hubby, where did you get the money from?”</p><p>“I borrowed it from Tang Xiu.” Xue Chao said.</p><p>“We have no money, and we now borrowed from him.” Du Juan hesitated before she received the money and said, “We must work hard in the future and pay him back. Not to mention that he’s letting us live in his house. We must remember this favor. We must repay him in the future.”</p><p>“I know. Tang Xiu is a good man and has done us good.” Xue Chao nodded and said, “We’ll be good to him later.”</p><p>“All right!”</p><p>Inside the study room on the second floor.</p><p>Tang Xiu took two keys, one of which was the key to the villa he gave to the couple, and the other one was the key to his other villa in Shanghai.</p><p>It was because he had to have a place to treat Dao Master Ziyi’s disciple. It wasn’t a problem before Xue Chao and his wife came to live in this place. But since there were outsiders now, he could only pick elsewhere.</p><p>After packing up, Tang Xiu then dialed a cell number Ji Chimei had once given him. He agreed to meet her at the Everlasting Feast Hall. After saying hello to Xue Chao and Du Juan, Tang Xiu then left the house directly.</p><p>There were a lot of magical spells and divine abilities he had been unable to use due to his limited cultivation. Furthermore, he was also clueless about the specific situation Dao Master Ziyi’s disciple was in. Hence, he called Ji Chimei over for safety’s sake.</p><p>“I’ll just wait. When the time comes, I can use a lot of magical spells as long as my cultivation is high enough. Although I can’t cast a few spells since the Star Force within me is unable to support it, it’s still better than nothing!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
