I’m a northeasterner, and like most of them, I’m a straightforward person. As long as you guys bare open your heart and are forthright, I won’t be false with you all.”</p><p>“I know the forthrightness of the northeasterners since I have made friends with someone from the northeast a while ago. He’s also straightforward one,” said Tang Xiu with a smile.</p><p>Wiping the bloodstain on the corner of his mouth, Hu Qingsong said with a smile, “I was originally worried that I wouldn’t get along with my fellow students in the university as well as with my dorm mates. Seems like my worries were unfounded. It turns out that you guys are merry and outgoing buddies. Come, let’s have a toast. Anyway, who’s the entertainer today? Do we have enough booze?”</p><p>Apparently, Yue Kai also liked Hu Qingsong’s straightforwardness. He patted his chest and said, “The booze is absolutely enough. I dare order it so long as you can drink it. Only, the two bottles of wine I stole from home had just been drunk up. But there are other fine wines in the restaurant; you’re free to pick them.”</p><p>Raising his glass, Hu Qingsong exclaimed in praise, “Brother Yue Kai is generous. Come, let’s finish this cup and have a chat.”</p><p>“Cheers!”</p><p>Another glass of wine was transported into their stomachs.</p><p>While looking at the purple bruises on Hu Qingsong’s face, Yue Kai asked him, “Old Hu, tell me, what kind of shits did you bumped into on the way here? We drank together, so we’re buddies. Who the hell dares to mess with us, we gotta pay them back!”</p><p>Showing uncaring expression, Hu Qingsong said, “It’s just a small matter. I had just left the campus when I bumped into a few bastards harassing a female student, so I just casually solved those chaps for the girl by myself — one against four — and beat the crap out of them. But… Hehehe, I also got some licks for it, though.”</p><p>“You alone against four?” asked Yue Kai, amazed.</p><p>“Of course! I was a sports team’s member in high school, after all!” Hu Qingsong laughed and said, “Anyways, when I was waiting for the CET result for the north region, my old man kinda insisted in not letting me study anything else aside from history. You might not know, but ever since my family couldn’t find the specific location of my ancestor grandfather’s tomb, my old man has been kinda bewitched. He thought of all sort of methods, including looking for some archaeologists from Beijing. Yet, nobody has been able to find it. Hence, for fear that the future offspring of my family can’t find my father’s grave after he died, he decreed that every generation of my family must study two things: a specialty in history and a minor in archeology.”</p><p>“Your old man is really absurd,” laughed Zhao Liang.</p><p>“Who says he is not?” Hu Qingsong patted his thigh approvingly and said, “Also, a Feng Shui master said that it was due to the Feng Shui of our ancestors changing. He also said that there had been changes in the tomb’s geomancy. What bullshit! I almost asked my old man: ‘why did you let me go study at the university instead of letting me follow that demigod Mr. Feng Shui?’.”</p><p>Pfft…</p><p>“Hahaha!”</p><p>Yue Kai and Hu Qingsong burst into loud laughter.</p><p>Even though Tang Xiu also revealed a faint smile, yet he also thought about what Hu Qingsong said about “the changes in geomancy”.</p><p>He knew array techniques, and naturally understood what geomancy transposition of the tomb was. It was because the natural environment could lead to changes in the land’s Feng Shui. The changes would lead to either greatly ominous omens or auspicious omens.</p><p>After waiting for a moment of silence, Tang Xiu then asked, “Qingsong, may I ask you something?”</p><p>Waving his hand, Hu Qingsong said, “You can ask me freely.”</p><p>“What kind of important matters happened to your family ever since your grandfather lost the location of your ancestral tomb? Have you had good luck or bad luck?” asked Tang Xiu.</p><p>Stunned and dazed for a moment, Hu Qingsong frowned as he thought for a few seconds and then said, “Nothing bad happened. But, some joyous occasions did happen at home several times. My brother married a very beautiful wife who then gave him twin boys, while those two little tigers also grew up strong and look great. They will definitely be like me, becoming tough and able men in the future. Another thing is, my old man’s business got slightly better recently. Hehehe, by the way, I was planning to hang out with my fellow students today, with me as the entertainer. But I didn’t expect that Yue Kai would swiftly snatch it, though.”</p><p>Inwardly, Tang Xiu was perfectly clear that the result of ‘the tomb’s geomancy change’ seemed to lead to auspicious omens, not ominous ones.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The box’s door was trampled from the outside, followed by more than a dozen youths in outlandish attire, as they carried steel pipes and knives in their hands. They blocked the path out and quickly, several young men with bleeding noses and swollen faces came in behind a middle-aged man.</p><p>“Brother Hu, that’s the punk. The one who has a bruise on his face,” shouted one of the youths angrily.</p><p>The middle-aged man looked at Hu Qingsong and sneered, “Little punk, was it you who injured these little bros of mine?”</p><p>Hu Qingsong looked at them and then shifted his eyes toward the dozens of young thugs, suddenly slapping the table. Pointing at Yue Kai and the others, he cursed at them, “Fuck, this father wondered who was calling me here! It turns out that it was you hoodlums who were calling me! What? I have yet to beat the crap out of the three of you, and now you want to shit on me after seeing that others are looking for me too?”</p><p>Yue Kai and Zhao Liang were shocked.</p><p>Quickly, Yue Kai grabbed a bottle in front of him and angrily fumed, “Damn Qingsong, what the hell is wrong with you, idiot? You just told us that we’re brothers, and now you don’t even recognize us? I told you that after we become dorm mates, this Big Daddy will beat the crap out of anyone who dares to shit on you.”</p><p>Despite the obvious fear on his face, Zhao Liang walked toward Yue Kai’s back while conveniently grabbing a bottle.</p><p>Seeing Hu Qingsong still trying to speak, Tang Xiu secretly sighed inside. He patted his shoulder and said, “Alright, no more playing, will you? I know you said that on purpose since you don’t want to implicate us. But, since we’re all classmates, we’ll naturally act together. We’re not some hoodlums, to begin with. Let’s just handle them and send them off!”</p><p>Clap, clap, clap…</p><p>The middle-aged man applauded, “Not bad, not bad. Little Brothers, such a loyal brotherhood is rare these days! Only, one has to pay the price for being loyal. Do you believe you can get out of this box relying only on the four of you?”</p><p>“Humph,” Hu Qingsong snorted coldly and said, “Whether or not we can get out of here is not for you to say! Any fucking idiot who wants to start, I’ll definitely kill him.”</p><p>Sigh…</p><p>The middle-aged man sighed and said, “I still wanted to talk to you, but I didn’t expect that you were unable to appreciate it. Do it! Beat them to death!!!”</p><p>In a flash, more than ten young thugs wielded their steel pipes and knives, striking at Hu Qingsong and Tang Xiu who were at the forefront, whereas another five or six young thugs attacked Yue Kai and Zhao Liang.</p><p>Sighing inside, Tang Xiu instantly grabbed Hu Qingsong’s shoulder and pulled him back to trade positions with him. He then sent out a kick and directly trampled the youth thug’s belly in the forefront, sending him flying and heavily smashing the other two young thugs behind him.</p><p>Bam, bam!</p><p>After snatching a steel pipe, Tang Xiu used it, heavily beating a young thug. Most importantly, he raised up the dining table and smashed it toward the other five or six young thugs surrounding Yue Kai and Zhao Liang.</p><p>The middle-aged man’s expression changed. He took out a dagger from his waist and darted toward Tang Xiu.</p><p>“Roll!”</p><p>Tang Xiu fiercely kicked the man’s chest and punched his arm. The dagger in the middle-aged big man’s hand dropped to the floor as Tang Xiu then slapped him down.</p><p>“ALL OF YOU, STOP!!!”</p><p>Five or six young thugs that had gotten up from the floor slowed down their movements after hearing Tang Xiu’s shout.</p><p>While stepping on the middle-aged man’s face, Tang Xiu sneered, “You can’t go. You disturbed our mealtime today. If you don’t compensate us, I’ll break both of your legs and make you leave by crawling. Either you compensate us for our losses today, or apologize!”</p><p>The five or six young thugs looked at the middle-aged man under Tang Xiu’s foot. They then looked to the other seven or eight comrades who had been badly beaten. They suddenly felt somewhat helpless.</p><p>Glancing at Zhao Liang, Tang Xiu then said in a deep voice, “Go look for the restaurant’s management staff. We got surrounded by strangers when having a meal in their restaurant, so they must take the responsibility.”</p><p>“OK. I’m going.”</p><p>Zhao Liang thought that they would be so badly beaten today that they’d have to be hospitalized. Thus, such invincible might shown by Tang Xiu made him ecstatic. He quickly dashed out of the box and ran to find the management staff.</p><p>Two minutes later, Zhao Liang brought a middle-aged woman along with four security guards.</p><p>After seeing what happened inside the box, the middle-aged woman stared blankly for a moment, as she then looked at Tang Xiu and said, “I just heard that some people caused trouble here?”</p><p>“You just heard it?” Tang Xiu sneered and said, “It was a big fight and quite noisy, how come not even one of your restaurant’s personnel heard it?”</p><p>The middle-aged woman forced a smile and said, “I’m really sorry, Sir. It’s because the boxes are installed with soundproof panels, so we really didn’t know. I did see them when they came in, but I thought they were here to have a meal. Let me introduce myself. I’m the manager of the restaurant, surnamed Xue.”</p><p>“I’m not interested in your family name whatsoever. But I want to ask you. We were having a meal in your restaurant and a gang of local thugs surrounded and ganged up on us. You tell me, are you going to take responsibility for this or not?” said Tang Xiu.</p><p>The middle-aged woman nodded, “Sure, we’ll take the responsibility. Give them to our security guards! I’ll call the police, and I may have to trouble you when they come. Also, I’ll exempt all your spending here today as compensation.”</p><p>“No,” Tang Xiu shook his head and said, “That’s not necessary.”</p><p>Having said that, he kicked the middle-aged man to the side and coldly glared at him as he crawled. He then indifferently said, “You disturbed our meal, so you’ve to pay for all the meals!”</p><p>“Okay, I’ll pay!”</p><p>The middle-aged man had just been miserably beaten, and he could still feel the acute pain in his chest now. He could barely breathe smoothly. He never imagined that this skinny and tanned youth was so powerful. He was also someone who could beat four people by himself, yet the young man before him was even more powerful.</p><p>He was cursing his younger brothers inside his heart, yet he didn’t dare to show it before Tang Xiu and the others.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
