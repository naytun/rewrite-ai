His underestimating the enemy is because he’s too conceited.” Yao Qingzun angrily fumed, “Earlier we had strongly suppressed the Tang and Bai Families and decimated their forces. Yet, the losses were not as bad as tonight’s. Didn’t Tang Yunpeng leave Guangyang? Who was the one leading the operation tonight?”</p><p>“We haven’t investigated it yet.” Yao Chengqing shook his head.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Yao Qingzun smashed everything on the table and lividly roared, “You haven’t investigated it? The enemy has driven us to such a state, yet you haven’t even investigated the identity of our enemy?”</p><p>Lowering his head without speaking, Yao Chengqing and the others didn’t dare to breathe too heavily in such an atmosphere.</p><p>Shameful! They were deeply ashamed.</p><p>After a good long while, only then did Yao Qingzun took a few deep breaths and snapped, “Get Liang Teng to take some men there. Tell Xinhua that, if he doesn’t make any progress, then get the hell out of there and stop disgracing himself further.”</p><p>Liang Teng?</p><p>The expressions on Yao Chengqing and several others’ faces changed.</p><p>“Father, Liang Teng is our family’s strongest secret expert.” Yao Chengqing hesitated, “If we send him to Guangyang Province, isn’t it akin to treating a major issue lightly? Besides, he’s currently leading our people to guard against the Tang Family in Beijing. If he were to leave and the Tang Family…”</p><p>“What would the Tangs do, anyway?” Yao Qingzun waved his hand to interrupt him and harrumphed coldly, “They are nothing but a paper tiger now. They may be able to scare those small families, but will they dare to strike our Yao family so brazenly? Hmph… it’s not like I’m looking down on them, but they wouldn’t dare to attack us even if they had more courage.”</p><p>Staying silent for a moment, only then did Yao Chengqing slowly nodded, “All right! I’ll notify Liang Teng to delegate the security work to the others tonight, and then to rush here tomorrow morning.”</p><p>Shanghai Airport.</p><p>Wearing casual wear, Kang Xia led several employees of the Magnificent Tang Corp to leave the exit gate. A lean statured Su Quan, who looked very intelligent, was tightly carrying a combination-lock black briefcase in his hand.</p><p>“This ain’t right.” Glancing around a few times, Su Quan complained to Kang Xia at his side. “Big Boss Tang didn’t even come pick us up?”</p><p>Glancing at him, Kang Xia let out a slight smile and said, “We didn’t contact him before coming, to begin with. Let’s go! I’ve booked rooms at the Kapur Hotel, so let’s have a good rest tonight. We’ll participate in the Wine Tasting Conference tomorrow. I’ve spent quite some effort to get our place, so I won’t allow any mistakes to happen.”</p><p>“Rest assured, Chief Kang!” Sun Quan said with a smile.</p><p>Kang Xia nodded slightly. The group took a taxi and then arrived at the five-star Kapur Hotel. After settling themselves, Kang Xia took a shower and changed her clothes to a beautiful dress before dialing Tang Xiu’s cell number.</p><p>“You’ve arrived in Shanghai, Kang Xia?” Tang Xiu’s voice was transmitted from the mobile after the call was connected.</p><p>“Yeah, we’ve already settled in the hotel. Anyways, where are you? Are you free now? I wanna see you.” Kang Xia said with a smile.</p><p>“I’m currently in Guangyang. I got an important matter to deal with here.” Tang Xiu said, “I’ll go back after finishing it.”</p><p>\"Guangyang?\"</p><p>A disappointed expression appeared on Kang Xia’s face. After hesitating for a moment, she then asked, “Boss, what are you doing in Guangyang? The Wine Tasting Conference will be held tomorrow. Can you attend it?”</p><p>“I’m afraid not.” Tang Xiu said, “Dealing with the matters here won’t give me any spare time at all.”</p><p>“Then your school…” Kang Xia said.</p><p>“I’ve properly arranged it, so I don’t need to participate in the military training.” Tang Xiu said with a smile, “The new term should be start by the 20th. It should be fine if I go back before class starts. Thus, I’ll have to rely on you to oversee the Wine Tasting Conference’s matter.”</p><p>“Don’t worry! I’ll manage it well.” Kang Xia forced a smile.</p><p>“All right. That will be all.” Tang Xiu said.</p><p>Kang Xia hung up the phone and put down the handbag she just picked up. She then walked toward the window to the see night scene of Shanghai as the feeling of loss inside her heart intensified. She had put down a lot of work this time to leave for Shanghai and personally attend the Wine Tasting Conference. But the main reason was, in fact, because Tang Xiu was here. She wanted to take advantage of the conference to stay with him for a while.</p><p>But then, why did he go to Guangyang?</p><p>Shaking her head and secretly sighing inside, Kang Xia realized that Tang Xiu was becoming busier to the point that she often couldn’t see him for long periods of time.</p><p>Guangyang Province.</p><p>Tang Xiu put down the phone and let out a forced, wry smile. How could he not understand what was in Kang Xia’s mind? Were it not because of the Tang family’s matter, he would have had to meet Kang Xia and have a midnight snack.</p><p>Having a beautiful day in such lovely scene with delicacies and a beauty is surely much better than racking my brains to scheme on the enemy here in Guangyang!</p><p>Shaking his head, the anger in Tang Xiu’s heart toward the Yao and Sun Families swelled. He then strode out of the room after a moment of silence and shouted, “Gu Lang, come see me now!”</p><p>Shoo!</p><p>A silhouette came out of another room as Gu Lang appeared in neat clothes. He then respectfully said, “Boss, do you have orders for me?”</p><p>Tang Xiu said, “I’m in a bad mood and I can’t sleep. Wanna go out and do some hunting with me?”</p><p>Gu Lang’s eyes shined. He nodded without hesitation and said, “I’ll absolutely follow your orders, Boss!”</p><p>“Don’t be so serious.” Tang Xiu waved his hand and said, “Let’s go! Staying idle here means we’re doing nothing. Let’s give the Yao and Sun Families another scare. Ah, right. Call Li Xiaojie, too. Let him be our driver.”</p><p>\"Yes!\" Gu Lang replied and immediately walked toward the next door.</p><p>“Boss, I’ll bring the car right away.”</p><p>Without waiting for Gu Lang to approach the door, Li Xiaojie quickly opened the door as he strode out and grinned ear to ear. He imitated Gu Lang’s address.</p><p>A few minutes later, an SUV drove out of the factory’s front gate. While driving, Li Xiaojie asked with a smile on his face, “Boss, where are we going hunting?”</p><p>“Head to the Sun Family.” Said Tang Xiu.</p><p>Screech…</p><p>Braking, Li Xiaojie was appalled as he called out, “B-Boss? W-we… we’ll go hunting the Sun Family? Are you not joking with me?”</p><p>“Do I look like I’m joking with you?” Tang Xiu calmly replied.</p><p>“Nope. You don’t look like you’re cracking a joke!” Li Xiaojie forced a smile and said, “But still, there are only three of us. If we are to break into the Sun Family’s main base, then we… we’re just courting death!”</p><p>“Regardless of courting death or not, we’ll know after we get there.” Tang Xiu said indifferently, “No more nonsensical talk. You must know where the Sun Family's main base is located, no? Just drive there.”</p><p>\"This…\"</p><p>Despite hesitating for a moment, Li Xiaojie still drove ahead conscientiously. He always thought that Tang Xiu was mature, steady, and resourceful; a very outstanding scion of the Tang Family. Hence, he had never thought that Tang Xiu would devise a spur of moment plan and unexpectedly execute it in such a crazy manner.</p><p>Hunting the Sun Family in their main base?! This was not a joke at all!</p><p>The Sun Family’s manor was very big, and one-third of their forces protected it. It was nearly impossible for three hundred people to lay waste to the Sun Family’s manor, let alone the three of them.</p><p>Li Xiaojie secretly sighed and advertently glanced at Gu Lang. He shivered inside, however, because he found that not only the man did not show the slightest fear, his eyes even brightened up, looking highly spirited.</p><p>Freak! The Boss is a freak, and so are his men!</p><p>Groaning inside, Li Xiaojie could only focus on driving the car.</p><p>Guan City, at the Sun Family Manor.</p><p>The Sun Family manor resided on the bank of an autumn water lake with beautiful surroundings at an excellent geographical location. With the lake at the front and a hill behind, it was situated at the foot of the hill and beside a stream. There were all kinds of flowers and luxuriant greeneries around; even the night was unable to conceal its beauty.</p><p>A few kilometers away from the Sun Family Manor was a road fork, as Li Xiaojie parked the car on the roadside.</p><p>“Boss, you really don’t want me to go with you?”</p><p>“Only Gu Lang and I will sneak inside.” Tang Xiu shook his head and said, “Drive the car a bit far from here as to prevent the Sun Family’s men from finding it.”</p><p>“Roger that. But Boss, please pay attention to your own safety.” Li Xiaojie said.</p><p>Giving an ‘OK’ gesture as response, Tang Xiu and Gu Lang silently approached the Sun Family’s Manor under the concealment of the dim light of the night. Subsequently, Tang Xiu released his spiritual sense to cover a radius of two to three hundreds meters around the surrounding area. With this, he could clearly observe if the slightest sign of trouble appeared.</p><p>“Gu Lang, were you brought up by Yan’er as well?”</p><p>As they approached the outside of the Sun Family Manor’s courtyard wall, the duo didn’t jump over the wall directly but leaned on the bottom of the wall and whispered.</p><p>“Yes!” Gu Lang said.</p><p>“As far as I’m awared, Yan’er has bestowed her surname to six people altogether. Aside from Xiaoxue, you’re the first person I meet with the surname Gu. Looking at your appearance, you should be less than 30, right?”</p><p>“29.” Said Gu Lang.</p><p>Tang Xiu shook his head. Such a short interchange made him a bit helpless. He found a patrol of ten men passing by the wall with the observation of his spiritual sense; thus, he wanted to kill time and chat—despite in whispers—with Gu Lang. Yet, he had never thought that his disposition was unexpectedly true to his surname: solitary and unsociable.</p><p>Several minutes later, the patrol left the scope of Tang Xiu’s spiritual sense. He then pointed to the power grid on the wall and whispered, “I’ll throw you up there. It’s a bit high so you gotta be careful to pick your landing spot and not fall to the ground.”</p><p>Looking at the nearby three or four meters high courtyard wall and the power grid about a meter from the wall, Gu Lang nodded and said, “A four to five meters height is not a problem for me. I once jumped from the third floor and was safe and sound.”</p><p>Jumping from the third floor?</p><p>Tang Xiu couldn’t help looking at him with a strange expression, admiration emerging inside. Even the present him would probably get injured if he were to jump from the third floor without caution.</p><p>“Now!”</p><p>Tang Xiu shouted in an undertone voice as he grabbed Gu Lang’s waist and strongly flung him above. A slight falling sound was heard afterward. Through his spiritual sense, he observed Gu Lang as he borrowed the leverage force and moved akin to an agile leopard cat into the nearby woods and immediately exclaimed in admiration inwardly.</p><p>The next moment.</p><p>By using his tiptoe to step on the wall, Tang Xiu’s body dashed upward while his fingers grabbed the power grid under the wall. With the force of his fingers, he uplifted his body mid-air and then tipped his toe to the spot his finger just grabbed. Although it was only a slight touch, this slightest force pulled his body up more than a meter high as he easily entered the manor’s courtyard.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
