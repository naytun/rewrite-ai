The more he thought, the more excited he was, as the tech products he had once seen in the Loose Spiral Shell Star Area were constantly springing out inside his mind.</p><p>Results and achievements are for those who can visualize their imagination.</p><p>In a short time, Tang Xiu had determined that he could try to research two products. One of which was the Gravitational Flying Disc, the kind of object that could fly by stepping on the start button, which was also the most basic means of travel for the tech race; like the bicycle on Earth. The second object was a type of clothing that could ensure the wearer felt warm in winter and cool in summer, and also was the most basic scientific knowledge of the said race.</p><p>“I must research these, as more and more talents I groom in the future would need larger and larger resources to consume. Relying solely on the profitable channels that are available now would no longer be viable anymore.”</p><p>A firm expression was revealed inside Tang Xiu’s eyes.</p><p>Money was indeed the foundation to gain a foothold.</p><p>Tens of billions, and even thousands of billions! Such an amount mayhap be a very large number for others, but it was not even enough for him because his pursuit and goal. He needed to use money to pave the way and clear up the path to the future.</p><p>Suddenly, Tang Xiu’s expression changed. He was keenly aware of the seats around him. A figure transmitting a very familiar scent and smelling perfume sat down next to him.</p><p>“Lulu?” After Tang Xiu seeing clearly that it was Ouyang Lulu who sat down, his expression was one of surprise.</p><p>Psst… Ouyang Lulu put her finger on her lips and hissed while handing him a box of popcorn.</p><p>Tang Xiu couldn’t help chuckling to himself. After shaking his head, he then asked with a voice that only they could hear, “Don’t worry! There are only a few viewers in this movie hall and they are also sitting in front. Our chat won’t disturb them.”</p><p>“I just want to have a comfortable time watching a movie with you!” Ouyang Lulu let out a faint smile. “I used to feel like I was childish, but it’s kind of romantic now that I’m with you.”</p><p>Cough! Cough…</p><p>Coughing a few times, Tang Xiu turned his head and no longer spoke.</p><p>The 120-minutes sci-fi blockbuster movie still had 50 minutes remaining before the ending. Tang Xiu no longer spoke and neither did Ouyang Lulu, who wore a contented smile while eating popcorn, as her eyes glanced at Tang Xiu once in a while. She even stuffed some popcorn into his mouth a few times.</p><p>The movie ended. Along with the departure of the several viewers in the front row, Tang Xiu let out a smile and stood. After picking up the 3D glasses, he smilingly said, “The movie is over, let’s go out!”</p><p>While holding the popcorn box, Ouyang Lulu stood up and stretched herself in a relaxed manner and said, “I was almost exhausted since I drove the car for six-plus hours straight. I don’t feel like standing up after sitting here and watching the movie.”</p><p>“You haven’t told me yet. How did you end up coming to Blue City?” Asked Tang Xiu in a odd tone. “Also… how did you know that I’m at Clearlake Club in the first place?”</p><p>“I was talking with Long Zhengyu on the phone about some business matters a couple days ago,” said Ouyang lulu with a laugh. “I accidentally learned that you two had a vacation here, so I came. Don’t tell me that I’m not welcome here?”</p><p>Inwardly, Tang Xiu could only force a wry smile. Though what Ouyang Lulu had in mind was no longer a concealed matter to him, he still was somewhat helpless by her passionate and bold pursuit every time he met her. That was why he complained a bit that Long Zhengyu talked too much.</p><p>“Let’s go have a bite! I’m kinda starving.” Ouyang Lulu didn’t wait for Tang Xiu’s reply as she grabbed his hand and walked toward the outside.</p><p>Wang Zidong had been waiting outside the Movie Hall. His mood was a bit complicated when he saw Ouyang Lulu pulling Tang Xiu out. After standing up from the sofa to greet them, he said with a light smile, “You finally came out. I’m afraid that my belly will turn flat due to starving if you didn’t come out.”</p><p>“Eh, why are you here, Wang Zidong?” Asked Tang Xiu with a curious expression.</p><p>“Well, he kinda striked a conversation with me before, and then learned that I came to see you, so he brought me here,” said Ouyang Lulu with a smile.</p><p>There was an awkward expression on Wang Zidong’s face, but still, he braced himself and said, “Heroes love beauties since ancient times. That’s why I thickened up my face and picked up a conversation with you, big sis-in-law. Please don’t mention this embarrassing thing again in the future, else I’ll be dead, becoming a laughing stock by everyone else.”</p><p>“Okay okay. I won’t mention it anymore,” said Ouyang Lulu with eyes turning crescent moon due to smiling.</p><p>Sister-in-law?</p><p>Tang Xiu observed him before turning his head to look at Ouyang Lulu. He suddenly felt the hand on his wrist tightening and immediately came to the realization that Wang Zidong really regarded Ouyang Lulu as his woman! No, something was not right. Even if she was coming to find him, he didn’t need to do that much as addressing her as big sis-in-law, right? This was definitely Ouyang Lulu’s doing, definitely because something she said to Wang Zidong. Upon coming to this thought, Tang Xiu was a bit at a loss whether he had to laugh or cry.</p><p>For a man to have a thick face when flirting and picking up girls was indeed a kingly way, and yet the very principle and the man had been put to use by Ouyang Lulu, thoroughly and incisively!</p><p>She does have guts. I kinda feel like I’m being picked up by a girl here.</p><p>Tang Xiu raised his hand to touch his nose while casting out the absurd thoughts inside his mind and said, “It should be lunchtime now, so let’s have a meal together! Anyways, has Huang Xu come today? If he has, call him over to eat with us here, too.”</p><p>Just a moment ago Wang Zidong was thinking that he was like a third man, thus it was inappropriate for him to have lunch with them. He immediately felt happy upon hearing Tang Xiu’s remark. He was nothing but a third man yet was invited to dine with them. After making a phone call, he then looked at Tang Xiu and spoke, “I just called Huang Xu and he said he’s coming back from the airport and is on the way here. He also wanted me to tell you that Fei Shan also came. Do you also know this second son of the Fei Family, Tang Xiu?”</p><p>“Yeah, I know him,” said Tang Xiu with a smile.</p><p>“Your personal connections are really great, Brother Tang Xiu,” said Wang Zidong with an emotionally sincere expression. “I would have thought that you were a native of Blue City had I not known that this is your first time here! Anyways, the second son of the Fei Family is one that always has his eyes on the top and is kind of bullish and arrogant in front of me.”</p><p>“Fei Shan is a bullish man?” Tang Xiu was surprised. “But I don’t feel him to be like that at all?”</p><p>“Yeah!” While shooting Tang Xiu a convincing look, Wang Zidong could only force a smile inwardly. Upon thinking about it, he felt that it was a given due to Tang Xiu’s identity. Fei Shan was the second son of the Fei Family, but comparing him with Tang Xiu, who was a flamboyant young master from the capital and was worlds apart, the former would therefore naturally not be conceited in front of Tang Xiu.</p><p>The lunch was held and enjoyed by everyone in the Supreme Hall. The travel-worn Fei Shan, who just came back out of town, was even more enthusiastic due to Tang Xiu’s arrival. He also heard that Du Yunjie was taught a lesson by Tang Xiu during the meal, and even Du Yunlong was crushed in his hand, which made the admiration in his eyes increase.</p><p>In the Dining Hall inside the private box on the third floor.</p><p>Li Xiaoqian looked at the four men sitting in front of her with their faces flushed red due to drinking. Sitting on her left was her mentor, an associate professor at the Regal Classical Music Academy, who had strong connections in the music community. On the right was the director, producer, and a regular honored guest of the recent “I’m Crazy About Singing” program on the Blue City TV station.</p><p>Talented in music as she was, she was loved by many teachers and professors in the campus. And this time, her mentor, Tang Zhen, took her out to entertain them in the hopes that she could receive the favor of this group of people in the completion when she participated in the Third Season of “I’m Crazy About Singing” program, and also receive praise from the director and this honored guest. All the while building a bridge of friendship and then through them, finally achieving an excellent position in the competition.</p><p>Yet, this kind of courtesy entertaining was not to Li Xiaoqian’s liking. But still, it wasn’t good to refuse the good intentions from her mentor, thus she could only suppress the depressed feeling inside, sit still and keep them accompany to drink while listening to all the spicy jokes they often spurted out when they were conversing.</p><p>“Xiaoqian! Let’s just enjoy ourselves to the full. Besides, you’re also a good student with a great potential in the Music Academy, too. Just take this glass of wine and after this, we’ll go to the Entertainment Hall to sing while getting high, and then let us experience that wonderful voice of yours first hand.” The director raised the glass while his other hand touched Li Xiaoqian’s back.</p><p>Li Xiaoqian hurriedly pulled his hand back. She took her glass, stood up and squeezed out a light smile on her delicate face, saying, “Director Bao, I have drunk too much wine today and I feel a bit dizzy now. I’m afraid I can’t bear it if I still have to go to the Entertainment Hall to sing. I’ll dry up this glass of wine as a token of respect and then will take my leave first.”</p><p>Having said that, she directly dried up the glass of wine and then reached out to grab her handbag hanging on the chair behind her. However, the middle-aged director put the glass on the table and said with a displeased look on his face, “Xiaoqian, let’s have a good chat here. You suddenly want to go back, isn’t this like sweeping the face of everyone here? If this is the case, I really can’t drink this glass of wine.”</p><p>The male honored guest also revealed a disappointed expression and said, “I’m sure I already told you about my relationship with the four judges just now, Xiaoqian. We are partners in the show and also buddies in private. Most of the reviewers in the media for the final session are also my colleagues. You want to participate in our program and also want to win the first place. Do you think you can do it without me?”</p><p>With brows wrinkled, a dissatisfied expression plastered itself on Tang Zhen’s face. The person he was disappointed with was not Director Bai nor the honored guest, but Li Xiaoqian. Though he was the one hoping that Li Xiaoqian could participate in the “I’m Crazy About Singing” program on the Blue City TV Station, he also could tell that she herself was very excited. And nowadays, one must pay something in return if one wanted something. How many female students desired to start out in public? Didn’t they eventually make some transactions in private?</p><p>Furthermore, it was not he himself who wanted to take advantages of her today! But the ones in front of him. If Li Xiaoqian served these people and then accompanied Director Bai in the evening, she would still possibly end up in the third place and runner-up even if she couldn’t take the first place in the Third Season of the “I’m Crazy About Singing” program.</p><p>“Don’t speak like you’re under the influence of wine, Xiaoqian. Hurry up and drink a cup with Director Bai and the rest. And do apologize to them!” Tang Zhen reprimanded her in a whisper.</p><p>\"I…\" Li Xiaoqian was stunned, and a disbelieving expression appeared in her face.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
