His eyes were unfocused and were evidently in deep thought about something. Behind him, sulky old men looked down with eyes on their noses and their noses in their hearts just like they were statues.</p><p>“I need an answer,” said Gesangjor in a solemn tone after suddenly turning around and casting his sight on the two old men.</p><p>One of the old men slowly raised his head, flipped his eyelids and said, “This is nothing but a risky gamble. Win and our Venom Sect will have endless advantages. Lose and we’ll be beyond redemption. You’re the Sect Master of our Venom Sect, and we shall follow every decision you make.”</p><p>“Fifth Uncle, Sixth Uncle, your ranks among everyone in our Venom Sect are the highest; the only ones from the eighth generation of disciples who have lived to the present. How can I arbitrarily take responsibility for such an important matter?” Gesangjor was so annoyed that he angrily rebuked. “We have yet to be clear about the investigation on Tang Xiu, whether or not he has a dreadful force behind him. Those old codgers may pat their butts and leave, but we have a Sect, family, and businesses to be concerned about. We have no path of retreat at all.”</p><p>“Then just wait and see what will happen,” said the old man indifferently. “I have a hunch that the game between those cultivators has just started, and it’s hard to say who will win or lose. That Jade Beauty told me something the other day, and what she said makes sense to me.”</p><p>“What did she tell you?” Asked Gesangjor quickly with a slightly changed expression.</p><p>“One who is true to his heart will prepare himself for both eventualities,” said the old man.</p><p>“You mean…” said Gesangjor, staring with amazement.</p><p>“Yeah, our Venom Sect is said to have no qualifications to mix our feet in the matter, so why not pull us out of the predicament and benefit from both sides? Those eight families in the Strange Doors put all their eggs in one basket and staked everything to unleash all their power to help Jin Sanchi and Jin Sijie. Those eight fogies all ultimately died in the fight along with many of their elites. And the result? I never believed that Jin Sanchi and Jin Sijie would easily impart cultivation techniques to those eight families. I feel that you should secretly send someone to search for Tang Xiu and pass on the news that these Master and disciples are here to him. With his intelligence, wisdom, and abilities, Tang Xiu should be able to understand that we are showing him goodwill. From the bout between these cultivators, we can obtain friendship from Tang Xiu if we win and may get unexpected benefits by spending little. We won’t have anything to affect us if he is to lose either.”</p><p>Gesangjor’s eyes turned extraordinarily bright as he praised while raising his thumb, “You really are experienced and astute, Fifth Uncle. You intentionally kept me guessing all the while in this matter. There can’t be any idea better than this one. I’ll send someone to contact Tang…”</p><p>He had yet to finish what he wanted to speak as a car’s headlights from the front gate of the hunting grounds shone on the small building’s windows where they were in. The trio quickly moved to look outside the window.</p><p>“Who could be this late?” Gesangjor knitted his brows and spoke in a whisper.</p><p>The old man who just spoke raised his brows and thoughtfully said, “We must never step out of this room regardless of how big the incident is! Just like what we just discussed, we’ll wait and see.”</p><p>“Fifth Uncle, you mean… It’s Tang Xiu who’s coming?” commented Gesangjor, amazed.</p><p>“Just look down there. You’ll know,” said the old man.</p><p>BANG…</p><p>The hunting grounds’ front gate was hit by the Wrangler SUV as it roared and rushed into the hunting grounds. Four security guards in the security room who had just rushed out from the post were silently knocked down and dragged back into the security room, whereas the car continued and stopped in front of the guest building. Tang Xiu and Old Blind then got off together.</p><p>“Daoist Qiankun old fogy, Jin Sanchi, and you Jin Sijie. You, Master and disciples, are tortoises, get the fuck out and see this father! Else I’ll destroy this small building and make you eat some ashes!” Tang Xiu grabbed the spirit spear and instantly released his spiritual sense to lock on the Master and disciples’ trio inside the house.</p><p>“SHITTY BASTARD!!!”</p><p>Daoist Qiankun, who was currently healing himself, was a bit angry as he instantly opened his eyes and smashed the window. His figure instantly appeared in front of Tang Xiu and the others. Even the elites of the eight families and forces of Strange Doors also came out from the building and stood behind Daoist Qiankun and his disciples.</p><p>Tang Xiu sized up Daoist Qiankun a few times and sneered, “Old fart as you are, you should’ve died rather than stayed alive. Living for more than 200 years and yet unexpectedly so shameless to scheme against my men. Are you really that tired of living your crooked life?”</p><p>Daoist Qiankun squinted his eyes and carefully examined Tang Xiu, and then immediately replied unhurriedly, “Are you Tang Xiu?”</p><p>“Yes,” said Tang Xiu bluntly.</p><p>As if looking at a dead man, Daoist Qiankun shook his head and immediately shifted his sight toward Old Blind and sighed, “Seems like you really have become a running dog for this little punk, Old Blind. If it wasn’t that I had to treat my disciple’s injury, how would I allow you to escape last night? And yet, to my surprise, you actually acted recklessly and blindly delivered yourself to me. Don’t blame me for resorting to cruel and malicious means.”</p><p>Old Blind fell silent for a short while and then slowly replied, “This Tang Xiu kid did not heed to this Old Blind’s advice and was adamant on coming here to exact his revenge. Since I’ll need his help in the future, I naturally can’t leave him by himself. I will just lose my life here at the worst, but I’ll be sure to drag you with me.”</p><p>Tang Xiu slightly pressed his brows and lightly said, “Old Blind, you’re not allowed to act unless I can’t hold on.”</p><p>“But Tang Xiu, you…” Old Blind shouted in a low voice.</p><p>“Keep your mouth shut if you want me to provide a place for you to spend your old age in the future.” Tang Xiu waved his hand to interrupt her and said in a deep voice. “I have my own reasons in doing this.”</p><p>With that said, he crazily fed the black spirit long spear with his Primal Chaos Force. He had refined this long spear for many days and to his surprise, this long spear was definitely an excellent weapon as he was able to erupt 50% of this spear’s might with his current cultivation, which was very good in and of itself.</p><p>“Evanescent Chart, Infinite Spear Array!”</p><p>Tang Xiu’s body soared upward and a raging flame suddenly burst out from the spirit spear, as he used the long spear to inscribe the patterns of an array in the air. After throwing the long spear into the air, the array instantly formed and was also activated at once.</p><p>Layers of illusionary spear images formed an array within a 100 meters radius, and the surging airwaves forced Old Blind, Mo Awu and the others back for dozens of steps, directly separating them from the spear range.</p><p>“Spear as Array and I as the Source!”</p><p>Tang Xiu instantly appeared in the core position and his Primal Chaos Force constantly rushed out crazily, instantly turning the area of a hundred meters around into a surging sea of flames.</p><p>“Offensive Array Art?”</p><p>Daoist Qiankun’s complexion greatly changed, while Jin Sanchi and Jin Sijie’s faces were that of horror and dread. The array was a field the Master and disciples’ trio had no knowledge of and only knew a minute bit. Never in their wildest dreams did they think there would actually be someone in this world who was able to arrange an array with such method.</p><p>In a flash, the sky, earth, and the very world changed in the eyes of these Master and disciples’ eyes. Even the dozens of elites of the Strange Doors who were also enveloped in the spear array suddenly found that the world before them was as though had turned into the Ashura Hell.</p><p>Fire Serpent, Fire Bird, Fire Drake, Fire Phoenix…</p><p>Countless lifelike species were as coming to life, as magma from beneath the Earth surged upward, plunging towards them with whooshing sounds. Layers of shadows were like streams of light that constantly moved around them. The whole world was shrouded by the looming destructive aura descending from the firmament as an enormous invisible pressure also enveloped them in an instant.</p><p>AAAARGH…</p><p>A miserable scream came from the mouth of a Strange Door’s elite as a thin fire serpent suddenly drilled out of the boiling rock and plunged towards him, piercing his foot and drilling into his body straight to his heart. The sharp pain consumed his bracing soul as the miserable screams he let out made various kinds of flame creatures storm toward him.</p><p>They dismembered his body and divided his flesh.</p><p>In just a few breaths, that Strange Doors’ elite was fully consumed, and not even a trace of his bones was left. The remaining Strange Door’s people did not fare much better as the number of flame creatures was too many to count and quickly killed them.</p><p>Outside the array, though Old Blind was unable to see anything with her eyes, these particularly unusual parallel images were reflected in her mind. Experienced and knowledgeable she may be, yet never did she dream that she would one day see living humans struggling so desperately while whining and screaming so miserably as their muscles suddenly vanished, bones disappeared, and blood evaporated…. Ultimately, their whole being was completely erased from existence.</p><p>Mo Awu and the experts of the Everlasting Feast Hall, as well as Gesangjor and the two old men who were watching through the windows in the distance with military binoculars, all of them witnessed these uncanny scenes with dread and fear. The feet went missing, legs gone, head vanished, and arms disappeared… until the whole being of a person ultimately evanesced.</p><p>Tang Xiu sneered inwardly. These people from the Strange Doors had decided to stand behind Daoist Qiankun and his disciples, and thus keeping them alive would only leave a disaster to him in the future. He might as well take this opportunity to directly erase all of them so as to avoid future troubles.</p><p>“Daoist Qiankun old fart, Jin Sanchi, and you, Jin Sijie. Your dogs all are dead now, leaving only the three of you, Master and disciples. Enjoy this treat very well. If you three can break this array, don’t you worry about that, for I will make you taste the goodness of more savage means.”</p><p>Inside the array, Daoist Qiankun did not utter anything and neither did he act rashly. He quietly observed the world inside the array despite being extremely shocked inwardly, because this array was something he had never seen before despite his Master once telling him in his childhood that such a formation indeed existed in this world.</p><p>The two brothers, Jin Sanchi and Jin Sijie, also did not act rashly. The two fogeys were all over 100 years old and were also old freak cultivators.</p><p>“WHO THE HELL ARE YOU, TANG XIU?”</p><p>Finally, Jin Sanchi could not bear and shouted. He was able to hear Tang Xiu’s voice clearly, and was sure that it worked the other way around as well.</p><p>However, just as his voice sounded, countless illusionary flame creatures around him howled and stormed toward him. Even the magma surging out from beneath at this moment jettisoned out to the sky to sweep over him.</p><p>A queer expression could be seen in Tang Xiu’s eyes as he laughed loudly and shouted, “Who am I? I’m someone you find difficult to deal with and nearly impossible for you to imagine. Your death is imminent so just go to the infernal hell and be a muddled ghost there!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
