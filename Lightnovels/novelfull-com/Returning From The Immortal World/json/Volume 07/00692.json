Though they were the players in this gambling, the one who benefitted the most was actually her own company. She did not know how many people Tang Xiu was acquainted with, but she had full trust in him.</p><p>Ring ring ring…</p><p>His phone buzzed after Tang Xiu rebooted it. He looked at the screen and the name displayed there was someone he did not expect, Chu Yuan. Tang Xu hesitated for a while, and after he put it through, he said, “Mr. Chu?”</p><p>From the mobile phone, Chu Yuan’s voice transmitted out, “Tang Xiu, I just inquired about them. Those two companies in your text message are indeed listed in Shanghai. I myself don’t have many intersections with them, so it’s rather inconvenient to deal with them. However, my company is preparing an advertising for its product and is currently seeking an advertising company to cooperate with. I just sent a facsimile to the Grace Regale Advertising. Once they receive it and are willing to design the advertisement plan for my company to be carried on with the packaging and marketing processes, I’ll immediately inform the Finance Department to transfer 30% of the deposit for the total investment needed for the advertisements.”</p><p>Tang Xiu hesitated for a moment before replying, “I see, got it. Chu Yuan, if you have some time in the near future, let’s go out for a few drinks. Also, I haven’t seen that little item from you yet! So, we’ll study it the next time we meet.”</p><p>“Alright!” Chu Yuan replied. “Anyways, there’s also another thing. I’m no longer the Young Lord of the Imperial Garden. Even though I’m not completely separated from them, my present identity is the Foreign Affairs Elder of the Imperial Garden, and all the businesses under the Imperial Garden I used to manage have also been taken back. I don’t think I can invest much in advertising for the rest other than my own two companies as of now.”</p><p>“I understand,” said Tang Xiu calmly. He was not particularly clear about Chu Yuan’s departure from the Imperial Garden and why he would renounce such a high status. After all, Chu Yuan could get a lot of advantages by using the Imperial Garden’s channels with that aloof status and would be of great help for his future development.</p><p>However, what the others were thinking had nothing to do with him whatsoever. Chu Yuan showed him goodwill first, thus he only needed to remember this favor.</p><p>Zhang Danyang and Wei Zongchao exchanged dismayed looks. The call Tang Xiu received made them a bit curious, though contempt was still mainly in their minds. It was nothing but bluff and bluster in their eyes.</p><p>Knock, knock!</p><p>The reception room #2 was knocked and the General Manager’s secretary opened the door and came inside in a hurry while bringing two facsimiles to Mu Wanying, and then said excitedly, “Boss, our business department has just received these two faxes. One from the New Idea Training Firm and the other from the Imperial Wherewithal Venture. They are preparing to hand over all the ads of their companies for this year to our company.”</p><p>The New Idea Training Firm and the Imperial Wherewithal Venture?</p><p>Mu Wanying was baffled and seriously read the two faxes with a strange expression. She then forwarded them to Tang Xiu and shot a pitying look at Zhang Danyang and Wei Zongchao.</p><p>That was much a direct shock to Zhang Danyang and Wei Zongchao. They had been running a business in Shanghai for many years and had some knowledge of the New Idea Training Firm as well as the Imperial Wherewithal Venture. Each of these two companies was not inferior to their business at all!</p><p>“Let me see it!” Zhang Danyang got up and directly strode to Tang Xiu’s front.</p><p>Tang Xiu just glanced at the two faxes and handed them to Zhang Danyang with a smile. After half a minute, Zhang Danyang’s complexion turned nasty, and anger could be seen filling his eyes. He knew who sent these two letters of intent to the Grace Regale Advertising… They were the companies belonging to Chu Yuan, a freaking talent of the business community in Shanghai who was also managing other companies other than these two.</p><p>“Do you know Chu Yuan?” Asked Zhang Danyang to Tang Xiu in disbelief.</p><p>“Yeah, kind of.” Tang Xiu shrugged his shoulders.</p><p>Ring ring ring…</p><p>Tang Xiu mobile phone rang again. When he looked at the number displayed on the screen, a smile was suddenly outlined on the corner of his mouth. After putting it through, he directly turned on the loudspeaker and said, “Hey, Brother Zhang, did you read the text I sent you?”</p><p>“I did read your text, Brother Tang. I never heard of Zhang Danyang—that Shunde Door Industry’s CEO, though. So he should only be a small fish. But I know the owner of the Blessed Fortune Jewelry, not a big name either. Yet these bastards dare to annoy my sister-in-law? What impudence! Anyways, I’m going to hand over all the advertisements of my Xinyang Group to sister-in-law’s Grace Regale Advertising for the next three years. Brother Tang, just give me these two bastards to deal with if you don’t have the time to do so! I will make them disappear from the business world in Shanghai in at most a week.” Zhang Yueming’s voice was broadcasted from the mobile phone.</p><p>Tang Xiu let out a faint smile while glancing at the disbelieving faces of Zhang Danyang and Wei Zongchao, “Brother Zhang, there’s no need to bother you in dealing with these two small shrimps. If anything, thanks a lot for this advertising cooperation. I’ll treat you to a drink another day.”</p><p>“Okay, then! I’ll be the one who does the treating later, though, to apologize for my son’s action toward you, Brother Tang.”</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Just as he hung up the phone and was about to speak, Tang Xiu’s phone rang again.</p><p>“Hello, Brother Gu.”</p><p>“What exactly is the situation, Brother Tang? From whence those two bastards jumped from? To think that they even dare to provoke you? Do you want me to employ my network to deal with them?”</p><p>“Thanks for the kind intention, Brother Gu. I’ll deal with this matter myself.”</p><p>“Alright, then let it be since you don’t need me to deal with them, Brother Tang. By the way, my Dingshen Media also has an advertising business, and since sister-in-law also runs an advertising company, I think we can have a cooperation. Thus, I’ll provide some important channels of the Dingshen Media’s advertising business, and the Grace Regale Advertising only needs to pay one yuan annually.”</p><p>“No, Brother Gu. Just give us a cheaper price. You don’t need to exempt us for free.”</p><p>“It’s alright. Our brotherhood is much stronger than money. Anyways, I’ll disturb you no longer, then. Come to visit my Dingshen Media if you have time. I have a good tea here.”</p><p>“Okay!”</p><p>At this time, Zhang Danyang and Wei Zongchao already had a horrified look on their faces. The dignified owner of the Dingshen Media—Zhang Yueming was unexpected… this bloke even had such a deep relationship with him? Suddenly, the duo found themselves falling into a trap that was specifically dug up by Tang Xiu for them.</p><p>This thought sent a chill all over their bodies, and their hearts seemed to have fallen into an ice hole.</p><p>Ring ring ring…</p><p>Just as Tang Xiu connected the phone and turned on the loudspeaker, Jin Xingkui’s voice came out from the mobile, “What about those two blokes who provoked sister-in-law, Brother Tang? Let this Jin Xingkui kill them!”</p><p>“Nah, there’s no need to do that to these two small shrimps. I can deal with them,” said Tang Xiu with a smile.</p><p>“I just learned that sis-in-law is running an advertising company,” continued Jin Xingkui. “If that is the case, then all the advertisements of my Jinda Estate’s marketing will be completely handed over to the Grace Regale Advertising. Also, the new project we are cooperating with, I’ll also hand over its advertisement to them. Shortly put, we are like close relatives, Brother Tang. Just tell me directly whenever you need me to do anything. This Jin Xingkui is ready to risk everything and do it for you beautifully.”</p><p>“Alright, I’ll keep it in mind,” said Tang Xiu with a smile.</p><p>Jin Xingkui did not hang up but continued speaking, “I know who Zhang Danyang is from that Shunde Door Industry. I have had some business dealings with his company before. A few real estate projects I just released to the market were renovated with the cooperation with his company as of recently. I’ll terminate this cooperation with him later. Also, I’ll also spread out the news to the construction companies circle in Shanghai that whoever dares to cooperate with his Shunde Door Industry will have to face me, Jin Xingkui.”</p><p>Hahaha… Tang Xiu could not help but burst into a laughter and said, “Well, it’s your call, Brother! Anyways, let’s meet some other day and have a drink.”</p><p>“Deal!”</p><p>After hanging up the phone, Tang Xiu found that Zhang Danyang’s body was already trembling and slumped down on the sofa with a face devoid of blood. There was also a panicked and horrified look on his face, whereas Wei Zongchao looked somewhat anxious when he looked at him, and occasionally glanced at Zhang Danyang with a bit of a sympathetic look.</p><p>Ring ring ring…</p><p>The mobile phone rang again.</p><p>In the next half an hour, Tang Xiu received dozens of calls, and each caller spoke two matters, one was to deal with Zhang Danyang and Wei Zongchao, and the other one was to give their companies’ advertisement jobs to the Grace Regale Advertising. Tang Xiu directly refused the first one, as he did not need to bother others to do it, though he did accept their offer to hand over the advertising of their companies to the Grace Regale Advertising.</p><p>After more than half an hour, Zhang Danyang and Wei Zongchao were very restless, like they were sitting on a cushion filled with needles. They realized that they had annoyed a big trouble for themselves. This guy before them turned out to be a nobody who loved to brag, but he did have a very terrifying network. Even his identity was perhaps extraordinary.</p><p>What made them speechless was that the business department of the Grace Regale Advertising had received dozens of faxes containing letters of intent and agreements, and also transferred a total of 200 million yuan in deposits altogether to their Financial Department’s public account.</p><p>It was 200 million!</p><p>The total assets of Zhang Danyang’s company were even less than 200 million, whereas the total assets of Wei Zongchao’s company was a little more than that. However, he was not the sole shareholder of the company! Even if he was to add up all his personal assets, it would probably not exceed 150 million.</p><p>Tang Xiu put away his mobile phone, then looked at the two men and casually said, “You two have lost. These two bank cards should be mine, no?”</p><p>Distressed, long-faced, and sorrowful, Zhang Danyang’s face was that of pleading and begging as he said, “Mr. Tang, I judged you like what a dog would do before. Please be magnanimous, do not stoop down to my level. This 20 million is yours, the PIN is 123456, please accept it. And please spare my business and forgive me this once! I’ll immediately move my company from this edifice and never see Boss Mu again in this lifetime.”</p><p>Wei Zongchao somewhat sympathized with him, and was even rejoicing that his Blessed Fortune Jewelry had many branch offices spread out across the country though it was indeed headquartered in Shanghai. In particular was the business in Hong Kong, as it accounted for half of his business shares. Hence, his foundation would not be shaken.</p><p>But Zhang Danyang was different. His business was mainly established in Shanghai. Although he also had a market in the surrounding cities, the amount was pathetic. If Tang Xiu really was ruthless with him, it was highly likely that Zhang Danyang would be done for.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
