He never thought his huge storage of hormones and his straight man identity would actually be questioned. When exactly did he act shillyshally? He was just conscientious over his feelings and never wished to be a womanizer.</p><p>“Goddammit!”</p><p>Despite having a firm self-control and will, the nefarious flame had rushed into the back of his head. Looking at the contempting expression on Ouyang Lulu’s face, he reached out and grabbed her waist and turned her up to make her sit on his lap.</p><p>Ouyang Lulu’s delicate body stiffened. She felt her underbelly meeting with a hard bone-like thing standing up against her most private area and felt her limbs soften, limp and numb. An intense shyness birthed inside her. However, Tang Xiu’s words made her irritated and she retorted angrily, “I know you that you don’t lack women, but I, Ouyang Lulu, am in a class of my own. Even if you have a lot of women now, I’ll defeat all of them in the future. Hmph… I can endure and stay tranquil at the same time, and yet I can also step back and march up towards the sky. If you dare to do it, I won’t be afraid to bear it.”</p><p>“Fuck!”</p><p>Tang Xiu straightly picked her up. After everything was said and done, it was Lulu who sent herself to his door. If he was to admit that he did get aroused, he would really be a damn fool without “balls”. More so that he had long thought about it, that perfecting one’s heart in worldly affairs was to pursue a leisure and carefree life, to be in a state of blissful abstraction. For good or bad, he was once a dignified Supreme in the Immortal World, why should he repress his emotions and be depressed due to fear, to begin with? Granted that Ouyang Lulu was a wild horse, but he could tame her into a docile little sheep in the future.</p><p>Tap tap tap…</p><p>On the bedroom on the second floor, Tang Xiu turned on the light and put Lulu on the big bed, then straightly walked to the window and pulled it.</p><p>“Come…”</p><p>Ouyang Lulu’s pretty face was blushing and looked shy, yet her untamed wild nature soared to the sky as she raised her busty twin peaks. Her eyes were watery like spring water as they intently looked at Tang Xiu.</p><p>Zip…</p><p>Tang Xiu’s hands easily opened Ouyang Lulu’s corsage and took everything off her body in seconds. Her white jade-like body made the nefarious flame inside him crazily surge up, the flame setting the prairie ablaze in just a moment.</p><p>Aaah….</p><p>Amidst the moans, Tang Xiu directly broke the final line of defense.</p><p>Panting and rough breathing, accompanied by seductive moans.</p><p>The awakening spring slowly turned the room warm. Under Tang Xiu’s endless demands and Ouyang Lulu’s initiative to cater to him, the time unknowingly passed by and more than an hour after, Ouyang Lulu began to beg for mercy repeatedly as a heavy curtain closed the affairs between man and woman.</p><p>In the morning, as the first light of the sun shone through the curtain slit into the bedroom, Tang Xiu sat on the sofa in the corner of the bedroom, wearing shorts and a sleeveless shirt. Clamping a cigarette between his fingers, he was silently thinking about what he did last night. He did not regret it since he was, after all, a normal man and was unable to be completely indifferent facing an attractive woman.</p><p>This being the case, he must follow his conscience, then he would accept it as it was. Nobody could predict anything in this world, and he did not feel like thinking much of what the future held, whether it was right or wrong. From the apex of the supremacy of the Immortal World to start from the scratch again, and he even changed his cultivation into a Demon God cultivation technique. Even though the paths walked on by the Immortals and Demons were different, yet the end of the journey was ultimately headed towards the Gods Realm, as they would all then strive to advance toward the highest Primal Chaos boundary.</p><p>Uh…</p><p>Ouyang Lulu, who was drooling on the pillow, slowly woke up from her sleep like a lazy kitten. With eyes half open and blurred vision, she did not see the scene in the room and just sat up comfortably and stretched herself.</p><p>Ouch…</p><p>She couldn’t help but cry out due to the pain in her lower body.</p><p>At the corner sofa, Tang Xiu got up with a faint smile and walked to the bed. He directly lifted her and, amidst her scream, strode to the bathroom. After filling the bathtub with warm water, he took half a drop of Body Refining Liquid and dropped it into the water, and then put the naked Lulu into the bathtub.</p><p>“It will be painful, but you must endure it.”</p><p>Pouting her lips, Lulu did not mind about Tang Xiu’s crude manner, though she did feel a bit shy inwardly. But the pouting she put on could not conceal her happy feelings inside with that happy smile of hers. A dozen seconds after, however, the smile on her face vanished quickly and swayed her lower body unnaturally from side to side with a disbelieving expression in her eyes.</p><p>“It’s painful…” Ouyang Lulu called out and looked somewhat grieved.</p><p>“You have to endure it. It brings about great benefits to your body. The thing I put into the warm water is not something you can buy even for a sky-high price,” said Tang Xiu.</p><p>After half an hour, Tang Xiu took Lulu, whose body was now flushed red, out from the bathtub. She did not scream out of pain again after half an hour of pain. She let Tang Xiu hug her and take her out of the bathtub, wrap her in a beige bath towel, and then return her to the bed.</p><p>“Oh? Why do I feel something strange?”</p><p>As she rested her head on the pillow, she felt a heat flowing inside her body constantly surging and recovering her strength. The sensation made her surprised and fascinated.</p><p>“I put the Body Refining Liquid into the warm water,” said Tang Xiu. “I only put half a drop since your body has an injury, though. But it will still bring about great benefits to you, nonetheless. At the very least, it will double your strength and greatly improve your physical strength. The benefits you got this time, coupled with the abilities you already have, you can beat more than ten small thugs by yourself now.”</p><p>“Is this Body Refining Liquid you really that precious?” Asked Lulu after blinking her eyes.</p><p>“Yeah, it’s something very hard to buy even if you have the money,” answered Tang Xiu seriously.</p><p>A bright smile appeared on Ouyang Lulu’s beautiful face. Though only a small part of her strength was recovered, she jumped up from the bed and threw herself into Tang Xiu’s arm despite still being wrapped in a towel. With a happy smile, she said, “I knew it. You’re even willing to spend that precious thing on me.”</p><p>“Eh, what happened?”</p><p>Being hugged by Lulu’s white arms and feeling her smooth skin rubbing his neck along with her special fragrance, it ignited the flame inside Tang Xiu’s heart again.</p><p>“Eh…”</p><p>Ouyang Lulu keenly felt that a hard object below touched her body. When she looked down, her whole face turned red and she called out, “Scoundrel!”</p><p>Tang Xiu rolled his eyes in response. They may have fought for a long time last night, but the morning was the time when a man’s virility was in its most intense state, as it would also be the first to wake up like a ramrod tower against the sky. And now that it faced a beauty and with him looking at Lulu’s shy appearance, the moment swiftly overwhelmed him…</p><p>9:30 AM. Tang Xiu had neatly dressed and left Bluestar Villa Complex in high spirits. At the moment, Ouyang Lulu was sleeping like a log on the bed. They just had tossed about again for two hours, and she was so tired that she was nearly unable to move her fingers.</p><p>“The Night Orchid’s flower petal gotten from Western Nefarious Sangha is indeed a good thing. Burning it produces a fragrance which can act as a very powerful restorative tonic and is very helpful for sleeping. Lulu used up quite a lot, thus she probably won’t wake up in less than ten hours.”</p><p>After sitting on the back seat, Tang Xiu glanced at Mo Awu who started the car and suddenly grinned, “Awu, considering your age and Awen’s, shouldn’t the both of you find a wife to bear your children? Do you have someone special?”</p><p>A sorrowful light flashed in Mo Awu’s eyes as he replied with a solemn expression, “Women are troublesome. I don’t want to be bothered and be troubled with them anymore.”</p><p>Again?</p><p>Tang Xiu stared blankly and asked with a puzzled expression, “What do you mean? I have the impression that you had a woman before from your words. Did you…”</p><p>Mo Awu fell silent for a long time. Just as the car was about to arrive at the entrance of Shanghai University, only then did he slowly speak, “There was a woman I liked 11 years ago. We were in the same training camp abroad and went through fire and water and did many missions together. We did end up being together later on, but because a bastard from Eastern Europe wanted to kill me and could not find my traces, he bought her information from the Darkwind Organization and threatened me with her. Eventually, she committed suicide in front of me.”</p><p>Tang Xiu’s expression turned cold. He pondered for a moment and then asked, “What about your enemy?”</p><p>“Dead. I tortured him for three days,” said Mo Awu.</p><p>Tang Xiu slowly nodded, looked outside through the window and said, “Your personal enemy died, but that organization that sold her information still exists. Darkwind Organization, isn’t it? Hehehe…”</p><p>“What do you mean by that, Boss?” Asked Mo Awu with a moved expression.</p><p>“The most fearful enemy in the world is not an enemy you can face straight, but the enemy who is in control of intelligence. If I want to be the most powerful man in the world, then I must control the world’s largest intelligence organization. The Darkwind Organization can be said as a latent danger, thus I’ll tear it apart in the future once I have reached a certain level in my abilities.”</p><p>With eyes lit up, Mo Awu spoke without thinking, “Awu is willing to charge through the enemy lines and take the lead for you in the future, Boss.”</p><p>“No worries! You will have that chance,” said Tang Xiu with a smile.</p><p>At the entrance of Shanghai University, donning a black windproof coat and wearing black boots and pink sunglasses, Mu Wanying simply ignored the passers-bys who pointed at her and just watched the direction from the Bluestar Villa Complex.</p><p>“He’s coming.”</p><p>A smile appeared on her cold face. When the car stopped in front of her, she almost without hesitation opened its back door and boarded it.</p><p>“Are you feeling cold?”</p><p>Seeing Mu Wanying wearing a thin attire, Tang Xiu asked with a bit of concern.</p><p>“Nope. I just came out shortly.” Mu Wanying shook her head and smilingly said, “Anyways, did I delayed your business in making you accompany me to my company?”</p><p>Tang Xiu thought of Ouyang Lulu, who was now still asleep at home, and could only force a smile inwardly. Though on the surface, he said, “It’s alright. I’ll still go with you to your company even if the sky is falling down today. Anyhow, you seem to manage an advertising company as far as I know.”</p><p>“Yeah, the name is Grace Regale Advertising. It’s only a small company with thirty-plus employees, though.” Mu Wanying nodded.</p><p>“Actually, given your identity and your meek attitude, your family will probably give you quite a lot of money annually, no? At least it won’t be a problem for you to have a comfortable life,” said Tang Xiu with a smile.</p><p>“No, I rarely receive money from my family ever since I turned 18.” Mu Wanying shook her head. “What happened is exactly the opposite since I must allocate some money annually to pay my Dad’s debt.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
