That fellow acted very low-key yesterday and didn’t even tell him this. Tang Xiu then drove his car inside after asking about the location of the Leisure Hall in Area A.</p><p>After his car disappeared at the end of the road at in the distance, the eight security guards immediately started talking with each other.</p><p>“I never thought the most flamboyant Young Master of the Tang Family, Tang Xiu, is unexpectedly so young. He became one of the scions who come to this club that I admire the most, one of which is our Boss.”</p><p>“No doubt about that. Young Master Tang is the awesome that dared to trash that devil incarnate Zhao Yundi so viciously. I only have a few idols, mind you. And Young Master Tang is definitely one of them.”</p><p>“Yeah, it’s not just Zhao Yundi, he even packed up Yao Xinhua in the South region when the Yaos were in their heyday. He kicked Yao Xinhua and even punched Zhao Yundi, who else could compare with him in the entire Beijing? None!”</p><p>“Unfortunately, we don’t have good statuses, else I would really want to have his signed picture and then bring it back to home.”</p><p>Hahaha…</p><p>After driving the car to the Leisure Hall in Area A, Tang Xiu saw Qin Shaoyang already waiting in front of the building. His men should have informed him, thus he came to greet him in advance.</p><p>“I didn’t come out to welcome you, Tang Xiu. Please don’t be offended!” Said Qin Shaoyang with a smile.</p><p>“I really didn’t expect that you were the owner of Kangde Club, the topmost upscale club in Beijing, to be honest.” Tang Xiu waved his hand and interjected. “I can tell that high social status, financial resources, and connections are required for one to be able to open a high-class club such as this. I’m afraid that only you can afford this.”</p><p>“You’re kidding me, Tang Xiu,” replied Qin Shaoyang modestly. “For me to be able to open up this club was because everyone gave me face and many friends lent a hand, that’s all. Anyways, let’s get inside. Tang Wei and Chu Yi have already arrived, and there are some other friends who learned that you were coming and have been waiting inside.”</p><p>“The friends you just mentioned, who are they?” Asked Tang Xiu while walking.</p><p>“It’s Bai Tao from the Bai Family. I heard that you two are old acquaintances,” said Qin Shaoyang with a smile. “There’s also Mu Dongqing from the Mu Family, a very outstanding and talented young man; and Xiao Chenglin from the Xiao Family, who has long been designated as the future Head of the Xiao Family. Mu Dongqing and Tang Wei are best friends, whereas Xiao Chenglin is inseparable from Chu Yi since they grew up together. I’m afraid that you don’t want to see others, so I didn’t spread out the news to bystanders.”</p><p>Tang Xiu smiled and nodded in response while praising Qin Shaoyang’s astuteness inside. As he followed him inside the Leisure Hall, Tang Xiu and the trio, Tang Wei, Chu Yi, and Bai Tao then greeted each other, before getting introduced to Mu Dongqing and Xiao Chenglin. Mu Dongqing was a scion from the Mu Family of Beijing—a prominent family that, although couldn’t be said to be at the top, but was also a middling prominent family. The Xiao Family, however, was very different. It was even more powerful than the Tang Family and could be ranked among the topmost prominent families. However, Xiao Chenglin himself was very low-key and humble, as he directly showed good will toward Tang Xiu.</p><p>The chat was merry and pleasant since everyone present was young, but the cooperation discussed with Qin Shaoyang yesterday was not mentioned in front of everyone.</p><p>As everyone was having lunch, Qin Shaoyang proposed, “How about going to the bowling alley and play some? Ah, right. The bowling alley is next to the swimming pool, too. You can go swimming if you don’t want to play bowling, and our best female swimming coach, Guo Tiantian, is also here today!”</p><p>Guo Tiantian?</p><p>Bai Tao’s eyes suddenly lit up.</p><p>Shortly after, everyone came to the bowling alley. There were only seven or eight people playing there, but there were a lot of pretty waiters around serving and pouring them tea and doing whatever services to their best. The most exaggerating scene was where a young girl was lying on a soft sofa while enjoying a massage from two attendants.</p><p>“Oh?” What was the most unexpected to Tang Xiu was that he saw two acquaintances in this bowling alley, his older cousin Tang Ying and his fake girlfriend, Mu Wanying. At this time, their arrival was also noticed by those seven people playing inside.</p><p>“Hola, sweetheart!”</p><p>Mu Wanying, who was watching Tang Ying playing with smiling face, suddenly turned dazed for a second upon seeing Tang Xiu among the newly arrived group, before immediately running over with a pleasantly surprised face.</p><p>“What…”</p><p>Except for Tang Xiu, everyone in the bowling alley was stunned with disbelief plastered on their faces when they looked at the excitedly surprised expression on Mu Wanying’s face as she ran over toward Tang Xiu.</p><p>Tang Xiu couldn’t help but sigh and groan inside. Mu Wanying’s expression and her address were really misleading others. However, he couldn’t explain the relationship between him and Mu Wanying in the presence of so many people either, and therefore could only force himself to let out a hollow smile, “You are playing here too, Wanying!”</p><p>There was some sweat on the tip of her nose, and the smile on her flawless face was extremely rich as she nodded and said, “Big Sis Tang Ying asked me to come out and play, so here we here. Never thought that I would see you here, though. It’s really great!”</p><p>“Wanying, what did you just call Tang Xiu?” Asked Mu Dongqing with a disbelieving expression.</p><p>Mu Wanying stared blankly, and then suddenly remembered that she had just called Tang Xiu ‘sweetheart’ and instantly blushed. Since she already said that she liked him in Shanghai, she subconsciously shouted without thinking because she was too pleasantly surprised. Now that it was heard by everyone, even jumping to the Yellow River would probably be unable to undo it.</p><p>Being unable to clear this up is fine, though! Yet she didn’t regret nor was perturbed by it, and even chuckled to herself inside instead. She then sneakily glanced at Tang Xiu with a bit of charming shyness.</p><p>The scene was seen by everyone, making them astounded.</p><p>That expression… wasn’t that admiration and shyness unintentionally shown by a girl to the boy she liked?! The First Belle of Beijing, the proudest princess of the Mu Family, actually fell in love with Tang Xiu? They… did they actually fell in love with each other?</p><p>All the youngsters who fantasized about Mu Wanying suddenly mourned inside. Had it been someone else, they may still have the confidence to fight and struggle, but the man was no one else but Tang Xiu. How could they still dare to fight?</p><p>Tang Ying took a white towel to wipe away her sweat and came to the front of the group with a strange expression. She shot Mu Wanying a look before shifting to Tang Xiu, and then suddenly nodded and said with satisfaction, “Well, well. Speaking about keeping the goodies within the family, it’s not bad. Brother, Grandma has been chattering away everyday, saying you must have a girlfriend and give her grandchildren to pick up earlier. Seems like grandma’s hopes are going to come true, eh. Anyways, you’re going to come with me to my ancestral home this evening, Wanying. The braised pork personally cooked by my grandma is very good and not greasy, definitely a delicious dish.”</p><p>“Ah…” Mu Wanying was dumbfounded, for she never dreamed that Tang Ying would say this. The shy look on her face immediately made her ears turn beet red.</p><p>Tang Xiu was also struck dumb, since he didn’t expect that Tang Ying would say that, and even invited Mu Wanying to visit their ancestral residence. If the latter really visited, his grandma would mistakenly regard her as her grandson’s wife to be...</p><p>“Sis Ying, Uncle called you a few times this morning, and your phone was off. I can tell that he’s kind of furious now! Why don’t you see uncle first?” Tang Xiu’s eyes rolled and immediately spoke.</p><p>With slightly wrinkled brows, a glint flashed in Tang Ying’s eyes. Her expression suddenly changed as she exclaimed, “Oh, God! Dad ordered to get the documents and I haven’t given them to him until now! Oh, I’m so dead! I’ll be definitely get scolded so badly this time. Anyways… I… I gotta go!”</p><p>After saying that, she went to get her bag.</p><p>After she ran for seven-plus steps, however, she suddenly came to halt and turned around with a strange expression on her face. She came back to the crowd, grabbed Mu Wanying’s hand, and grinningly said, “Well, there’s a sure-fire way to make Dad not blame me, though. And I’m hella sure he’ll praise me instead.”</p><p>With a strange expression, Tang Xiu asked, “What way?”</p><p>Tang Ying touched Mu Wanying’s flawless chin and spoke with a somewhat devious manner, “Well, if Dad knows that I helped my dearest, lovely cousin to chase after the First Belle of Beijing and become her boyfriend, tell me, will he still blame and be angry with me? Hahaha… this young lady is really smart, don’t you think? Wanying, let’s go. You’ll see my Grandma with me now.”</p><p>“I…” Stunned and dumbfounded, Mu Wanying was aware that despite her being so deeply in love with Tang Xiu, they were nothing but a fake couple. And this time, following Tang Ying to see his grandmother in the Tang Family… This… wasn’t this going to be courting some unforeseen mishaps?</p><p>Suddenly, Mu Wanying looked at Tang Xiu with an expression of pleading for help.</p><p>“Sis Ying, you…” Tang Xiu quickly stopped Tang Yin with a wry smile.</p><p>“What’s with me? You don’t want me to bring Wanying to see Grandma?” Tang Ying quickly interrupted him. “Do you think she’s not worthy to be with you? Or, are you holding back a trick or two, trying to get her into bed and then abandon her later?”</p><p>“I…” Tang Xiu opened his mouth and yet didn’t know what to reply.</p><p>Hmph… Tang Ying touched her chin and hummed before saying, “I tell you, brother. You too know my Dad’s temper, don’t you? This Big Sis of yours will surely die miserably if I have no good excuse this time. You don’t want to expose your relationship with Wanying for the time being, that I know. But please have a look at your Big Sis’s face, will you? You will agree with me, right? Aha… so be it then. Anyways, you must also come home tonight for dinner.”</p><p>Having said that, she grabbed Mu Wanying’s hand and ran away. Tang Xiu wanted to chase them, but in the presence of everyone else, he was unable to move his feet after all that Tang Ying said.</p><p>Ah, forget it. I’ll explain it to Grandma privately later!</p><p>Tang Xiu could only sigh secretly and felt a headache coming as he looked at the others in the surrounding. He just realized that everyone was looking at him like he was a monster or something.</p><p>“You guys… why are you all looking at me like that?”</p><p>“Brother Tang Xiu, there’s a good thing and a bad thing you need to hear,” said Bai Tao, grinning ear to ear. “Which one do you wanna hear first?”</p><p>“Nope. I don’t wanna hear it,” said Tang Xiu, giving him white eyes.</p><p>“You speak like that, but I’m hella sure you want to listen to it badly inside,” said Bai Tao with a grin. “Anyhow, I’m gonna tell you the good news first! The good news is that seeing that excited expression from the First Belle of Beijing, she really is in love with you! The bad news is… you have become the public enemy to all the young men in the entire Beijing for being their love rival. You must be very careful when you walk at night later!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
