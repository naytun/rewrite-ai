After getting all the way there, Jin Sanchi had finally suppressed the poison in his body and it would no longer threaten his life. As for Jin Sijie, he had taken the Holy Healing medicine and, despite his injury having yet to fully heal, his life was no longer in danger.</p><p>“Two Seniors, you are…”</p><p>Gesangjor wore a strange expression. Especially when he saw the miserable appearance of Jin Sijie and the bloodstains all over his body. He was about to speak out his mind but hesitated and stopped after letting out some words.</p><p>“We are fine,” said Jin Sanchi indifferently. “The reason we came here is that there are some things we need to ask you. As far as I know, the son of Sect Master of the Serenity Sect was killed along with Elegant Chess Saintess’ disciple here. What I want to know is, who exactly is the person who killed them?”</p><p>Gesangjor stared blankly and was secretly worried about Tang Xiu. Though he did not have much friendship with Tang Xiu, he liked his character and felt that the young man was a very capable person, and yet he too knew how terrifying these two people were.</p><p>Nowadays, the number of cultivators in the entire Strange Doors were far too few, while two or three of them were also disciples of Jin Sanchi and Jin Sijie. Therefore, their words were held in high esteem and held much weight in the Strange Doors, as they were also their biggest patron.</p><p>As a member of the Strange Doors himself, Gesangjor was someone who possessed authority over one of the parties under it. He naturally did not dare to hide anything and truthfully disclosed everything he knew about Tang Xiu. He then finally concluded, “What I know about him is only this much. But my old friend for many years, Jie Walie, might know more. I’ll go look for him if the two Seniors need to inquire more.”</p><p>“No, you don’t need to look for him.” Jin Sanchi waved his hand. “Knowing him as the young miracle-working doctor of Star City Chinese Medical Hospital in Shuangqing Province is a little clue in and of itself, and by following this clue, we can naturally find his real identity as well. Alright, we’ll be staying in your place to heal ourselves for a while. After the people from Strange Doors have left, you will be closing your hunting grounds for some time!”</p><p>“Junior will arrange everything as per your instructions,” said Gesangjor hastily.</p><p>After Gesangjor left the room, Jin Sanchi’s expression turned grim and gloomy. He did not speak for a long time and then said indifferently, “His identity as a Chinese medicine practitioner is definitely a disguise he intentionally uses to those in the outside to cover the real one. For him to be able to make Western Nefarious Sangha submit and become his Boss only means something: he’s not some a simple man! Furthermore, Gesangjor said that he brought eleven of his subordinates, and one of them killed the Justice Hall’s Master of the Serenity Sect. That kid had a fortuitous encounter and was a hair away from the final push to become a cultivator by virtue of his martial arts. For him to be killed by one of Tang Xiu’s men means that his subordinate is also a cultivator. Now, I’m suspecting that Tang Xiu is not only an itinerant cultivator but also someone from a large cultivaton sect.”</p><p>Jin Sijie frowned, “Where would such a large cultivator sect exist in today’s society? We, Brothers, also know that the number of cultivators in the entire China is probably not more than ten, right?”</p><p>“That is because we know nothing of the rest.” Jin Sanchi sneered and rebuked him. “There are more than a billion people in China, and Heavens knows how many cultivators and those who inherited Dao heritages are there. That Amur Tiger boy was buried in Beijing some time ago, and we don’t know who killed him. Do you think ordinary people can kill him?”</p><p>Jin Sijie’s expression moved and he immediately nodded without refuting it. “So, what do we do next? Tang Xiu is now occupying the Immortal Abode and its Immortal Trove and forced us to pay a heavy price. Don’t tell me we are just going to let it go like this?”</p><p>“… Let us wait and see first!”</p><p>Only then did Jin Sanchi replied helplessly after having been silent for a long time. “Western Nefarious Sangha occupied that Immortal Abode with Immortal Trove for so many years and yet he was still unable to open its entrance at all. Tang Xiu just learned about it, and he probably won’t be able to open its entrance either for the time being. The first thing we must do now is to treat our injuries and then find his real identity. We’ll scheme against him if he doesn’t have a formidable cultivator force behind him, but we have no other choice but to give this up if it is otherwise, and… we gotta try to be in good terms with him as much as possible.</p><p>“The Strange Door has suffered heavy losses. Should we give them some compensation?” Asked Jin Sijie.</p><p>“I thought about it on the way back and made up my mind. Those eight families and forces paid quite a disastrous price, thus they will be bitterly disappointed if we can’t pacify them, so let us just give them eight quotas!” Said Jin Sanchi. “And we should accept a few disciples.”</p><p>“But, the cultivation resources we have…”</p><p>Jin Sijie refuted quickly, but he could not finish his words as Jin Sanchi interrupted him with indifference, “I’m aware that cultivation resources we have now is scarce, so we cannot provide too many resources to foster disciples. But they are members of those eight families who want to train under us. Don’t tell me they don’t even have some resources? Those eight families must have amassed quite a lot of good things all these many years.”</p><p>“True that!” Jin Sijie nodded without refuting.</p><p>****</p><p>In the Immortal Abode, Longquan Bay.</p><p>Tang Xiu painstakingly studied the array of the Soul Tranquilizer Stone and solidified Dragon’s Eye on the ceiling of the cave, yet he could not find any clues whatsoever no matter how hard he tried. He even spent several days to refine a spirit tool and the spear to unleash a powerful might, yet he was still unable to destroy the array.</p><p>“No way to take it down, and neither can I destroy it.”</p><p>Tang Xiu stood in the middle of the cave with a long, distressed face. One must know that he was once a Supreme in the Immortal World and had an extremely deep knowledge and attainments in arrays. And yet, he had never seen nor heard of the strange arrangement of this array before.</p><p>“Forget it. I can only give up for now! But this place is indeed good. I cannot leave it unguarded.”</p><p>Tang Xiu went out of the cave. As he came outside and saw that Mo Awu’s group of eleven were cultivating there, he then ordered four of them to stay here, responsible for guarding the Immortal Trove. Following which, the then left with Mo Awu’s group of the remaining seven men quickly. There were a lot of things he had to do, and he could not waste his time staying here.</p><p>As he looked at the time, it was almost the day the Shanghai University started the new term, and he had not yet called Han Qingwu for a leave of absence. Although his relationship with Han Qingwu was better now, it was still not a justified excuse if he did not speak about it to her.</p><p>On the second day, Tang Xiu returned to Shanghai and phoned Han Qingwu to ask for a leave. Though he spent some effort, Han Qingwu finally gave consent and shortly after, he then headed for the research institute to hold a meeting with Mo Yi and wandered around the Institute for half of the day. When he saw that they were currently preparing for the following research, he contacted Kang Xia and instructed for two capable and trustworthy employees of the Magnificent Tang Corporation to come over.</p><p>During the busy days, Mu Qingping returned to Nine Dragons Island with Gu Yin, and Tang Xiaohan went with them. Tang Xiu originally wanted Tang Xiaohan to stay, but upon recalling that he often encountered various incidents and could not spare much time to take care of him, he also agreed with it.</p><p>****</p><p>South Gate Town.</p><p>As Tang Xiu returned from the outside and came to his parent’s place. The reason why he came back was that his mother, Su Lingyun, was ill. Though it was not a serious illness and she only had a cold and a fever, he hurried there first. He even did not spare the time to examine the power generator set that had just been delivered from abroad.</p><p>“I’m fine, Xiu’er. I just need to take some medicine and get some injections. I’ll be fine in a couple of days.” Su Lingyun was leaning on the bedhead. Her complexion was a bit pale and looked a bit wilted, but she forced out a smile and spoke after seeing Tang Xiu’s concerned face.</p><p>Tang Xiu gave her an examination and felt relieved upon finding that his mother had indeed only caught an ordinary cold and fever. He then immediately said with a smile, “Mom, did you forget my identity? The title of Star City Chinese Medical Hospital’s Young Divine Doctor is not blown out as flaunting for marketing. Rest assured, Mom! I’ll make a prescription for the medicine to get boiled for you to drink up. I guarantee that you will recover by tomorrow morning.”</p><p>“Alright.” Su Lingyun’s smiling face was a bit wider than just a moment ago.</p><p>Shortly after, Tang Xiu walked out of the room and saw that his father, Tang Yunde, just came out from the inside. His expression was a bit serious as he talked to him, “Dad, there are some things I want to talk to you about.”</p><p>Upon seeing the bit serious expression on his son’s face, Tang Yunde nodded and said, “Let’s go to the study room.”</p><p>In the study room.</p><p>Right as Tang Xiu took a seat, he spoke, “Dad, you too know that I’m a cultivator, and you must be perfectly aware what kind of existence a cultivator is. I’ve been considering all this while to impart a cultivation technique to you and Mom and helping you both to step on the cultivation path. But there have been many things to tend to, so I have not yet been able to realize it until now. So, I’m going to stay in Star City for some time to guide you and Mom in cultivation.”</p><p>There was a joyful expression on Tang Yunde’s face. But after pondering for a short while, he shook his head and said, “I don’t think it’s time yet. The most important thing for you in your Mom’s heart now is your studies. Staying in Star City to tend to your things may be very important to you, but I think the best thing you should do is to hurry up to get your things done here and then return to Shanghai. If you want to teach a cultivation technique to me and your Mom, wait for some time as I and your Mom will go to Shanghai and stay there for some time.”</p><p>“This…”</p><p>Tang Xiu somewhat hesitated. But then he felt that what his father said was correct and reasonable. He finally put away the idea and said, “Then I’ll teach some basic knowledge first. For example, the acupoints in the human body, meridians, and the cultivation technique’s contents. I will then fully assist you to step on the cultivation path once you come to Shanghai.”</p><p>“Alright!” This time, Tang Yunde did not refuse. He could feel the kindly intention inside his son’s heart, and he too knew that his son had a mature way of thinking. Having such a son not only made him fortunate, but also touched.</p><p>“Xiu’er, there’s something I need to tell you while you’re here.” Tang Yunde suddenly stopped him when Tang Xiu was about to leave the study room.</p><p>“What is it?” Asked Tang Xiu with a puzzled expression after turning around.</p><p>“Just write me that prescription and give it to me directly. I’ll get the medicines and boil them while you are going to the airport!” Tang Yunde smiled. “That girl, Wanying, said that she will arrive at Star City this evening, thus you will pick her up.”</p><p>Mu Wanying?</p><p>“What is she doing in Star City?” Asked Tang Xiu. “Doesn’t she currently have schooling to attend to at Shanghai University?”</p><p>The smile on Tang Yunde’s face looked mysterious when he answering, “Don’t ask so many questions, will you? In any case, change your clothes to something formal.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
