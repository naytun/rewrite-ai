He then recalled all the performances showcased by Tang Xiu previously and finally realized something: Tang Xiu’s identity was probably very extraordinary.</p><p>“Big Bro Tang, you are…” Yue Kai opened his mouth, but hesitated to continue.</p><p>Inwardly, Tang Xiu felt rather helpless. Chu Yuan praised him too lavishly in front of Yue Kai in a way that it was impossible for him to back down anymore. After hesitating for a moment, he also did not want to conceal it anymore and explained, “I’m the owner of the Magnificent Tang Corporation as well as the Everlasting Feast Hall. The money I have is probably more than people can imagine, to be honest. But money is nothing but mere worldly possessions in my eyes. Regardless of whatever identity each one of us has, we are brothers of the same kindred spirits.”</p><p>Yue Kai looked a bit astonished. He did not know what to say all of a sudden upon seeing how tranquil Tang Xiu’s expression was. On the other hand, Wu Guanghui nearby was unable to restrain his body trying not to shiver, as a horrified expression burst out from his eyes.</p><p>The Magnificent Tang Corporation and the Everlasting Feast Hall?</p><p>The Everlasting Feast Hall was one of the best high-end restaurants in Shanghai, and Wu Guanghui also knew that it was not its main office, but only a branch. He would not have been this shocked if it was only this restaurant franchise, but the reputation of the Magnificent Tang Corporation was too astounding for him.</p><p>In particular, he just heard his father speaking to him a few days ago that the Magnificent Tang Corporation just bought a large plot of land in Shanghai and was preparing to build its HQ as well as an industrial park. Nearly all the top 20 construction companies in the country received an invitation from this company, of which the tender would be held soon.</p><p>His family owned the Myriad Construction Group, and it could only be ranked as a mid-sized construction company in the country, thus not eligible to participate in the construction project tender held by the Magnificent Tang Corporation. But his father also said that if it worked well, they could cooperate with the company that won the bid and that they could make a fortune even if they only got some soup!</p><p>Pa…</p><p>Wu Guanghui suddenly slapped his own face, and his unbridled and arrogant manner had completely vanished. Instead, he looked full of remorse and regret as he said, “Tang… Boss Tang, I was just muddle headed and failed to recognize a great man such as you before. Please do not stoop down to my level if I have offended you.”</p><p>“Okay, just hurry up and continue having fun with your girls!” Tang Xiu waved his hand in disgust. “Don’t make a fool of yourself here.”</p><p>At this very moment, Xie Xiaotong, who just caught up, was stunned, for she had never dreamed that Tang Xiu turned out to be the Big Boss of the Magnificent Tang Corporation and also seemed to have other industries other than this company as well. She recalled herself ridiculing and insulting him a while ago. Her whole being suddenly turned tense and restless, and the regret made her feel like dying.</p><p>She just compared them and suddenly found that Wu Guanghui, who was already very outstanding in the eyes of many people, was far worse than Tang Xiu. The latter was self-employed and built his own enterprise, and became the true owner of such a major company, while the former was only a scion of a rich family—a second generation nouveau riche, and a playboy silk pants.</p><p>Pa…</p><p>Suddenly, a slap hit her face. And the one who did that was Wu Guanghui.</p><p>Wu Guanghui rolled up his sleeves and, after slapping Xie Xiaotong’s face, he pointed at her and cursed furiously, “IT WAS BECAUSE OF YOU, BITCH! YOU’RE THE ONE WHO SEDUCED ME! Had I known you and this Yue… Mr. Yue knew each other, how the hell would I dare to even touch you? Get the hell out of here! And don’t let me see you again later.”</p><p>Xie Xiaotong looked dull after getting slapped. Never did she expect that this guy would slap her all of a sudden and make her a scapegoat as if all his mistakes were all caused by her.</p><p>She felt humiliated, and yet, the regret she felt was even more!</p><p>She admitted that she was not a good woman, but little did she think that het flattery would lead to this situation. At this moment, she suddenly felt that her stupidity was already beyond limits, for her snobbishness was nothing but making her a plaything for men… a slut.</p><p>BITCH!</p><p>The vocabulary replayed inside her mind, and Xie Xiaotong’s heart was like being pierced by needles—painful. Her face was instantly devoid of color. She did not fight back nor did she get angry. She was as though she had lost her soul as she staggeringly walked away, carried by her footsteps.</p><p>Tang Xiu calmly watched as the scene unfolded. He had not the slightest sympathy for Xie Xiaotong. For one to be pitied, she or he must have a detestable side, and yet, she was the one who brought disaster upon herself for the situation and consequences of today’s incident. He was also disgusted by Wu Guanghui and did not want to even look at him again, saying, “Chu Yuan, are you going to continue strolling around? Or…”</p><p>Without waiting for Chu Yuan to answer, Xue Yu straightforwardly spoke, “No, we won’t go shopping together. I’m going with you.”</p><p>Chu Yuan opened his mouth and a forced, wry smile appeared on his handsome face. He then shook his head and sighed, “It’s as people said, that a woman who has gone out to marry a man is truly like something that has been lost and cannot be retrieved. Anyways, Jade Beauty is paying more attention to her lover than her friend, then I’ll go back first. Tang Xiu, remember your promise to drink with me some other day.”</p><p>Tang Xiu smiled at him and nodded with eyes following Chu Yuan’s departure.</p><p>At this time, Yue Kai had a complicated mood. He looked at the beautiful Xue Yu beside Tang Xiu and then looked at the latter and spoke, “About your things… do you still need my help?”</p><p>Tang Xiu scrunched up for a moment before shaking his head and saying, “Seems like we gotta forget it. You are not in the mood, and since I met Xue Yu here, I’ll take her to accompany me!”</p><p>“Okay, then!” Yue Kai was indeed not in the mood right now and nodded happily. Just as he walked away for a few steps, he suddenly recalled something and his pace came to a halt. He then turned around and asked loudly, “Big Bro Tang, are the clothes you wanna buy for her?”</p><p>“No!” Tang Xiu shook his head.</p><p>“HOLY FUCK!”</p><p>Yue Kai’s heart was as good as dead at this time. The comparison between them was pretty much odious, and his spirit was thoroughly dying. He had seen too many Casanovas, yet never seen such an amazing expert who could outspokenly say to buy clothes for another woman with his lover.</p><p>“Your money.”</p><p>The female cashier from the Hermes exclusive store had yet to leave, so she witnessed the entire farce from the beginning to the end. She was extremely disgusted by Wu Guanghui and despised him, and even held Xie Xiaotong in an unusual contempt since she felt that she was a disgrace to all women.</p><p>Nevertheless, she did sympathize with Yue Kai at first, but felt happy for him afterward. Although she never expected that the Big Boss of the Magnificent Tang Corporation turned out to be just a handsome young man, but for Yue Kai to have such a brother was definitely a good karma that was sowed after having been cultivated for several generations.</p><p>What is the so-called brotherhood?</p><p>This Big Boss of the Magnificent Tang Corporation had spoken this, that it was something that the thought of the people involved in the bond that matter. Brothers would not bother mentioning wealth and money. Either being rich or destitute, brothers were brothers. So what this was called? This was the so-called genuine nature of what a real man!</p><p>Yue Kai was taken aback and looked back to at Tang Xiu again, only to find that Tang Xiu just waved at him and brought Xue Yu away.</p><p>“Just take the money! What has been given to someone is something one cannot take back. Taking it back will only mean that person is shameless. If anything, it was Big Bro Tang who actually gave me the money. Besides, he’s a super rich guy, so you should not take it seriously.”</p><p>Finding that Yue Kai was going to leave, the female cashier quickly blocked his path, shook her head and said, “No, a gentleman must never hand out a meal in contempt, and this is not my money either. I already told you that I don’t want it. Besides, I don’t think your brother is likely someone to owe money. It was you who did not have enough money to pick up a girl and borrowed it from him, right? Anyhow, I’ve been wanting to speak to you about this before, but I held back since we’re just strangers. But now, I can’t think that much anymore.”</p><p>“Pretending to be a scion from a wealthy family with others’ money won’t make you a real man. You’re still young, so it is the time for you to study or start a business. It doesn’t matter if you don’t have money now. Just don’t seek enjoyment and pleasure at first and wait until you earn enough money. Like those two women just now, they definitely cost you a great deal.</p><p>“Thus, I ask you to take this money back.”</p><p>Again, Yue Kai was taken aback. He looked at this female cashier in disbelief and felt his face burning. He had just gotten humiliated by Wu Guanghui and it was already quite a grievous blow to him. To think that even an attendant was now looking down on him, a nefarious flame was immediately set ablaze inside his heart. He reached out to grab the 30 thousand yuan and stuffed it into her pocket, and then grabbed her hand and strode towards the store.</p><p>After entering, Yue Kai released the struggling female cashier’s hand. He then picked the nearest four Hermes bags and directly dropped them on the checkout counter. Then, he took out a credit card and spoke in a heavy tone, “Swipe this card. I’ll buy these four bags.”</p><p>The female cashier looked stunned, and then her expression turned into that of surprise, Did I just misread him? Didn’t he borrow the money to pick up that girl? Is he really rich?</p><p>Countless question marks fluttered around in her head. She hesitated for a short while, as she forced out a wry smile and said, “If what I spoke to you wrong, I beg you to forgive me and not to be offended by my ignorance. Please don’t be angry and try to prove yourself in front of me. There’s no need for you to buy those four bags all at once. You must know that the total price of these four bags is 110 thousand yuan.”</p><p>“I told you to swipe the card!” Said Yue Kai with a sullen face.</p><p>“You…”</p><p>The female cashier opened her mouth, only to find that Yue Kai did not even wanted to hear it. She suddenly felt annoyed and turned the label directly. After registering and calculating the price, she said, “The total amount of these four bags is 118 thousand yuan. Are you sure you’re going to pay them with your credit card?”</p><p>“Swipe it!” Said Yue Kai adamantly.</p><p>However angry and irritated she may be, the female cashier still hesitated and looked at Yue Kai again. After finding out that his face was cold and gloomy, only then did she pick up the credit card and swiped it. As the bill was printed out, only then did she realize that she had really misunderstood Yue Kai. A customer who spent 118 thousand yuan meant that the person did not even need to borrow money from others.</p><p>Yue Kai shot her a deep look before he turned around and left.</p><p>The female cashier was speechless due to astonishment. The four bags were still on the checkout counter, and he just left like that? After a short blank, she hurriedly called out, “Sir, you haven’t taken your bags!”</p><p>Yue Kai did not even look back as he replied, “I’m in a bad mood today. I’m not even allowed to play with money and throw it out? You can take all those bags if you want. Or throw them out if you don’t.”</p><p>“I…”</p><p>The female cashier was as though zapped by thunder. Her whole being turned silly and she stood still in her spot with a blank expression. Her several colleagues around could only cast envious looks at her. She did not even remember that Yue Kai had also returned that 30 thousand yuan to her a while ago. Ultimately, in just a short few minutes, four Hermes bags with a total price of 118 thousand yuan were gifted to her.</p><p>“What’s wrong with everything going on today?</p><p>“Did I just run into a good-for-nothing? Or did I just bump a silly, rich local guy?</p><p>“And these four bags…”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
