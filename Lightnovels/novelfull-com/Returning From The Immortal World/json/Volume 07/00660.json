Never once had they ever thought that Tang Xiu could have such a queer cultivation technique. This Golden Armored Zombie’s current strength was already very terrifying. If he was to practice that cultivation technique, how powerful would he be in the future?</p><p>Wasn’t this akin to raising a tiger only to court a disaster upon yourself in the future?</p><p>Though they were very concerned about it inwardly; however, they did not have any courage to object at all. They could only exchange looks with forced, bitter smiles in silence.</p><p>When they landed on the ground, Tang Xiu straightly said, “Golden Armored Zombie, you also know that the Western Nefarious Sangha is very strong, thus I request that you to stay with us for the time being so that you can see him be killed by our hands.”</p><p>“This… alright.” Golden Armored Zombie hesitated for a moment before complying. Though he had gained sentience and wisdom many years ago, his ability in scheming and trickery was always inferior to the humans’. He could not see through Tang Xiu’s true intentions at all.</p><p>Tang Xiu requested for him to stay with them, on the one hand, was because he was afraid that he would secretly notify Western Nefarious Sangha that he planned to kill him. On the other hand, he wanted to display a show of force, to make the Golden Armored Zombie see how much power he had. On the way back to Longquan Village, Tang Xiu phoned Gu Xiaoxue and told her that he wanted Light and Dark to come over as fast as possible.</p><p>Tang Xiu didn’t plan to bring Miao Wentang and Shao Mingzhen to kill the Western Nefarious Sangha, because he could judge from their words and behavior that they had yet to recognize that the swords in the hands of Mo Awu’s group were flying swords. He had inquired Mo awu about this matter in secret and learned that when Mo Awu and the rest released their flying swords, Miao Wentang and Shao Mingzhen were in an intense combat with Western Nefarious Sangha, and the subordinates of the two men should have not noticed their actions when they released their flying swords.</p><p>In the courtyard.</p><p>Tang Xiu could see Miao Wentang’s and Shao Mingzhen’s faces, wanting to speak but hesitating. After pondering about it, he could understand what they had in mind and slightly smiled, “Two Brothers, I know what’s making you concerned and worried. Western Nefarious Sangha is someone who stops nothing in doing all sorts of evil, and he has probably been a disaster for the ordinary people as well. Even if there was no incident this time, I would still try to exterminate him. However, our present strength is not enough, and our chance of killing him is very slim even if we are to join forces.”</p><p>“Then, what’s your plan?” Asked Miao Wentang quickly.</p><p>“I’m looking for people to help us,” answered Tang Xiu.</p><p>“Who?” Asked Miao Wentang, looking confused.</p><p>“I know that you two are curious, Brothers.” Tang Xiu smiled. “But it’s not yet the time to tell you. We must kill Western Nefarious Sangha, but you two cannot participate in this. The people I invited have a very strange temper, they don’t want to communicate with any strangers. Just wait for a couple of days, and then I promise to show you the result a few days later.”</p><p>Upon hearing this, Miao Wentang and Shao Mingzhen had no choice but suppress their curiosity and no longer asked about this matter. Tang Xiu was very thorough and methodical in doing things, something they were perfectly aware of, thus it made them feel reassured. Although they aware that Tang Xiu said that “Western Nefarious Sangha was someone who had done all sorts of evil things” as a kind of excuse, yet they did not say much about it.</p><p>Two days later.</p><p>Tang Xiu left Longquan Village with Golden Armored Zombie. Just as he drove the car out of the village, two figures silently appeared.</p><p>“Brother Miao, seems like what we know about Brother Tang is still too little, sigh!” Sighed Shao Mingzhen with a forced smile.</p><p>“I already thought that he was very mysterious back when we first met him in the Everlasting Feast Hall.” Miao Wentang nodded. “Though I’ve always been wanting to unveil all his secrets, he kinda gives me a feeling that I won’t be able to do so. Needless to say about that though, speaking about his strength, isn’t now only more than half a year from then? Yet his cultivation progressed so rapidly that he now has unexpectedly surpassed us. This is simply unfathomable!”</p><p>Shao Mingzhen nodded and said, “Yeah! The methods he showcased when he combated Golden Armored Zombie, especially those two spells—it’s like the forbidden art we used… No, it’s wrong. We’re probably unable to unleash such a might even if we use our forbidden arts.”</p><p>Miao Wentang was silent for a while. He then patted Shao Mingzhen’s shoulder and firmly said, “Everyone has secrets, and since Tang Xiu is unwilling to tell, let us not inquire deeper into it. Shortly put, we must get closer to him in the future, then I’m sure we can get many benefits from him too.”</p><p>“Copy that!” Shao Mingzhen firmly nodded.</p><p>About a dozen kilometers from Longquan Village, an off-road car was parked on a dirt road. Mo Awu stayed on the driver seat and did not get off the car, whereas Light and Dark were standing in front.</p><p>“Grand Master!” Light and Dark cupped their fists and reverentially called out.</p><p>Tang Xiu nodded with a happy expression and glanced at Golden Armored Zombie nearby, whose stance was on guard against enemies, and faintly said, “They are my juniors, so you don’t have to show such an appearance. Though you have been cultivating the cultivation technique from Corpse Smelting Lineage over these two days and the small result you obtained faintly improved your strength, these two can easily kill you if they join forces.”</p><p>Golden Armored Zombie nodded with a cautious expression and said, “They are indeed very strong. I can feel a terrifying force hidden inside their bodies.”</p><p>“Anyways, let’s go! To look for Western Nefarious Sangha,” said Tang Xiu with a slight smile.</p><p>“Can you really not spare him?” Golden Armored Zombie looked hesitant. “Immortal Master, you don’t see me as a zombie yet you can do that to me, but why can’t you give him a chance to forsake his evil ways and return to the right path? I’m sure that if he faces the choice between death or submitting, he will definitely choose the latter.”</p><p>Tang Xiu squinted his eyes and said with indifference, “Judging from Wester Nefarious Sangha’s character, I’m afraid that it won’t be so easy to make him submit. Even if he does choose to submit, it would be nothing but a temporarily retreat, and it will be highly like that he will betray me in the future. Thus, the best choice I can think of is to weed out the roots and stamp out the source of trouble.”</p><p>“Immortal Master, Western Nefarious Sangha actually has small courage. Though he often does shameless things, if you show him absolute strength or methods to destroy his trump cars, I’m sure he won’t dare to betray you.”</p><p>“He’s a timid man?” Tang Xiu’s face was strange as he looked at Golden Armored Zombie in surprise. He could tell that this zombie did not seem to be lying to him.</p><p>“We’ll see!” Replied Tang Xiu lightly and went straight back to the car.</p><p>The two SUVs then quickly drove toward the Western Nefarious Sangha’s nest. From here to the destination was still a dozen miles away, and because there was no road ahead, Mo Awu stayed behind to guard the cars while Tang Xiu led Light and Dark flying toward the destination with Golden Armored Zombie.</p><p>Longquan Swamp. It was a quiet place in the deep valley surrounded by mountains on the four sides. The lowest elevation of the four peaks was about 500 to 600 meters high, whereas the highest mountain peak was nearly a kilometer, and Western Nefarious Sangha’s Immortal Abode was located exactly on the mountain pathway halfway to the highest peak. When the four people landed on the flat ground in front of the entrance of his Immortal Abode, Tang Xiu sighed, “This is really a good place to seclude yourself from the world. There’s also a spiritual vein here that’s simply a blessed land for cultivators.”</p><p>Golden Armored Zombie then whispered, “I have never been inside. Western Nefarious Sangha is a very cautious man, and he usually meets me here outside. He once told me that he has set up layers of traps in his Immortal Abode, and said that my chance to survive would be not more than 30% if I were to rashly intrude inside.”</p><p>Tang Xiu pricked his brows up. He flicked his arms and released the Bloodguzzler Dagger and bombarded it onto the leafy wooden door. As the sawdust splashed and scattered around, he had already stepped into the cave’s door.</p><p>“Destroy!”</p><p>Tang Xiu took two Lightning Symbols and two Raging Flame Symbols at the same time and the spell flashed through the passage in front. Inside the 100-meters-long passage, all sorts of traps were completely ruined and an extremely simple defensive array was shattered, creating a loud noise.</p><p>“Who are you?”</p><p>At the depths of the hundreds of meters cave, there was a space at the size of a regular football field with various carved stones and statues standing erect. Under the illumination of various lights, the place was so imaginary and illusory that it felt like a dream. A small stream ran through the space of the cave and flowed through it, unknown where its destination was.</p><p>“Interesting! He’s even using generators to generate electricity here.”</p><p>Tang Xiu cast a glance toward the inside of Western Nefarious Sangha’s cave. And his eyes then moved to the scenery illuminated by the lanterns inside the cave. When he saw the ground about ten meters deep below, he actually found twelve beautifully carved stone statues, making his eyes instantly squint.</p><p>“Using these stone statues to lay out an array, and the method used is much more profound than the defensive array outside. The might it possesses seems to be much bigger as well. Well, this Western Nefarious Sangha does have some abilities, eh?” Tang Xiu secretly thought to himself.</p><p>Western Nefarious Sangha took the lying magic wand and bolted toward Tang Xiu and the others like a sharp sword. After he clearly saw them, his face drastically changed. He glared at Golden Armored Zombie and shouted, “Did you bring them here? Are you betraying me?”</p><p>“You should have heard the saying that one must bow their heads under the eaves, right, Western Nefarious Sangha?” Tang Xiu smiled. “Golden Armored Zombie didn’t want to die, so he told me everything I wanted to know. Of course, he also paid a price, like that Aerolite Essence he gave me.”</p><p>“WHO THE HELL ARE YOU?” Growled Western Nefarious Sangha.</p><p>“Who I am is not important. But the fact that you have discovered some of my secrets is what is important. So, you must die,” said Tang Xiu.</p><p>When Western Nefarious Sangha thought better about it, he then realized as to what secrets Tang Xiu was mentioning. Tang Xiu’s personal strength was very strong, and it seemed that Light who followed behind him was not weak either. They were able to defeat Golden Armored Zombie, thus they were highly likely to be able to do the same to him. Though he had a deadly trump card, yet it was hard to say who would live or die.</p><p>“I’ll give you the Aerolite Essence and I’ll swear to keep your secrets in the dark, but all the grievances between us will be written off. How about it?”</p><p>“It seems that Golden Armored Zombie was right. You’re timid and cowardly.” Tang Xiu shook his head. “However, you’re the Western Nefarious Sangha, who would believe your vow or words, huh? In my eyes, only dead men tell no tales, then no secrets would be revealed for eternity.”</p><p>Just as Tang Xiu’s voice faded away, Light, donned in a white attire, had appeared in front of Western Nefarious Sangha in an instant, and his flying sword was instantly brandished, as layers of sword images emerged out of thin air and enveloped the bald monk from every direction. Each of these sword images was full of a swift and sharp aura.</p><p>“BREAK!”</p><p>Western Nefarious Sangha waved the magic wand in his hand down, and the wand’s shadows created layers of black mist to billow out and strangle the sword images. At the same time, his other hand patted the sackcloth on his waist and suddenly, two balls of flames blazed out and then transformed into two Bloodthirsty Chiropterans the size of a Northern Goshawk.</p><p>Whoosh. Whoosh…</p><p>Two Bloodthirsty Chiropterans swayed their wings as a sea of flames boiled the air.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
