Just as A’ Qiang pointed the gun at him, his eyes seemed to see a dead person.</p><p>“Do you really want to compare it?” Asked Tang Xiu with an indifferent smile.</p><p>Killing intention surged inside A’ Qiang’s eyes. Though the indifference displayed by Tang Xiu made him hesitant and afraid, yet he would never hesitate to shoot since he knew that all humans, including himself, only had one life.</p><p>Life has a funny way of giving back what you put out, as one will have to pay for what they had done sooner and later!</p><p>He was fully aware of what this sentence meant and had made his own preparation many years ago. However, he still had the Du Family as his backer and would come out safe and sound; unless the Du Family didn’t want to shelter him anymore. In that unlikely case, he could still hit the road and ran away. He had left a way out for himself a few years ago and could go abroad if worse came to worst.</p><p>At the side, the moment when A’ Qiang pulled his pistol out, Huang Xu’s eyes contracted violently and he hesitated for a moment. But then, he strode forward and stopped in front of Tang Xiu, blocking A’ Qiang and shouting at him, “If you dare to shoot, then kill me first. Else put your gun down!”</p><p>A’ Qiang was taken aback. He never dreamed that the young master of the Huang Family—Huang Xu would actually come forward to shield Tang Xiu. He knew perfectly well how powerful the Huang Family in Shuangqing Province was, as even the Du Family never wanted to provoke them. If he shot him, it was highly likely that the Du Family wouldn’t be able to shelter him, and he would be butchered by the Huang Family’s people if he stayed in Blue City.</p><p>A smile outlined the corner of Tang Xiu’s mouth. While that smile climbed up his face, he patted Huang Xu’s shoulder and said, “Huang Xu, I accept your good intentions, but let me solve this matter myself! He’s a nobody, no need for you to be troubled by him.”</p><p>As his voice faded away, his figure that was originally behind Huang Xu instantly disappeared. When he reappeared again, his fingers had already pinched A’ Qiang’s wrist, and the latter dropped the gun the moment Tang Xiu’s fist punched his forehead. A’ Qiang’s nose caved in and his facial bones shattered, with blood flowing out from his eyes. The man then collapsed on the floor.</p><p>A violent death with a single punch!</p><p>Tang Xiu casually kicked A’ Qiang’s dead body and sent him to the corner of the wall. Then, he slowly returned to the sofa. After taking a seat, he smiled and said, “I didn’t expect that I would have to kill someone, but since I already killed him then so be it! Young Master Du, right? Now, please continue with the phone call to summon your people. We can opt to go outside if you can’t bring them here. I myself don’t mind booking this Clearlake Club for us to continue. Besides, it’s quite spacious outside, big enough for us to play.”</p><p>Du Yunjie violently shivered and felt the shadow of death looming over his heart, making him wish to run away at this moment. Unbridled, wild, and arrogant he may be, but that was on the premise that he didn’t bump into tough, ruthless, and merciless people. But at this time, the Tang Xiu in front of him was too powerful, as he was even able to deal with more than a dozen ruthless and strong thugs from Blue City’s underworld society all by himself. The most notable fact was that he dared to kill openly and straightforwardly?</p><p>“You…”</p><p>He looked at A’ Qiang’s dead body, and the panicked expression on his face was particularly evident. Running away was not something he dared to do; making a phone call to pray for help to come, the savior hadn’t yet arrived. He was afraid that Tang Xiu would change his mind and kill him before his big brother arrived.</p><p>Huang Xu knew that today’s matter was doomed to become big when Tang Xiu killed A’ Qiang. Out of rage, he glared at the paralyzed Du Yunjie, who was out of his wits, and then looked at Long Zhengyu, plea on his eyes. He knew the relationship between him and Tang Xiu, and the only person who was probably able to calm Tang Xiu down at this time was none other but him.</p><p>Long Zhengyu was taciturn for a while before he suddenly shook his head and smilingly spoke, “Tang Xiu, let’s just wait for someone from the Du Family to come over! If they lower their heads to apologize, let’s conclude this matter and forget it. But if they don’t, then let’s have some more fun.”</p><p>“Are you getting soft?” Asked Tang Xiu with a smile.</p><p>“Nope, nothing like that.” Long Zhengyu shook his head. “It’s just that our original intention was to play in Blue City. There’s no need to create more trouble; though we don’t fear trouble ourselves. But having fewer incidents is much better than more, nonetheless. Rather than waste time on fighting and killing, it’s better to sit with some friends to eat and drink.”</p><p>“Makes sense to me.” Tang Xiu couldn’t help laughing.</p><p>“True that. True that.” Huang Xu echoed quickly. “I have nothing here but tons of good wine and meat to spice things up. Or, how about I arrange this for you in advance? When someone from the Du Family comes here and expressly discuss this matter, everything will be finished.”</p><p>“No hurry. I don’t think this matter can be done easily.” Tang Xiu slightly smiled. “I’m afraid I won’t let this matter go as long as the Du Family wants their face still intact. We’ll wait here! Someone will probably come soon.”</p><p>Immediately, the atmosphere inside the Seacraft Hall froze. Except for those stocky men who were badly beaten and were lying around Du Yanjie, Huang Xu and Wang Zidong had bitter smiles plastered on their faces, as they didn’t know whether they had to sit or stand, feeling on edge and uneasy.</p><p>“I… let me go out and have a look first.” After getting stunned for a period of time, Wang Zidong braved himself to speak.</p><p>Tang Xiu glanced at him and said, “Going out to take a look is fine, but don’t talk too much!”</p><p>Wang Zidong himself had just decided that he would tell Du Yunlong about Tang Xiu’s identity after the man had arrived here. But when he heard Tang Xiu’s warning, he immediately tossed this thought away. He was not afraid of the Du Family, what he feared was Du Yunlong. But if he were to compare him with Tang Xiu, he was definitely more afraid of Tang Xiu.</p><p>After going out, Wang Zidong saw Li Chunlei waiting in the corridor outside and said with a bitter smile, “Send instructions to clean up the Supreme Hall and prepare good wine and dishes. Also, take the best tea leaves in my room to the Supreme Hall as well, it will be used later.”</p><p>Inside, Li Chunlei was shocked. Though he had long guessed that Long Zengyu and Tang Xiu had extraordinary identities, little did he think that they would receive such attention and care. One must know that the guests who could use the Supreme Hall in Blue City were probably less than the number of fingers in both of his hands.</p><p>“I’ll arrange it now!”</p><p>Wang Zidong watched as he left. He fell into silence for a short while before clenching his teeth, typing a text and sending it.</p><p>On a road a dozen kilometers away, two cars were heading toward the direction of the Clearlake Club. Inside one of the Mercedes-Benz, Du Yunlong’s mobile phone vibrated. After he took it out and read the text message, his face slightly changed.</p><p>“Master, A’ Qiang is dead.” Du Yunlong turned his head and looked at the middle-aged man sitting beside him.</p><p>Shao Mingzhen slightly furrowed his brows. Pity could be seen on his face as he lightly said, “I originally wanted to enter Blue City secretly by subduing A’ Qiang and using him as my proxy. I didn’t expect him to die. Wasn’t he sheltered by your Du Family? Don’t tell me he provoked a terrifying figure?”</p><p>“I don’t know, either.” Du Yunlong shook his head. “Just before I received a text that you’re at the airport, I had been informed that my little brother has stirred up trouble in the Clearlake Club. He should be the one who called A’ Qiang, so…”</p><p>“You two are biological brothers from the Du Family, yet have such different characters.” Shao Mingzhen narrowed his eyes. “You have great aim, great ambition, a steady and safe attitude in pursuing something, and a low-key disposition. Yet Du Yunjie is unbridled and seriously have a silk pants’ bad habits. I’m afraid he will be in for getting stabbed and stuffed into a big basket in the future if your family can’t properly restrain him.”</p><p>“My parents are too fond of him, thus they spoiled him,” said Du Yunlong helplessly. “Though I have tried to keep him in check, I don’t have other means to change his slovenly, reckless attitude completely. How about you find some time to teach him well, Master? I believe that he will definitely grow a lot if you are willing to teach him.”</p><p>“We’ll discuss this matter some other time!” said Shao Mingzhen faintly. “I still have a lot of things to deal with, and though there’s no need for me to involve myself with the matters in Star City, the expansion I planned in the dark is kind of obstructed. If there’s no other way around to break into Blue City, it won’t be easy to expand my influence in other provinces than Shuangqing Province.”</p><p>“But Master, there are many families in Blue City, and some of them even have a deeper heritage as well as an intricate network,” hesitantly said Du Yunlong. “If you want to control the underworld forces in Blue City, I’m afraid that it won’t be easy to counter the resistance from those families without the support from some big shots in the government.”</p><p>“I’m not unaware of this fact.” Shao Mingzhen nodded “I wanted to control A’ Qiang, who could be said as someone discovered by your family. I want to exercise control over dozens of powerful people in the entire Blue City, but I’m aware that more than that may possibly give rise to the anger of the families, joining in opposition to battle the same adversary. However, I have no other options. There are reasons behind my actions.”</p><p>Du Yunlong was very confused and puzzled. He couldn’t figure out why his Master wanted to control the underground forces in Blue City. Even if he wanted to be the Godfather of the entire Shuangqing Province, it didn’t mean that Blue City was the only place he could start at. He really wanted to ask him, but was evaded by his Master every time, and therefore could only bury his confusion inside.</p><p>“Master, I just broke through the Foundation Establishment Stage a couple days ago.” Du Yunlong changed the subject and spoke in an undertone voice.</p><p>Shao Mingzhen’s eyes lit up and nodded with satisfaction. He had two disciples being an itinerant cultivator. His first disciple had been living in a foreign country and only returned to China every year to celebrate New Year, whereas his second disciple had always been in the country and followed him for at least a few months every year for cultivation purposes.</p><p>Originally, he thought that his second disciple would require at least a few years more before he breakthrough to the Foundation Establishment Stage. Little did he expect that his aptitude turned out to be this good and had already had a breakthrough now.</p><p>“That’s great, you’re very good.” Shao Mingzhen nodded and praised. “Maybe you can surpass your First Martial Brother and break through to the Golden Core Stage earlier than him.”</p><p>“As a matter of fact, this disciple chanced upon a good opportunity,” said Du Yunlong with a smile. “I met someone, a authoritative figure in the Endless Virtue Pharmaceutical in Blue City. I bought several precious medicinal herbs from him, and after a period of having nourishing medicated dishes, I then broke through to the Foundation Establishment Stage.</p><p>“You mean, someone in charge of the Endless Virtue Pharmaceutical in Blue City sold it to you in secret?” Shao Mingzhen was surprised.</p><p>“Yeah, he often keeps some precious medicinal herbs.” Du Yunlong nodded. “I can help you contact him if you need them.”</p><p>“I had better let it pass!” Shao Mingzhen shook his head. “I’m afraid that things will go awry if Chen Zhizhong learns about this.”</p><p>“But Master, why do you still pay attention to Chen Zhizhong given your present capacity?” Du Yunlong’s brows raised.</p><p>With a forced smile, Shao Mingzhen said, “It’s not him who I look at, but his Master! Well, let’s forget it! Anyways, since you always wanted to know why I want to control the underground forces in the entire Shuangqing Province, especially here in Blue City, then I’ll tell you about it today.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
