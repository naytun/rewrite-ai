Although he had long guessed that Tang Xiu had an extraordinary identity, there was not the slightest aura of a silk pants young master from him despite still being young. This left him with high regards for the young man. He couldn’t help recalling the rampant and arrogant Du Yunjie. Contrasting him with Tang Xiu, they were simply worlds apart.</p><p>“Thank you, thank you very much, Sir,” said Li Chunlei with gratitude.</p><p>Tang Xiu only let out a faint smile in response as he pulled the somewhat reluctant Long Zhengyu out of Seacraft Hall’s door. It was not his character to haggle over small things, and eating a meal was just the same. Furthermore, he did hear what the other party said: 50% discount!!!</p><p>In the corridor outside, Du Yunjie and several other young men slowly came in. The grim expression on Du Yunje’s face disappeared a bit when he saw Tang Xiu and Long Zhengyu coming out of Seacraft Hall. As he saw Li Chunlei walking out, he stepped forward and, while pointing at Tang Xiu and Long Zhengyu, who just walked past them, said, “All our expenses tonight will be on them!”</p><p>Li Chunlei froze. He frowned and said, “Young Master Du, isn’t it inappropriate for you to say that? These two guests have been quite amiable since they are willing to give you the Seacraft Hall, but I hope you don’t demand a foot after getting an inch from them. After all, our Clearlake Club is not your general public place, to begin with.”</p><p>“They just occupied my box, what should be the problem with them paying it up for me after checking out? Do you want to use Huang Xu to pressure me?” Sneered Du Yunjie.</p><p>“Young Master Du, you’re someone of big status, a nobody like me can’t afford to offend you.” Li Chunlei said. “You were using this Seacraft Hall before, thus it has nothing to do with me as for who must pay the bill. It will be my Boss who will decide that after he arrives.”</p><p>Du Yunjie sneered and entered the Seacraft Hall.</p><p>At this moment, however, Tang Xiu and Long Zhengyu, who had stopped their pace, could clearly hear the conversation between Du Yanjie and Li Chunlei.</p><p>“Wait a minute!”</p><p>As Long Zhengyu turned around, a cold expression could be seen on his handsome face as he said succinctly, “We can pay the bill for your expenses in the Seacraft Hall, but I don’t know whether you can pay the price of enjoying it.”</p><p>Stunned, Du Yunjie immediately looked at Long Zhengyu like he was a fool and then sneered, “Do you really wanna know?”</p><p>“I do, humor me!” Said Long Zhengyu with an indifferent expression.</p><p>While pointing at the Seacraft Hall, Du Yunjie said, “Then come with us. And let’s have a good chat as to ‘what price we can pay’ inside. Do you dare?”</p><p>Long Zhengyu turned to Tang Xiu and spoke in all seriousness, “Today’s my fault. I shouldn’t have brought you here. But since he wants to play, how about I follow the script to give you some relief?”</p><p>Tang Xiu, on the other hand, also felt that Du Yunjie indeed had gone too far as he asked more after getting what he wanted. After thinking about it, he asked, “Are you sure?”</p><p>“I never do something I don’t have a confidence about.” Long Zhengyu nodded.</p><p>“Then let’s go inside and have a chat with them since you’re so sure!” Tang Xiu let out a faint smile. “I’m actually quite annoyed myself. You can leave it to me if you can’t handle it.”</p><p>Du Yunjie frowned and looked at Tang Xiu and Long Zhengyu seriously. He was sure that he had never seen these two men. With his knowledge about the scions of the prominent families in Blue City, he was sure never saw them before. Therefore, the trace of dread he had inside previously was suddenly wiped out from his heart. He sneered as he watched those two enter the Seacraft Hall, and gave eye signals to the few people around him before following them inside.</p><p>Li Chunlei was scared. He didn’t think things would evolve to this extent. He wanted to stop Tang Xiu and Long Zhengyu, but the latter’s grim expression made him realize that he wouldn’t be able to do so. His mind was racing as he hurriedly grabbed his mobile phone and dialed one of the shareholder’s number.</p><p>“Is there something up, Manager Li?” A lazy voice came out of the phone.</p><p>“Young Master Wang, something went wrong here,” said Li Chunlei hurriedly.</p><p>A dozen kilometers away from the Clearlake Club was a villa complex. Wang Zidong’s mouth clamped a cigarette while sitting at the mahjong table, playing with the gloomy Huang Xu in front of him, along with two other young men with bleached hair and tattoos on their bodies on his left and right.</p><p>Wang Zidong, who just touched his beard and suddenly heard the report that something happened from Li Chunlei, immediately laughed and said, “Don’t be that anxious, speak slowly. Even if the sky is falling down we’ll push it back up again.”</p><p>“Young Master Wang, Du Yunjie is having a conflict with other guests in our club,” said Li Chunlei bitterly. “Originally, he had left the Seacraft Hall and the other guests then booked it. But he suddenly returned, wanting the box back and making the other guests get out. But then Du Yunjie demanded them to pay up for their bill in the Seacraft Hall today. Although the guests are only two men, I can tell that their identity is not simple either, hence the cause of their conflict.”</p><p>Wang Zidong frowned, “Okay, I’ll speak to Old Huang about this. I’ll go there myself if he doesn’t.”</p><p>Having said it, he immediately hung up the phone.</p><p>Huang Xu flipped his eyelids asked, “Is there something up?”</p><p>“Something trivial happened at the club. Du Yunjie just ate a loss today, and he vented out his bottled up anger and finally had a conflict with two guests there. Are you going back, or should I go handle it?” Explained Wang Zidong.</p><p>“Do you think I still have the will to solve such a trivial matter today?” Asked Huang Xu.</p><p>“Ah, forget it then.” Wang Zidong shook his head and forced out a smile. “I’ll go since you don’t want to.”</p><p>Ring, ring, ring… His mobile ringtone sounded again.</p><p>Seeing that it was Li Chunlei who called him again, Wang Zidong immediately asked with an annoyed tone, “Is it done already? I said I’m about to go there, didn’t I?”</p><p>“Young Master Wang, are you with the Big Boss?” Asked Li Chunlei quickly.</p><p>Wang Zidong directly hung up the call. He just said that he would go there, yet Li Chunlei still called him. This was simply stupid.</p><p>****</p><p>Clearlake Club, Seacraft Hall.</p><p>After Tang Xiu went in, he took the initiative to go to the sofa in the corner, took a seat and lit up a cigarette to watch the play that was about to unfold. He knew that Long Zhengyu could do a bit of Kung Fu, though he was not that powerful, but that was enough to deal with two or three small hoodlums.</p><p>“What are you called, brat?” Du Yunjie squinted at Tang Xiu and immediately asked Long Zhengyu.</p><p>“You’re not qualified to know my name.” Long Zhengyu sneered. “Let’s talk about this matter first! How do you want to solve it?”</p><p>Du Yunjie was furious. He grabbed the ashtray and threw it at Long Zhengyu. As he saw that the latter could avoid it, he immediately shouted, “Beat him! Either he comes out crawling today or it will be me!”</p><p>With a cold light glinting in his eyes, Long Zhengyu then stabilized his body after avoiding the ashtray. He immediately grabbed the coffee table and exerted his strength to smash it toward Du Yunjie and the other youths.</p><p>“FUCK! (MOTHERFUCKER!)”</p><p>The complexion of the youths drastically changed. The two-meter-long coffee table hit their calves, and the aching pain made them furious.</p><p>However, Long Zhengyu had dashed toward them and delivered his fist to one of the youth’s face, and then knocked the other one with his body. As the two youths fell to the floor, he then trampled on their faces.</p><p>“FUCKER…”</p><p>At this time, the other two youths reacted and rushed toward Long Zhengyu. However, these two were the kind who had their bodies hollowed out by wine and women and could only last a dozen seconds before getting beaten on the floor by Long Zhengyu, who even kicked their faces after they were knocked out. He went so far as to flatten the previous two youths whose nostrils were bleeding and had blood also coming out of the corner of their mouths.</p><p>Du Yunjie was scared and flabbergasted. Never once did he dream that the four friends he brought were so wasteful. They joined hands to beat a guy yet were knocked upside down by him instead. He knew that he himself was not good at fighting and therefore hurriedly called out when he saw that Long Zhengyu was walking towards him, “Wait a minute!”</p><p>Long Zhengyu stopped his pace, but in order to prevent the other four from getting up, he kicked the two men’s head heavily and directly made them faint. Then, he turned around to look at Du Yunjie and sneered, “What’s wrong? Are you scared?”</p><p>Clenching his fist, Du Yunjie angrily said, “I, Du Yunjie, don’t know how to write the word ‘fear’. I admit you can fight, but today’s society does not belong to those who can fight. Gimme a chance to make a phone call if you really have the ability. In half an hour you will know what you will get after offending me.”</p><p>Long Zhengyu furrowed his brows. Though his Long Family was very powerful in Star City and his father had a lot of contacts in Blue City, yet this place was, after all, Blue City. And like people said, even powerful dragons were unable to suppress local snakes. If this bloke really had a big background in Blue City, then it would be very difficult for him to calmly leave.</p><p>Tang Xiu flicked and pointed his cigarette as he smilingly said, “Zhongyu, I think you should allow him to make a phone call. He’s right. A single combat is nothing, but a full-scale combat does sound interesting.”</p><p>Long Zhengyu looked at Tang Xiu and his furrowed brows immediately smoothed, and there was even a faint smile on his handsome face as he nodded and said, “Young Master Du, isn’t it? Since you want to call for help, then hurry up. We haven’t eaten yet, thus I don’t have much time to waste with you.”</p><p>Though pretending to look angry on the surface, Du Yunjie was actually very nervous inside. He was afraid that the other party wouldn’t give him a chance to make a phone call and even heavily beat him. If it did happen, suffering physical pain would be inevitable. Though he may be able to get back to the game in the public later, the news of him being beaten would definitely spread in Blue City’s social circles.</p><p>“Hey, Qiangzi, bring our men to the Clearlake Club!”</p><p>“Understood!” The other party replied and directly hung up the phone.</p><p>Du Yunjie then shot Long Zhengyu a cold glare before turning around and sitting on the sofa on the other side.</p><p>A minute later, Li Chunlei pushed the door open and walked inside. He was slightly stunned after seeing the scene inside, before his complexion drastically changed after.</p><p>He never thought that the fight inside had already broken out though he just spent a little time to make a phone call, yet the result was beyond his expectations. The four men brought by Du Yunjie were all beaten, and even two of them were rolling about on the floor, whining in pain, whereas the other two were lying lifelessly on the floor like dead dogs.</p><p>Fortunately, Du Yunjie was not beaten, else this would not end well, thought Li Chunlei inside, feeling fortunate.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
