He looked at Tang Xiu as he forced a smile and said, “Brother Tang, it’s been really unfair to you today. I’m sorry. This face of mine is so painful that I have no mind to do anything, so you can play and do everything you want!”</p><p>Tang Xiu put down the chopsticks. Then he smilingly looked at Huang Xu and said, “This is a good place indeed, but this place is, after all, your territory. Since you’ve said that, then you won’t mind if I don’t refrain myself anymore, yes?”</p><p>“It’s all up to you!” Huang Xu nodded with an ashamed face.</p><p>Tang Xiu grabbed a bottle of Gods Nectar from the table. Under everyone’s watchful eyes, he took a few steps toward Du Yunjie. When he saw the latter taking a few steps backward, he smiled and said, “What happened today is nothing but a little conflict! But you acted so arrogantly because this place is your territory and used it to bully us. Therefore, since those people you called have yet to arrive, I’ll make you first carve this memory on you as a reminder for you to behave and not be so rampant again later.”</p><p>As his voice faded away, Tang Xiu dashed and instantly appeared in front of Du Yunjie as he smashed the wine bottle on his head. Wine and blood splattered at the same time, as Du Yunjie staggered backward and almost fell to the floor a few seconds later. Tang Xiu then delivered a heavy slap to his face, pulled him and threw him to the door as the guy heavily slammed on the floor.</p><p>Aaargh… Shrill screams came out of Du Yunjie.</p><p>Tang Xiu shook his head as he forced a smile and said, “You dare to make trouble everywhere with such abilities? You really are asking for the road to ruin.”</p><p>At this time, Long Zhengyu finally put down the chopsticks and casually shot a look at Du Yunjie, who had been badly beaten and was slumped on the floor. His eyes then fell on Huang Xu and hummed with resentment, “Contrary to what I expected, you really pushed this matter to make yourself clean, Young Master Huang. I sweet-talked Tang Xiu to come over to Blue City on a heavy snowy day just to support and cheer you up. Then, what do we have in the end? Nothing but some damn bad luck. Look at my face! Getting a slap on it is so hurtful. I was bragging to Tang Xiu before we came here that you are really capable now and how great your club is. And now?”</p><p>Huang Xu was so embarrassed that he wished to find a crack in the floor to burrow himself into. He then said with a bitter expression, “Young Master Long, today was indeed unjust for you. I can’t make it up for you today, but please look forward to my performance until this matter has concluded. Is that okay with you?”</p><p>Long Zhengyu rolled his eyes at him in response and hummed, “You can be considered as thoughtful, kiddo. But there’s another thing, though. What happened to your mobile phone? I’ve been calling you but can’t connect at all.”</p><p>With lips trembling a little, Huang Xu helplessly said, “This reminds me of that shameful matter that happened two hours ago. It was because of this idiot—Du Yunjie. He provoked two scions from Shanghai who came here. Who could have thought that those two turned out to have a deep background in Blue City? As a result, my mobile was broken by others, and I was even jeered and sneered at.”</p><p>“Some people from Shanghai?” Long Zhengyu was surprised. “Tang Xiu has been living in Shanghai for less than half a year, right? Tell me, what’s the origin of the other party?”</p><p>“One is Zhang Xiaolei, the eldest son of Zhang Yueming, the owner of Shanghai’s Xinyang Group, while the other one is Gu Tao, the son of Dingshen Media’s owner. These two guys have a very formidable background, especially Zhang Xiaolei, since his uncle is the second authoritative figure in Shuangqing Province.”</p><p>Long Zhengyu let out a strange smile as he looked at Du Yunjie with some admiration. He praised while raising his thumb and sighing, “This buddy truly is awesome! Each and every character he provokes is more powerful than the other. He even dares to provoke two scions from two major companies. That’s really admirable! I’m truly convinced!”</p><p>Having said that, he then looked at Tang Xiu and smilingly asked, “Tang Xiu, tell me. You have been living in Shanghai for nearly half a year, do you know these two fellas?”</p><p>“Nope, I don’t know them.” Tang Xiu shook his head. “But I have a bit friendship with their fathers, though.”</p><p>Puff… “WHAT?”</p><p>Long Zhengyu, who was sipping tea, spurted it out. Huang Xu was struck dumb and tongue-tied with a shocked expression in his eyes.</p><p>“Yeah, they’re friends I met on the wine table just by chance, really,” said Tang Xiu with a smile.</p><p>Long Zhengyu let out a wry smile while shaking his head and then sighed, “Tang Xiu, more and more I realize the disparity between us. I’m just like a toddler as I got along with those big shots, whereas you have already made a bridge and befriended them. You know, you gotta introduce me to these people if there’s a chance later, so as to give me a chance to elevate my good points and get close with them.”</p><p>Tang Xiu couldn’t help but chuckle, “Don’t talk like this, will you? Anyways, tell me. How do you want to play this game tonight?”</p><p>Looking at Du Yunjie who got up from the floor, Long Zhengyu grinned, “How about doing it like your usual style?”</p><p>Tang Xiu nodded and looked at Huang Xu, “Young Master Huang, this kiddo surnamed Du should have more a powerful background than this, right?”</p><p>“The Du Family is ranked in the top five in Blue City,” answered Huang Xu with a forced smile.</p><p>“Okay, please do me a favor.” Tang Xiu nodded. “Call someone who can be regarded to have a voice in the Du Family and tell him to come over and bring some people. Emphasize it that they will only collect the dead body of this Du brat if they don’t come within an hour!”</p><p>Huang Xu’s heart thumped and he abruptly got up. He hastily walked toward the door and shot Du Yunjie a deep look, who was still dizzy, as he shook his head and bypassed him. After coming outside, he called Du Yunjie’s big brother, Du Yunlong.</p><p>“Something happened again, Huang Xu?” A cold voice came from the phone.</p><p>There was a bitter smile on Huang Xu’s face as he replied, “Yeah, something happened, big time. You… you better contact your father or someone with the biggest authority in the Du Family. Your little brother just stirred up trouble in my club. Big trouble!”</p><p>“That fucking bastard, who the hell did he provoke this time?” Du Yunlong cursed.</p><p>“It’s Long Zhengyu of the Long Family and Tang Xiu from Star City,” said Huang Xu.</p><p>“Tang Xiu?” Du Yunlong was silent for a moment before asking. “Which Tang Xiu, exactly?”</p><p>“You should have heard his name, too, right?” Huang Xu smiled bitterly. “Which Tang Xiu can make me call you? Just come quickly! He said that if someone with authority from the Du Family doesn’t come here within an hour, then he will give you the dead body of your little brother!”</p><p>Afterward, Huang Xu hung up the phone and was about to return to the Seacraft Hall when he saw Wang Zidong also coming out from the inside and had his lips wriggling. He apparently wanted to speak but was hesitating.</p><p>“You got something you wanna say?” Asked Huang Xu with a forced smile.</p><p>Wang Zidong threw a quick glance at the door before asking in a low voice, “Huang Xu, I heard the name Tang Xiu before. He should be the Young Divine Doctor from Star City Chinese Medical Hospital, right? Does he have a very powerful background?”</p><p>Huang Xu was silent for a few seconds, and then answered in a whisper, “What do you think about those two fellas Du Yunjie provoked tonight, do they have strong backgrounds?”</p><p>“Big ones!” Wang Zidong nodded cautiously.</p><p>Huang Xu replied with a taste of ridicule in his voice, “Even if the forces behind those two guys is added and multiplied by ten, they still won’t be able to match Brother Tang Xiu’s. Above him… is the sky.”</p><p>He pointed his finger up while saying this.</p><p>Wang Zidong was flabbergasted. It took dozens of seconds for him to be able to react, yet there was a shocked and panicked expression on his face. He had already thought of the prominent families surnamed Tang who could be the most powerful family in the country.</p><p>There should be one… and that was the Tang Family of Beijing.</p><p>As of the past two months, there had been a major earthquake in the bureaucracy of the government in the country as numerous office positions changed, along with the shifting of rights and benefits in extension. The ultimate cause of this great earthquake was exactly the Tang Family of Beijing. His family, the Wangs, had quite an influence in Shuangqing Province, so he had been paying attention to the matter as well, and he naturally knew how terrifying the Tang Family was for being able to decimate the Yao Family.</p><p>Du Yunjie is done for.</p><p>He then recalled the advice he gave to Tang Xiu and Long Zhengyu before, and couldn’t bear to let out a bitter smile. At that time, he was nothing but a joke in their eyes, right?</p><p>Inside the Seacraft Hall.</p><p>Tang Xiu picked up the hot tea delivered by the waiter. After tasting it twice, he said, “Huang Xu, don’t let anyone from this club block the people from the Du Family from coming here. Regardless of who they are and how many people come over, allow all of them to enter. Zhengyu is kinda vexed inside, so he must vent it out.”</p><p>Huang Xu only smiled bitterly and nodded.</p><p>A few minutes later, Li Chunlei called Huang Xu, informing that A’ Qiang had arrived with a dozen or so people and was heading toward the Seacraft Hall.</p><p>Bam…</p><p>The door was kicked open as a stocky middle-aged man with knife scars on his bald head entered. Following him from behind were dozens of ruthless-looking middle-aged men who quickly walked inside. Fortunately, the Seacraft Hall was large enough and didn’t feel crowded even though all of them came in.</p><p>“YOUNG MASTER DU!”</p><p>A’ Qiang was startled upon seeing Du Yunjie’s appearance. He hurriedly dashed over and propped him up.</p><p>At this time, the chagrined feeling inside Du Yunjie’s heart had reached the limit. He also knew that today’s matter had come to the point that it wouldn’t end in a friendly manner at all. Therefore, after A’ Qiang came to his side, he pointed at Tang Xiu and Long Zhengyu and shouted, “Beat them up for me. I’ll take the responsibility for whatever happens!”</p><p>Upon hearing this, A’ Qiang issued orders without a shred of hesitation. His backer in Blue City was the Du Family. He knew that he would end up in trouble if he went against Du Yunjie’s wishes at this time.</p><p>“STOP!” Huang Xu angrily yelled.</p><p>The dozens of people, however, didn’t even spare him a glance and stormed over toward Tang Xiu and Long Zhengyu.</p><p>Tang Xiu scornfully sneered inwardly. His figure instantly flashed over and clashed with them. If it wasn’t for the sake of not exposing magic spells to the people present here, he would have used it to blow up the wits of these goons already.</p><p>Bam, bam, bam…</p><p>When his fists came in contact with their flesh, bone breaking sounds and screeching screams interlinked into a single note in just a few dozen seconds. More than a dozen ruthless people with kung fu foundation were all beaten by Tang Xiu under everyone’s watchful eyes. The most notable of all was that Tang Xiu acted very ruthless as he straightly broke both of their legs.</p><p>“How is this possible?”</p><p>A’ Qiang’s complexion drastically changed and looked horrified. He had a good kung fu and was only a step shy of the martial arts grandmaster level, and more than a dozen of his men had been practicing Kung fu ever since they were children. Some of them were trained by him and had an extremely rich combat experience. Yet now… how come they were all beaten and knocked out in just a dozen seconds or so?</p><p>“WHO ARE YOU?” Asked A’ Qiang angrily.</p><p>“Relying on your qualification to know who I am? Dream on!” Tang Xiu sneered.</p><p>A’ Qiang released Du Yunjie and pulled out a pistol from his waist, pointed its muzzle to Tang Xiu and scornfully said, “Your kung fu is indeed very formidable. But I wanna know who’s faster, you or a bullet!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
