A beautiful woman was like a wine who had thoughts and considerations of her own, and a man must act, and at the same time, do everything he could to capture her heart, showing his appreciation with kind words or gifts to showcase himself as a “strong and real” man. But in regards to feelings, Yue Kai was not one who was able to invest in them. For instance, this girl beside him. What she settled on was Yue Kai’s money, while the latter was taking a fancy in her flesh.</p><p>Finding amusement when the occasion arises and nothing else but for fun.</p><p>So as to make Xie Xiaotong give up her ballooning appetite, he directly took out his mobile phone and secretly sighed upon seeing that the caller on the screen was Tang Xiu’s name. As a man himself, he deeply admired Tang Xiu in his way of chasing and picking up girls, for those top belles were like moths fluttering to a flame. He had never seen what kind of magic trick and spell Tang Xiu cast on them, and yet, all those belles gathered around him.</p><p>“Big Bro Tang, you’ve always been busy, how come you remembered me? Did you miss me?”</p><p>Envy and admiration may mix together, but Tang Xiu was his classmate, dorm mate, and a brother Yue Kai approved and identified himself with, so chit chatting and teasing was a must-have.</p><p>“Bah, cut the garrulous crap, will you?” Tang Xiu mocked him. “Anyways, I got something to consult, or rather, ask your help with.”</p><p>“Woah, no kidding?” Pretending to be surprised, Yue Kai called out. “Does Big Bro Tang want me to be there for your beck and call? Then, tell me, it will be my pleasure to serve you!”</p><p>“Can you not happily chew the rag?” Tang Xiu snappily said. “I have some time and want to buy something, but I’m not experienced in this area. Let’s just meet and chat.”</p><p>“What thing did you talk about?” Asked Yue Kai immediately.</p><p>“Women’s clothes!” Tang Xiu touched his nose and smiled dryly.</p><p>Yue Kai rolled his eyes, immediately patted his chest and said, “I may not be sure of other aspects, but I guarantee that I can make you satisfied regarding buying women clothes, buddy.”</p><p>Suddenly, his eyes lit up. He quickly glanced at Xie Xiaotong beside him and smilingly said, “What a coincidence! It just so happens that I’m also taking my paid girlfriend to the Golden Eagle Shopping Mall. Do you know the Golden Eagle Shopping Mall in Hong District? It’s on the Tianhua Avenue.”</p><p>“Yeah, I know it. I’m in the vicinity.”</p><p>“Then come over now! I’m in the Hermes exclusive store on the 6th floor.”</p><p>“Got it!”</p><p>After hanging up the phone, Yue Kai stuffed the mobile phone into his pocket and rubbed his hands with an excited expression. He did not know about others, but he knew perfectly well that Tang Xiu was a superrich who lived in an extravagant home and drove a luxurious car—a guy wallowing in money. He was now short on money, and now that this guy came over, it was simply a timely rain from the sky, a friend in need indeed!</p><p>Xie Xiaotong looked at his expression and curiously asked, “Who called you, honey? Seems like that person is coming here too, no?”</p><p>With a somewhat brazen smile, Yue Kai said, “A buddy of mine. He owes me some money. I don’t have much pocket money recently. The reason being is, he borrowed most of my money. It seems like this buddy of mine recently hit a fortune and he’ll give me back my money!”</p><p>Xie Xiaotong’s eyes lit up and she held Yue Kai’s hand tighter. Originally, Yue Kai spent money in front of her extravagantly, proving that he was rich and lavish. He even still had more money, but he lent it to his friend! Xie Xiaotong thought that Yue Kai would buy her famous brand clothes and various articles of luxury goods as well as dealing with her bills. The thought immediately excited her and made her lower body feverish at the moment, for she could not wait to employ every trick of horse riding art she had to make him prostrate under her skirt.</p><p>“Alright, let’s have a look at the bags first!”</p><p>“Let’s go.”</p><p>Ten minutes later, Tang Xiu came to the sixth floor of the Golden Eagle Shopping Mall and spent some time to find the Hermes exclusive store. When he saw the smiling Yue Kai watching a girl who was unceasingly choosing handbags, he immediately came to him and then said, “I did not disturb you, did I, Yue Kai?”</p><p>The way Yue Kai looked at Tang Xiu was like he was seeing a gold mountain. He shook his head like a beaten drum, and his face, that was as beautiful as a woman’s, wore a bright smile as he replied while rubbing his hands, “Nope. How come you’re disturbing me? Anyways, you borrowed money from me, can you pay it back? You don’t know, Buddy. I have been so poor recently that I did not have a thing to eat at all. Just look at that pretty girlfriend of mine. She wants to buy a bag but I’m almost broke myself.”</p><p>Tang Xiu stared blankly and found that the girl who chose the bag also looked up to see him, but did not pay attention anymore and continued choosing the handbag. Then, he immediately looked at Yue Kai and, shaking his head, smilingly said, “How much is it?”</p><p>“50 thousand yuan,” answered Yue Kai immediately.</p><p>Tang Xiu smiled and secretly stuffed his hand into his pocket and took out 50 thousand yuan in cash from his interspatial ring. He threw it to Yue Kai directly and said, “Well, I’m returning the money to you, but don’t take your words back and help me get my things done, then account between us is cleared.”</p><p>It was Yue Kai’s turn to stare blankly, with eyes staring so wide they almost popped out, staring at the Tang Xiu’s pocket. If it wasn’t for him holding 50 thousand yuan in hand and counting them, he would have come over to rummage that pocket. How could 50 thousand yuan in cash be stuffed into such clothes?</p><p>“Big Bro Tang, did you just conjure some magic?”</p><p>Tang Xiu snappily replied, “That was originally the money I withdrew to buy the clothes. But I did not expect it to be exactly the amount I needed to ‘return’ to you. So, do you want it or not? If you don’t, then give it back.”</p><p>“Hell no, who said no?” Yue Kai put the two stacks into his pocket, and then went to the checkout counter and dropped the remaining 30 thousand yuan on it. He then said to his girlfriend—Xie Xiaotong, “Hurry and pick your choice, babe. I already put the money in the checkout counter, so you can pay the bill directly. Keep the rest for your pocket money if there’s some left. My buddy and I will go out to the entrance to smoke and have a chat.”</p><p>“Got it!”</p><p>At the moment, Xie Xiaotong held a Hermes bag she took a fancy in, and her sharp eyes glanced at the checkout counter and saw three stacks of red 100 yuan bills placed on it. She immediately put down the Hermes bag in her hand and selected another slightly worse quality and much cheaper bag in the next partition.</p><p>Buying a bag was her motive, but if the rest of the money was for her own pocket money, she did not want to waste too much!</p><p>At the store entrance.</p><p>There was an embarrassed expression on Yue Kai’s face as he rubbed his hand and spoke with a dry smile, “Thanks for this time, Big Bro Tang. I’ll pay you back next month.”</p><p>Tang Xiu could not help but laugh and said, “We’re brothers, so leave out talking about money since it’s kinda offensive, don’t you think? Anyways, are you available to help me pick some women clothes?”</p><p>“Your matter is of the utmost importance in the Heaven and Earth, Big Bro Tang.” Yue Kai nodded. “Let alone girls, even if such a great event as the sky falling, they must be put aside first. Anyhow, lemme see bid that girl farewell first, and then we’ll go shopping.”</p><p>That girl?</p><p>“Are you doing it for fun?” Asked Tang Xiu curiously.</p><p>Yue Kai lit a cigarette, puffed twice, and said, “Without having some fun, don’t tell me I have to invest in some feelings too now? I know perfectly well that women nowadays are very materialistic. You too heard what Qingsong said before, no? The craving for material things reigns in this age of materialism, where money is the principle of truth! Women… tsk, tsk. Just have fun and playing with them will do. If you do have a good life later, you may meet a good one and marry her so you can be said to make a hit yourself. If you don’t chance upon one, you might as well be muddleheaded.”</p><p>Tang Xiu rolled his eyes at him. He was helpless as far as Yue Kai’s deranged fallacy was concerned. However, each and every person had their own circumstance, and naturally had a different way of thinking as well. At present, Yue Kai said what he thought as if seemingly the truth, but maybe he would meet a girl one day, one who could satisfy what his heart had been wishing for and step into the matrimony sanctuary ahead of time, ultimately hugging a chubby boy earlier.</p><p>“Dear, I want the latest Hermes bag.”</p><p>A coquettish voice came from the left side, as a woman with a voluptuous body and beautiful looks held a handsome young man who was donned in various famous brands from head to toe. Her posture was literally almost hanging on the young man.</p><p>A smile outlined on the handsome young man’s mouth as he said, “Then buy it. You can buy them if you like it, honey. We’ll buy three to five of them.”</p><p>The girl’s eyes lit up and she immediately said with pleasant surprise, “You’re the best, dear. I’ll serve you and definitely make you feel great after we go back home tonight.”</p><p>“I love it.”</p><p>During the chat, the couple walked past Tang Xiu and Yue Kai. They did not even glance at them and headed straight into the Hermes store.</p><p>“What a foolish spendthrift.” Yue Kai rolled his eyes and whispered.</p><p>Tang Xiu’s smile looked strange as he commented, “I think you’re just same, mate!”</p><p>Yue Kai was stunned and his face immediately blushed with shame. He touched his nose and coughed, “No, it’s different. Absolutely different. At least I never said ‘Honey, we’ll buy three to five as long as you love them’… Hahaha.”</p><p>Tang Xiu ruthlessly slammed him, “That is because you’re poor as dirt.”</p><p>Yue Kai’s face was pulled down and said helplessly, “Big Bro Tang, don’t send me such a deadly blow, will you? If I had a financial source like yours, I would have been disinclined to see that woman inside or the woman who just passed by. I’d definitely find myself the best women.”</p><p>Tang Xiu shook his head and did not feel like responding to this creature again.</p><p>After the cigarette was completely burned out, Yue Kai then called Tang Xiu and walked toward the Hermes store. Just as he strode inside and saw the situation there, his expression instantly turned gloomy, since his girlfriend Xie Xiaotong acted so intimately, pulling the arm of the handsome young man who had just entered the store and tried her best to fawn upon him, while the other woman also did not want to be outdone by her and took the young man’s other hand.</p><p>Much to Yue Kai’s indignation, the handsome young man seemed to welcome the two beauties, with his arms coiled around their shoulders while his fingers slid across their makeup covered faces from time to time.</p><p>“You both are my babes. This young master is very happy today, so you can pick whatever bag you like and I’ll pay it,” said the handsome young man with a particularly bright smile.</p><p>\"XIE XIAOTONG!\" Yue Kai dashed a few steps forward and shouted, looking incensed.</p><p>The girl glanced at him and looked flustered. She hurriedly released the handsome young man’s hand and wanted to break free from his hand. But that handsome young man obviously heard Yue Kai’s shout clearly as he furrowed his brows. Not only did he not loosen Xie Xiaotong’s shoulder, he even forcefully pulled her to his chest.</p><p>Ugh…</p><p>Xie Xiaotong somewhat regretted it. She had just seen Young Master Wu and was so excited that she forgot herself and ran straight to the young man and did everything to please him. She knew his identity as the only son of the Wanjian Group, who grew up with a golden spoon since childhood. He was rich and handsome with an illustrious identity—an existence a countless number of people would look up to in the future. He was simply the perfect wealthy husband in her eyes.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
