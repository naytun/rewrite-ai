With the help of Tang Xiu and consuming two healing medicinal pills and half a bottle of Body Refining Liquid, he turned this misfortune into a blessing since his physical body became more formidable and his cultivation also faintly improved.</p><p>As grateful Miao Wentang right now, it was Shao Mingzhen who was envious of him.</p><p>“Why wasn’t it me who got injured?”</p><p>While watching Miao Wentang performed a set of fists fast, perfect, and smoothly, Shao Mingzhen sighed with a sour tone. At this moment, Tang Xiu was simply like a treasure vault in his eyes—a treasury vault with an endless number of treasures. He felt envious of Chen Zhizhong all of a sudden and even genuinely admired the man inwardly. With such a powerful Master like Tang Xiu, wasn’t he highly likely to obtain many benefits, too?</p><p>Miao Wentang wiped the sweat off of his face and grinned, “Brother Shao, do you think it feels good to get injured so badly? I was just a shy close to death, even if it did turn into a blessing in disguise right now, I never want to go through this a second time.”</p><p>“Bwahaha!” Shao Mingzhen mockingly laughed at him and his eyes then fell on Tang Xiu, who came out of the house.</p><p>Donning sportswear, Tang Xiu walked to the courtyard and said, “It’s about time, Brother Miao. Let’s go to the place where you were attacked after we have a breakfast! Though we’re not sure whether this Western Nefarious Sangha and Golden Armored Zombie are still there, we still must look for them. Redress not the enmity and you are a man no longer, so finding them is a must to let them pay the necessary price.”</p><p>Miao Wentang shuddered inside as a tinge of dread flashed inside his eyes, and he replied with a helpless expression, “Brother Tang, I know that you’ve become very strong now, but the Western Nefarious Sangha is really too queer. He has all sort of despicable and shameless means that he puts out one after another endlessly, and his cultivation is also stronger than mine. And that Golden Armored Zombie, he did not even act but I still got a chill down my spine by only his aura. How about waiting for some more time? It’s never too late for a man to take his revenge ten years later, so we’ll come back to find them again when we become stronger, how about it?”</p><p>Tang Xiu shot a deep gaze at Miao Wentang’s eyes and realized that the man really did not want to face Western Nefarious Sangha and Golden Armored Zombie.</p><p>Miao Wentang had… succumbed to his fear.</p><p>Tang Xiu’s vision then landed on Shao Mingzhen and also found that the man nodded with a cautious expression. Eventually, he had to force a smile and said, “Alright, I’ll follow the major vote since you two don’t want to face them. Anyways, let’s just have breakfast and leave!”</p><p>“Alright!” The two men nodded and did not speak more.</p><p>****</p><p>Longquan Bay, at one lakeshore with gleaming water under the sunlight, two waterfowls flapped their wings and continually streaked toward the sky, hitting the horizon with all their momentum. Their reddish sharp eyes were two times bigger than that of ordinary waterfowls, with sharp talons that were slender and yet very sharp.</p><p>Whoosh…</p><p>A raging wind swept through as the two waterfowls streaked upward for tens of meters, dripping a few drops of blood, and its large feathers fell down before its trace was gone completely.</p><p>“YOU COURT YOUR DEATH, ZOMBIE!”</p><p>A roar of rage came from a bald headed monk sitting cross-legged on the shore. There were nine incense scars on top of his head, donned in a bright Kasaya, big round earrings decorated his ears, and a magical wand laid on his knees. A dreadful aura erupted from him and blotted out the sky toward the feathers.</p><p>Hehehe…</p><p>Amid a terrifying laughter, a humanoid monster appeared out of thin air donning a golden armor attire with a black cloth on his face that only exposed his eyes.</p><p>“Don’t be so stingy, Western Nefarious Sangha! Those birds are nothing but puppets. You can still control some more casually, right? Anyways, I’m very hungry; I’m starving. Maybe I can eat to the full if you give me that Sky Sandstone.”</p><p>“We are done with our trade!” Western Nefarious Sangha coldly snorted. “This Sky Sandstone is mine. Scram and leave me alone if you know what’s good for you, else don’t blame for being rude.”</p><p>“Let’s have a gamble. Isn’t gambling what you like the most?” Golden Armored Zombie maniacally laughed. “How about I tell you where that Miao guy is, and you give me this Sky Sandstone?”</p><p>Western Nefarious Sangha’s face moved and looked at Golden Armored Zombie. Then he immediately sneered and shook his head, “I’ve seen tons of clever deceptions, but don’t think to play me with this petty trick. However, if you lead me to that Miao guy and I get more Sky Sandstones from, I may share it with you equally.”</p><p>The Golden Armored Zombie cried out in a strange voice and flew away, but a tiny voice was transmitted to Western Nefarious Sangha’s ears: “Longquan Village.”</p><p>****</p><p>Longquan Village.</p><p>The ten SUVs started, but the people who boarded each car were few in number. Miao Wentang originally brought along more than 20 men with him, many of whom were experts he had fostered, but now there were only two bodyguards and one secretary left.</p><p>“Let’s go! Let’s leave this damned place,” spoke Miao Wentang with a deep sigh. He sat next to Tang Xiu and glanced at Shao Mingzhen on the front seat.</p><p>Tang Xiu’s brows pricked and said faintly, “I’m afraid it won’t be easy for us to leave now.”</p><p>“What do you mean?” Asked Miao Wentang with a confused and blank expression.</p><p>“There are things that we won’t be able to hide in this world from,” said Tang Xiu faintly. “We may be unwilling to find these people, and yet they actually came looking for us. Seems like entering the game where they die or we must perish is inevitable!”</p><p>After saying that Tang Xiu pushed open the door and got off. As he walked forward for five-plus steps, his eyes then fell on the old man who waltzed through the entrance of Longquan Village.</p><p>“It’s him!” Miao Wentang’s expression changed greatly, and there was fear deep inside his heart as though he was currently facing an enemy who was preying on him.</p><p>“Amitabha, Benefactor Miao is really skillful. You’ve been poisoned by this penniless monk’s Seven Flowers Seven Insects Poison, and yet the poison was unable to kill you. Moreover, you turn out to have invited so many helpers as well, eh?” Western Nefarious Sangha spoke loudly with a contemptuous look.</p><p>Stepping forward, Miao Wentang stood side by side with Tang Xiu and glared at him, “You worked together with Grandma Shipo to trap me. I intended to let this go and was about to leave this place back to the mainland. Little did I think that you would be so aggressive and overbearing to even chase me here. Western Nefarious Sangha, do you really want to bully me so much?”</p><p>“Amitabha.” Western Nefarious Evil nodded and smilingly said, “Benefactor Miao is indeed a good target to be bullied.”</p><p>“You…” Miao Wentang was incensed and knew that today’s matter would not end in an amicable way. He also did not want to endure it anymore, for he had a limit to the degree of anger he could restrain. More so that he was forced to this point and if worse came to worst, he would fight till they perished together. The instant he drew his sword, he already bolted towards the Western Nefarious Sangha.</p><p>“Golden Armored Zombie, I know what you have in mind, bastard. You must have a wishful thinking to earn a profit as the third party from this fight between me and them. This brat Miao is very easy to deal with, but there are still some brats who’re not easy to handle here. If you don’t show up, then I’ll leave at once!” Keen and alert as he was, Western Nefarious Sangha could not tell how strong Tang Xiu was, making him secretly cautious inside. But the aura emitted by Shao Mingzhen was not weaker than Miao Wentang’s, and the most notable thing was that this group of people felt very particular, as he could sense that half of them should be cultivators, more so that they seemed to be the kind of ruthless and fierce bunch.</p><p>“What skill! You’re really too difficult to plot against!”</p><p>Golden Armored Zombie came with his howl. When he saw Miao Wentang and Western Nefarious Sangha clashing, he immediately stood at the side and shook his head after sighing.</p><p>Tang Xiu glanced at Shao Mingzhen and said, “Go help Brother Miao. Leave this corpse to me.”</p><p>Shao Mingzhen complied and flashed towards Western Nefarious Sangha.</p><p>Obviously, Golden Armored Zombie could hear Tang Xiu’s words as his eyes finally fell on him. He carefully scrutinized Tang Xiu, let out a strange laughter and said, “What a spirited brat. But young as you are, even if you’ve been cultivating since you were still in your mother’s womb, how high would you’ve gone, to begin with? Come, let this majesty give you 300 moves…”</p><p>Tang Xiu stuffed his hand into his pocket and took out a porcelain bottle. He shook it toward Golden Armored Zombie and smilingly said with a ruminating look, “Hey bogeyman, do you believe that I won’t be able to take care of you?”</p><p>Golden Armored Zombie waved his hand as a dazzling golden spear instantly shot towards Tang Xiu and his figure followed the instant after, appearing in front of Tang Xiu in the blink of an eye.</p><p>The golden spear only pierced a shadow, but Golden Armored Zombie’s fist struck Tang Xiu’s left shoulder. His was extremely fast, and even if Tang Xiu avoided it to the best he could, his speed was slightly slower than his. However, at this moment, Tang Xiu flicked his finger and opened the porcelain bottle’s lid as the liquid inside it brought about a corrosive stench and sprinkled on Golden Armored Zombie’s body.</p><p>Zi Zi zi…</p><p>The pungent stench of a corpse being corroded quickly spread out, and amidst the white smoke coming out from Golden Armored Zombie and despite him having an iron skeleton and copper skin body, he still let out a shrill scream. In just a short hundredth second, he had already escaped and streaked to the sky.</p><p>Western Nefarious Sangha, who was facing Miao Wentang’s and Shao Mingzhen’s joint attacks, suddenly heard Golden Armored Zombie’s miserable howl and immediately looked toward the other side.</p><p>“How is it possible? What kind of method that brat used to make that Golden Armored Zombie suffer such a great loss?” Western Nefarious Sangha was secretly shocked.</p><p>“I thought I would waste a lot of energy and effort to deal with you. Never thought that my conjecture was correct, that you’re really afraid of the Body Dissolving Liquid. Hahaha…” Tang Xiu loudly laughed.</p><p>As his voice faded away, he had already dashed towards Golden Armored Zombie. He wanted to kill him to seize his treasures, something he had done so many times before. And yet, he was really looking forward to this time. He found that Golden Armored Zombie had an Aerolite Essence hung on his waist.</p><p>Aerolite Essence! It was a precious ore comparable to the Sky Sandstone that had an enormous effect to improve the immortal sword’s intrinsic quality. Tang Xiu decided that he must obtain this Aerolite Essence and fuse it into his Bloodguzzler Dagger, so that it would be greatly enhanced. Moreover, it was also highly likely that it could turn into a spiritual device in a very short time.</p><p>“Awu, you must ensure their safety! I’ll return immediately after I’m done finishing Golden Armored Zombie.” Tang Xiu’s voice sounded as his body was about to disappear in the sky.</p><p>A cold expression painted Mo Awu’s face. Though he and the ten experts of the Everlasting Feast Hall were still weak, he was ready to give his all even if he had to sacrifice everything to execute this order!</p><p>“Release your swords!” Mo Awu shouted loudly, as a longsword then appeared in his hand, followed by similar longswords also appeared in the other ten experts’ hands.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
