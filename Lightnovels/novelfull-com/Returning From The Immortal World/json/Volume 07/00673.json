If anything, I’m really vexed and resentful since you made a fuss in the good thing I was about to have tonight. You know what? It was not only my foot got twisted, but also my arms, waist, and neck… So, you’re responsible for giving me a massage now.”</p><p>Andy’s big eyes lit up with a happy expression. She hurriedly crawled up to the sofa while pinching Kang Xia’s shoulders, then she laughed and said, “Alright, Chief. Then call Boss now. I don’t care whatever lies you use, it’s fine as long as he get deceived.”</p><p>“Dream on!” Kang Xia rolled her eyes at her.</p><p>Ring ring ring…</p><p>The mobile phone’s ringtone was ringing in the bag and Kang Xia took it. Seeing that it was a call from Tang Xiu, she immediately connected and smilingly said, “Boss, Andy wants you to come back. She’s waiting for you and kind of wants to pet you.”</p><p>“Cough, cough… knock it off, will you? Just get dress up, the two of you. I’ll be coming to your villa shortly. There’s something I need to do.” Tang Xiu coughed twice and then said with a serious tone.</p><p>“What is it?”</p><p>“It’s for interrogating… enemies.”</p><p>“Alright.”</p><p>A few minutes later, after Kang Xia and Andy had neatly dressed up and come to the first floor living room, they saw that Tang Xiu had come in with Mo Awu and four fainted men.</p><p>“Who are they, Boss?” Asked Kang Xia with a confused expression.</p><p>“They were tracking us in secret; Awu discovered them. Awu, wake them up,” said Tang Xiu.</p><p>Mo Awu nodded and walked to the front of the four men and used the crudest mean: stepping on their wrists and breaking them. He then went to Tang Xiu’s side when they woke up due to the pain.</p><p>“Who are you?”</p><p>Though the four men’s wrists were broken, no scream came out from them, and the asking big man’s eyes were even full of killing intent.</p><p>“Ordinary people would have already screamed if their wrists got broken. Now, tell me! Who are you? Why are you following me?” Sneered Tang Xiu.</p><p>“Hmph, we don’t know what you’re talking about, nor who you are.” The big man snorted. “Society runs under the law nowadays, and I demand you to release us. Else you can expect to have a very serious criminal charge on you for kidnapping.”</p><p>“Did the people who send you to follow me not tell you who I am?” Tang Xiu jeered. “Do you think stubbornly refusing to talk can help you cope with what you will go through? If you’re smart, explain your identity and the purpose why you are following me, perhaps… I can spare your life. Else, you can be sure that death won’t be your end, for I have too many ways to make you keep your life, longing to be alive and to die and yet unable to ask for both.”</p><p>The big man’s pupils contracted and he could not restrain his body from twitching. Suddenly, he pulled out a sharp dagger from his arms and stabbed his comrade’s heart.</p><p>BAM…</p><p>Mo Awu acted in a flash and kicked the stout man’s head, knocking him out directly. He then quickly inspected the man whose heart was stabbed, turned to Tang Xiu and shook his head, “He can’t be saved.”</p><p>Tang Xiu hummed coldly and shifted his vision toward the other two men who were obviously frightened judging from their pale faces. He then said with indifference, “I know why he acted like that and killed your comrade all of a sudden. He’s afraid that your comrade will disclose any information. One died and one will follow, adding more two or three deaths won’t be much of difference, no? What about you? Do you still want to conceal it, or will you confess truthfully?”</p><p>“I’ll speak!” The man shot an angry look at the stunned stout man and immediately said, “We are from the Strange Doors—intelligence agents of Eight Families Alliance under Strange Doors. We got ordered to investigate your identity and find out the power you belong to.”</p><p>People from Strange Doors?</p><p>Tang Xiu furrowed his brows and hummed coldly, “Hmph, under whose command?”</p><p>“I don’t know.” The man shook his head. “But my leader is the person in charge who’s in contact with the people above. However, I know that six teams were sent to investigate you, with each consisting of four people. We were the first to arrive in Star City, and the other five teams should be arriving within two days.”</p><p>Tang Xiu then looked at the other man.</p><p>That man also hurriedly said, “That’s true. That’s all I know about this.”</p><p>Tang Xiu then nodded to Mo Awu, as the latter stepped on the fainted stout man’s other wrist to wake him up again.</p><p>“Tell me, which person of the Strange Doors gave you the order to investigate my identity? I know what you have in mind, and why you suddenly killed your comrade. But I can tell you something. Your Strange Door’s people are nothing but trash in my eyes. No one in the Strange Doors will go on living if I want to kill you all,” said Tang Xiu with a cold expression.</p><p>The stout man glared angrily at his other two comrades and then sneered, “Hmph, relying on you? Snort… our Strange Doors has a lot of people possessing special abilities. Let alone… forget it. I demand you to release us, else you are dead!”</p><p>“You said let alone… is it those two cultivators, Jin Sanchi and Jin Sijie?” Said Tang Xiu indifferently.</p><p>The stout man’s body shook with disbelief in his eyes as he exclaimed out in alarm, “How do you know?”</p><p>“Seems like it is really them who sent you to investigate me, no?” Tang Xiu sneered. “Hmph, had I known earlier they would not give up their sinister idea, I should have slain them in Kanas directly, so as not to leave trouble like this.”</p><p>“You…”</p><p>The stout man dumbfoundedly looked at Tang Xiu with an increased heartbeat. Though he did not witness what happened in Kanas himself, he heard a lot of information about it. Never did he expect that this guy would say these words in front of him.</p><p>Could it be… this guy was the one who not only killed the Serenity Sect’s Young Master—Xuan Yugu, and the Elegant Chess Saintess’ disciple—Wang Hu, but also the one who injured the two Immortal Masters, Jin Sanchi and Jin Sijie?</p><p>“You know a lot of things, it seems, eh?” Said Tang Xiu indifferently. “That’s right, I was the one who spared Jin Sanchi and Jin Sijie in Kanas because I did not want to kill more. However, never did expect that those two could be so wicked and unable to give up their sinister idea to scheme against me. Now, tell me, where are they now.”</p><p>“I don’t know!” Though this big man was filled with fear inside, he still shook his head.</p><p>Tang Xiu’s expression turned cold. He released a strand of qi to the air as it wrapped the stout man’s neck, directly pulled him from the floor and hung him in the air. He sneered, “I just don’t want this to be to too troublesome, so I want to know it from your mouth. Else, I can wait for the following investigation team to come here. I’m hella sure some of them will know where Jin Sanchi and Ji Sijie are! Conflicts between cultivators are not something small shrimps like you can involve into. Say no to me and no opportunity will be left for you. I will make you scream and whine for three days and nights before I break all of your bones and cut your blood vessels, only then will I let you swallow your last breath.”</p><p>BAM…</p><p>The stout man was thrown back to the floor. His face was red as he coughed painfully and yelled with bloodshot eyes, “YOU WANNA KNOW IT FROM MY MOUTH? DREAM ON!”</p><p>“Since it came to this point, then I’ll investigate your family,” said Tang Xiu casually. “I’ll torture and kill each and every one of your family members in Strange Doors. Hopefully, your family only have few children and old people there.”</p><p>“OKAY, I’LL TELL YOU!”</p><p>The big man shivered and his eyes were full of despair. In his eyes at this moment, Tang Xiu was akin to a demon in human skin. He could die, but he knew that all of his family members would be killed if a cultivator made up his mind to retaliate against his family. Even as Tang Xiu said, they would be murdered inhumanly.</p><p>“The two Immortal Masters… are in Kanas.”</p><p>Tang Xiu nodded in satisfaction. Just as he was about to speak, his expression suddenly changed. He got up and kicked the big man and directly killed the other two men. Following that, he looked at Mo Awu and shouted, “Call the men who are guarding the Immortal Abode in Longquan Bay. Tell them to withdraw at once and find somewhere to hide.”</p><p>Mo Awu’s expression moved and he immediately took out his mobile phone. He let out a helpless expression as he found that he could not contact them after trying for several times.</p><p>“There should be no signal over there, Boss. I can’t contact them at all.”</p><p>“BLOODY HELL!” Tang Xiu cursed. He quickly fished out his phone and dialed Jie Walie’s cell number.</p><p>“Brother Tang?” Jie Walie’s voice was heard on the phone.</p><p>“Brother Jie, there’s something I need your help with,” said Tang Xiu quickly. “This may be very dangerous and may cost you your life. But you’re the only one I know of in Kanas that can help me now.”</p><p>Jie Walie was silent for about half a minute, and then asked in a solemn tone, “What is the matter?”</p><p>“There are four of my men standing guard in a certain valley in Longquan Bay. I hope you could rush there to inform them to evacuate immediately before an accident befalls upon them. I’ll send you the detailed map later.”</p><p>“Got it.” Jie Walie hung up directly after saying that.</p><p>Tang Xiu put away his mobile with a bit apologetic look in his eyes. He knew that he did not have a deep friendship with Jie Walie, and yet, asking his help in this matter was his last resort. In the unlikely event that Jin Sanchi and Jin Sijie were to return to that place, those four men of his would probably be victims of their treachery.</p><p>He too realized something! He would owe Jie Walie a huge favor once the man did what he asked. And this favor would be on him no matter where he went and regardless of him being alive or dead.</p><p>“Awu, deal with these four dead bodies and then wait for me at Star City Airport. I’ll go back to South Gate Town first,” said Tang Xiu after he got up to leave.</p><p>“I’ll go with you, Boss,” called out Kang Xia hastily.</p><p>Tang Xiu’s pace came to a stop as he turned his head and shook his head. “Your cultivation is still too low. Not only will you be unable to help me, you may also become a burden. Staying here to manage the Magnificent Tang Corporation is for the best. Also, everything that happened here tonight must not be disclosed to the outside.”</p><p>“This… I understand. Please be careful.” Kang Xia nodded without speaking more.</p><p>“Don’t worry!” Tang Xiu said. “I will not take risks without full assurance. Besides, you still have the research institute to concern about, and I’ll leave for Shanghai directly after handling things in Kanas. Just call me directly if something happens on your end.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
