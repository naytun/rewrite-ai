Yet, what appeared in his mind was Western Nefarious Sangha’s cave planted with herbs where the Soul Tranquilizer and solidified Dragon’s Eye were embedded on its ceiling.</p><p>Don’t tell me… it’s where the Immortal Trove is located? If the Immortal Trove is really there, then why that monk did not tell me? Did he know about it and yet concealed it from me intentionally?</p><p>After pondering for a short while, Tang Xiu slowly said, “Wang Hu and Xuan Yugu are your names, right? The two of you are nothing but trash, the type of people I hate. I, Tang Xiu, always keep my promises to good people, but never restrain myself from taking my words back on the evil ones. So, you two just remember. Become good guys in your next life.”</p><p>The Bloodguzzler Dagger shot out like lightning and easily sliced off the duo’s head, and then returned to Tang Xiu’s hand. A moment later, Tang Xiu left with Mo Awu.</p><p>At the foot of the mountain, Jie Walie looked anxious and restless, praying that Tang Xiu would come back alive. Needless to say that he had a business deal with Tang Xiu, he did not want him to have an accident in his company, merely because Tang Xiu was related to his former platoon leader.</p><p>“Brother Walie, just listen to me. You gotta leave now! If Tang Xiu is killed in the mountain and the other party lives, I’m afraid they will also act against you considering their personalities. You don’t know how terrifying these people are,” persuaded Gesangjor in a low voice after sighing inwardly upon seeing Jie Walie’s expression.</p><p>Jie Walie fell into silence for a moment before a firm look appeared in his eyes. He shook his head and said, “My former platoon leader introduced him to me. I must wait until I see the outcome even if I cannot help him. I will collect his dead body if he dies, and I’ll celebrate it with him if he lives.”</p><p>“You are just as stubborn as in the past.” Gesangjor shook his head and forced a smile. “Aargh, forget it. Stay you want to, then! I guarantee your protection as you collect Tang Xiu’s body as long as those old codgers don’t come back.”</p><p>“Thanks! I…”</p><p>Inwardly, Jie Walie felt more downcast as he squeezed out an ugly, thankful smile. However, he had yet to finish his words as his expression turned into that of joy, as his eyes stared at the three men coming down from the mountain pathway.</p><p>Gesangjor was baffled and turned his head to the mountain pathway, and then his expression changed into disbelief as he exclaimed, “What the hell happened here? Tang… how did they come down? What about the other three guys?”</p><p>Nearly a hundred people from the Xuan House in the surroundings made a ruckus, as they never expected that the people coming down turned out to be Tang Xiu’s group of three, and the three people from Xuan House actually disappeared. Could it be… that they were all killed by them? How was this possible?</p><p>“OH GOD! LOOK AT THE LAST MAN. HE IS CARRYING TWO HEADS!”</p><p>An exclamation suddenly broke out in the crowd.</p><p>Everyone’s eyes turned wide in a flash. As they saw the three figures coming closer and closer and saw the two heads in the hands of the Everlasting Feast Hall’s expert in the back, only then did they recognize that those were Wang Hu’s and Xuan Yugu’s heads, showing that both of them were dead.</p><p>“Does this mean that the Justice Hall’s Master of the Serenity Sect failed in his job? How could he watch Xuan Yugu being killed?”</p><p>“Then what happened to that guy? Those heads are Xuan Yugu’s and Wang Hu’s, where’s the other one?”</p><p>“It’s really unbelievable. I never expected that the Young Divine Doctor Tang Xiu would come out as the final victor. He… what is the origin of his two bodyguards, exactly?”</p><p>“This is going to cause a big ruckus in the Strange Doors!”</p><p>“A great show will happen for us to watch!”</p><p>\"...\"</p><p>As Tang Xiu arrived in front of Gesangjor and Jie Walie under the disbelieving watchful eyes of the numerous onlookers, he nodded to Jie Walie and immediately shifted his gaze to Gesangjor, saying, “The problems with people from the Strange Doors have been settled with the custom made by Strange Doors itself. I have killed them, so I’m the final winner.”</p><p>A complicated expression could be seen from Gesangjor’s face as silently nodded, “You did win, but I’m afraid you will have to bear the wrath of the Jin Family and the Serenity Sect.”</p><p>“I dare to kill, so I’m ready for the consequences.” Tang Xiu sneered. “However, I have some things to tend to now and won’t stay here for long. That’s right. I just killed a hare with the hunting rifle. I’ll give it to you, and you can immediately eat it with wine.”</p><p>Gesangjor could only force a smile secretly and said, “Go then! You just killed some of these people, and you staying here will only leave you a road to death. You had better leave this place as quickly as possible to avoid things going wrong later. Walie, come with me to drink a few cups of wine while tasting this hare.”</p><p>“I gotta leave, too!” Said Jie Walie quickly.</p><p>“You gotta stay!” Gesangjor knitted his brows. “I still have important things to tell you.”</p><p>Tang Xiu deeply gazed at Gesangjor. He could tell that the reason the man’s intention to detain Jie Walie was to draw a line between Jie Walie with himself so as to avoid the people from Jin Family and the Serenity Sect from retaliating against him out of rage. Therefore, Tang Xiu let out a tranquil smile and said, “Two Old Brothers, since you have important things to discuss, then I bid you farewell. We’ll be in touch later.”</p><p>Saying that, he did not give a chance for Jie Walie to speak again and left with Mo Awu’s group of eleven. He did not take the car as they left the hunting grounds. When everyone in the hunting grounds could not see them anymore, Tang Xiu silently chanted a Dao spell as a wave of air seemed to wrap around the waists of Mo Awu’s group of eleven and pulled them to the air and flying toward the direction of Longquan Bay, toward Western Nefarious Sangha’s Immortal Abode.</p><p>****</p><p>Longquan Bay.</p><p>Western Nefarious Sangha stood outside the entrance of the cave with a murderous aura emanating from him as he glared at the two brothers, Jin Sanchi and Jin Sijie. If stares could kill, he could have killed these two men countless times already.</p><p>The broken-armed old man—Jin Sanchi languidly spoke, “Well, Nefarious Sangha, good people never live long, but evil will keep scourging for millennia. I trust that us—two brothers should be a scourge in your eyes, right? If anything, it was really a pity that you weren’t able to kill us with your poison yesteryear, else there wouldn’t be any need for us to use such great fanfare, no?”</p><p>Grandma Shipo took a step forward as she covered her mouth and smilingly said, “Jin Sanchi, there’s something that’s rather baffling me here. Since you two brothers covet this Immortal Trove, why did you have to involve these people from the Strange Doors? There are indeed some remarkable guys among them who can break through the shackles of the martial arts path and able to enter the Dao and become Foundation Establishment Stage cultivators by virtue of their own martial arts path. But, do you really think they can help you? Or, could it be that you two brothers intentionally brought them here as cannon fodder?”</p><p>Jin Sanchi’s face slightly changed and he sneered, “Shipo, I never expected for you to not have the slightest progress in all these years as Nefarious Sangha’s beloved mistress, eh? Such a trivial method to sow dissension between us is useless. Now that I have brought them here, I admit that I indeed have the intention to lead them too. That’s right, didn’t you taste how powerful they are, Nefarious Sangha?”</p><p>With a gloomy expression, Western Nefarious Sangha reminded in a low voice, “You two must be careful. These damned people from the Strange Doors unexpectedly have some magic tools. I was careless and not checked them out and suffered some internal injuries a while ago.”</p><p>There was a disbelieving expression on Shipo’s face as she exclaimed, “What magic tools were they carrying to think that you got injured?”</p><p>“Those were very strange magic tools.” Western Nefarious Sangha forced a bitter smile. “Other than that shield that can be combined temporarily, the other two magic tools have a very destructive power. That’s right. Beware of their talisman charms too. They have Raging Flame talisman charms, and its might is quite potent as well. A pity that those two Bloodthirsty Chiropterans I’ve been raising for so many years got trapped by their nets.”</p><p>“You should have abandoned those two Bloodthirsty Chiropterans a long time ago,” commented Shipo without hesitation. “You’ve been feeding them with your blood essence to raise them. Not only has it affected your cultivation speed, it will also give you a backlash one day. They will accidentally kill you. Miserably!”</p><p>“Let us not speak about that first now, shall we?” Said Western Nefarious Sangha with indifference. “Now that they dared to come here it means that they are well prepared. Fortunately, that guy has left, else we’d be in a huge trouble if we met him.”</p><p>“Who’s this guy?” Asked Shipo, wondering.</p><p>With a look of gloating at his companion’s misfortune, Golden Armored Zombie let out a strange grin and smilingly said, “Hehehe, this lover of yours was hit with very bad luck, Shipo. He nearly got killed by those people, after which he got a seal cast on his soul that controls his life. Hehehe… that was the kind of scene that depicts the adage that ‘humans will die for riches just as birds will die for food’. He unexpectedly dared to conceal the existence of the Immortal Trove from him. I just really hope that this matter won’t be exposed in the future, or else… Hahaha….”</p><p>Western Nefarious Sangha looked a bit resentful and angry as he glared angrily at Golden Armored Zombie and cursed, “If you did not fucking sell me out to him and told him where I was hiding, I wouldn’t have…”</p><p>Jin Sanchi and Jin Sijie exchanged looks in wonderment. They never expected that Western Nefarious Sangha was nearly killed by someone else, and even had a seal cast on his soul and had his life under the control of that person.</p><p>Who could that person be?</p><p>Western Nefarious Sangha was very formidable already, could it be that the other party was more formidable than him? Furthermore, wasn’t there also Golden Armored Zombie with him? Could it be that he just watched as the other party trashed Western Nefarious Sangha so helplessly like that?</p><p>However, upon recalling their purpose in coming this time, Jin Sanchi did not feel like asking about it and shouted in a deep voice, “Nefarious Sangha, I’m giving the three of you a chance to live, submit and be obedient without putting up a fight, and help us open the Immortal Trove in this Immortal Abode. Else you three will die very tragically.”</p><p>Western Nefarious Sangha sneered, “Keep talking in your dreams, you fucking idiot! All those who cast their greedy eyes on the Immortal Trove must die!”</p><p>A few kilometers away.</p><p>Tang Xiu and Mo Auw’s group of eleven quietly landed in the woods. After instructing the eleven people to stay and wait, Tang Xiu then turned himself into a cold breeze and silently lurked towards the Immortal Abode where he ambushed Western Nefarious Sangha. From far away, he could see a lot of people gathered there facing three people: Western Nefarious Sangha, Golden Armored Zombie and a woman.</p><p>After a while, Tang Xiu hid in the woods four hundred-plus meters away and silently observed them. Even though he stood there, he could faintly hear their dialogue.</p><p>“There’s indeed an Immortal Trove there! Western Nefarious Sangha did not tell me about it, so he definitely has some selfish motives, or has plotted something devious in mind.” A killing intent flashed in Tang Xiu’s eyes. The Soul Ruling Spell had a special effect in that the controlled person would be very loyal.</p><p>However…</p><p>Such negated usefulness on Western Nefarious Sangha was a very rare exception. And with his high intelligence, Tang Xiu could guess that there must be some problems with it.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
