After a long silence, he suddenly laughed loudly and a burst of momentum erupted from him, as he ridiculed her with a clear voice, “I never expected that you would learn to mystify things, Old Blind. Where is the mandate of Heaven, fate, or destiny now in this era? I was almost fooled by you.”</p><p>Old Blind shook her head, sigh and looked at Daoist Qiankun with pity in her eyes. She slowly took out a pair of golden gloves underneath her clothes and wore it lightning fast. Daoist Qiankun’s face greatly changed, and there was also dread on it.</p><p>Picking Stars Catching the Moon!</p><p>It was the strongest card Old Blind had. He was once suppressed by her with this technique and trapped inside the Abstruse Yin Ground for so many years that he nearly had his soul vanish.</p><p>Daoist Qiankun took a deep breath. He grasped the snare drum and said coldly, “Old Blind, it seems that you really want to be that brat’s lapdog, huh?”</p><p>Gently spreading her hands, Old Blind turned the walking stick in her hand into powder that scattered along with the wind, and then said tranquilly, “If he can provide a shelter for this Old Blind to spend her old age, and also gives me an opportunity to have a breakthrough, what’s wrong with becoming his lapdog? Hundreds of years passed, what else that can’t be seen through and what more can’t be passed through?”</p><p>“You court death!”</p><p>The snare drum in Daoist Qiankun’s hands immediately flew, as the shadow of the drum hovered over his head. As the drum sounded, a tidal-like soundwave surged toward Old Blind.</p><p>“Heavenly Secrets… Picking Stars Catching the Moon!”</p><p>Old Blind’s disheveled white hair suddenly erected, and dazzling lights suddenly burst out from the golden gloves as she waved her hands. Six miniature versions of planet images appeared in the sky as if they were summoned. The miniature images of planets then came down with a loud bang.</p><p>“DAMN! You’ve actually succeeded in practicing the Six Starlight Array!”</p><p>Daoist Qiankun cursed. His body rose straight from the ground, inciting the layers of shadow drums to collide with the six miniature versions of the planet images. At the same time, he pulled out a sharp dagger from his sleeve and pierced his own forehead to force out his blood, and then quickly threw it into the drum shadow.</p><p>The layered drum shadows suddenly rose in an instant, with a layer of blood light emerging on each of them. The Heaven Earth spiritual qi in all directions seemed to be strongly attracted and constantly seeped into the drum shadows.</p><p>“EXPLODE!”</p><p>With a flushed complexion, Daoist Qiankun maniacally bellowed and brandished the dagger in his hands even more violently.</p><p>BOOM…</p><p>A deafening sound erupted from the collision of the drum shadow and the planet miniatures, creating tidal-like airwaves sweeping away to all directions. A towering tree that was struck by the airwave behind Daoist Qiankun was uprooted and flew hundreds of meters away.</p><p>On the opposite mountain peak.</p><p>The two experts of the Everlasting Feast Hall got up in instant and released their flying swords at once. With grim expressions, they coldly glanced at the direction of the fierce fight between Daoist Qiankun and Old Blind, since they felt that the violent airwave coming at them was from that direction. The two exchanged looks and could see horror and dread in the other’s eyes.</p><p>They may have broken through to the Foundation Establishment Stage at present, but the impact created by the intense combat between such powerhouses still made them palpitate. They had gone through dangers and risked their lives for innumerable times, and therefore were very sensitive to the absolute gap between their strengths with those powerhouses who were now in intense combat.</p><p>“I don’t know them.” One of the Everlasting Feast Hall’s experts took the binoculars and observed the appearance of those two people and shook his head.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>Two figures rushed out of the cave lightning fast. When they learned of what happened, one of them immediately said, “Let us hide first no matter who they are. We won’t be able to survive if they want to deal with us given their strength. Also, we must find a way to call Boss right away and tell him what’s happening here.”</p><p>“Got it!” The other three nodded.</p><p>They did receive an order to guard the cave and protect the Immortal Trove, but it was unlikely they would sacrifice themselves for nothing since they fully aware that this was a circumstance where they were not a match for the enemy at all.</p><p>“Hehehe… now that I have found you all, don’t even think about leaving!” Grasping a long spear in his hand, Jin Sijie appeared in front of the quartet like a ghost. His cultivation had reached the Peak Foundation Establishment Stage and was half a step away from breaking through to the Golden Core Stage. He could confront these four from the Everlasting Feast Hall easily and thus looked down on them.</p><p>“It’s you, Jin Sijie.”</p><p>Jin Shi, the name of an expert of the Everlasting Feast Hall. His eyes were staring intently at Jin Sijie as he shouted in a deep voice, “Our Boss spared your life before. I never expected that you would still dare to have eyes on the Immortal Trove. Are you not afraid that our Boss will come back with a huge force and completely destroy you?”</p><p>“Had it been a couple days ago I may have to worry about that. But now… Hahaha. Your death is imminent, and I’m too lazy to talk nonsense with you. GO TURN INTO STUPID GHOSTS IN HELL!”</p><p>The long spear in his hand was shot out in an instant to impale Jin Shi’s head. He did not use all his strength, and even used less than 80% of it, yet he was confident in his judgment that these four men could not avoid it.</p><p>“FORMATION!”</p><p>Just as Jin Shi was braving such a dangerous situation, the other three had already moved and the Four Phenomena Formation was formed in an instant. Four flying swords flew up in a circle and smashed the ordinary long spear. In a rapid turn under the control of Jin Shi’s group of four, it had Jin Sijie surrounded in the middle.</p><p>“WHAT? IMPOSSIBLE!!!”</p><p>With a drastic change in expression, disbelief flashed from Jin Sijie’s eyes. He was an expert at the Peak Foundation Establishment Stage. Even though the weapon he used was not a magic treasure, it was highly unlikely for it to be smashed in an instant like that.</p><p>This sword formation… Bloody Hell, these four fellows unexpectedly have broken through the Foundation Establishment Stage as well!</p><p>Jin Sijie cursed. As formidable as his body may be, he would only be at disadvantage without a formidable weapon. He could only explode out his True Essence to form an explosive punching light to smash the sword shadow that plunged toward him in rapid twisting moves.</p><p>BOOM…</p><p>The sword formation was broken as Jin Sijie and the quartet flew backward and spurted out blood at the same time. Despite the sword formation they arranged and its might that was equal to the four men’s power added together, it still could not withstand the eruption of Jin Sijie’s power. However, the one that ended up the most miserable was not them, but Jin Sijie. At the moment, his fist was smashed by the sword formation and it also had shattered his hand, leaving only half of his entire right arm.</p><p>The sword images also left tattered wounds on Jin Sijie’s body and instantly turned him into a blood-painted man.</p><p>“IMPOSSIBLE!!!”</p><p>A grieving and heartbreaking scream came out of Jin Sijie’s mouth. His body suddenly plunged back for hundreds of meters as he flew in the air and looked in disbelief at his own broken arm. He could not figure out why the sword formation could break his defense and even inflicted such a heavy blow on him. Even if those for longswords were all magic weapons, it would not be able to do so, right?</p><p>Jin Shi’s group of four gathered again in an instant. Their faces looked pale and had their blood stirred up inside. And yet, they stared coldly at Jin Sijie along with intense killing intent.</p><p>Far away in the distance.</p><p>Daoist Qiankun, who had been fighting with Old Blind, did not pay attention at all to the fight between Jin Sijie and Jin Shi’s group of four, since those four were nothing but kids who were only guarding the place without many abilities, so it would be very simple and easy for Jin Sijie to kill them.</p><p>However, when he heard the miserable scream from Jin Sijie and looked in their direction for a moment, his complexion changed greatly along with disbelief in his eyes. He knew perfectly well the state of cultivation of his disciple at present, and yet, never did he ever dream that his disciple, with a Peak Foundation Establishment Stage cultivation, would be so severely injured by four ant-like existences. It was a tragedy!</p><p>BOOM…</p><p>When Daoist Qiankun was distracted, Old Blind released a silk golden thread instantly and nearly bounded him.</p><p>“Damn wretch! Since you old bastard are looking for death, then I’ll fulfill your wish!” The most ferocious side of Daoist Qiankun was stimulated. He was already at disadvantage using the technique to fight against Old Blind’s Picking Stars Catching the Moon technique and couldn't care less about it anymore. He released the Golden Core inside his body as three savage-looking shadows were instantly separated from him.</p><p>The last time he got trapped by Old Blind was because he was negligent and was too late to release his ultimate trump card, resulting in him getting suppressed. But this time, he would never give her another chance. Since she seemed to be trying to pester him, then he might as well blast everything he had and go for the kill!</p><p>Three shadows flew in three directions and instantly flashed to the front of Old Blind. As the silk golden thread was cut by the dagger floating around him, his ping-pong-sized Golden Core erupted a bright light and bombarded Old Blind’s chest. Following that, the three shadows also sent out barrages punches to bombard her.</p><p>“Heavenly Secrets, Everchanging Big Dipper Stars!”</p><p>Old Blind opened her ten fingers and released splashing golden fingers as they instantly pierced the three shadows sent out by Daoist Qiankun. Half a second after, she disappeared in an instant and appeared hundreds of meters away.</p><p>“Hahaha, Old Blind. I’ll make you taste the killing move I’ve been learning for decades. That was exactly a killing move that I’ve comprehended.” Daoist Qiankun himself was pierced through by the golden fingers, but the injuries were not serious, and instead, he maniacally laughed and plunged towards Old Blind with a distorted face.</p><p>Old Blind furrowed her brows and released the Everchanging Big Dipper Stars technique yet again. She immediately flew towards the opposite mountain peak and took only a few seconds to appear behind Jin Sijie. She flicked a Buddhist bead and it instantly shot towards Jin Sijie’s back.</p><p>One strike! And yet it made Jin Sijie’s injury even worse, misfortunes that piled up on one another.</p><p>However, Old Blind did not continue attacking him again but instantly appeared in front of Jin Shi’s group of four. She waved her hands as a stream of qi instantly wrapped their bodies and shouted, “Don’t struggle if you don’t want to die! This Old Blind has a relationship with Tang Xiu, so I can’t let you die in this place!”</p><p>Jin Shi’s group of four had their complexions changed. They just released their flying swords a moment ago, but after hearing Old Blind’s revelation, they immediately determined that she was a friend and not an enemy. As the flying swords returned back to their hands, they also retracted back their surging True Essence.</p><p>“LET’S GO!”</p><p>Old Bind stepped into the air and brought Jin Shi’s group of four flying for a kilometer before she spurted out blood. Despite her extremely fast speed, releasing the Everchanging Big Dipper Stars continuously made her injuries worsen.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
