This meant that the reason why his Master was trying his best to control the underground forces of Blue City was to… fawn upon someone else?</p><p>This… how could this be?</p><p>The identity of his Master was something Du Yunlong was perfectly aware of. Other than controlling the underground forces of several provinces, his Master also controlled two major companies with total assets of over 10 billion yuan, and the most notable of all was that his identity as a cultivator who possessed a mysterious power.</p><p>And yet, he unexpectedly still needed to fawn upon someone else despite this?</p><p>“Your cultivation is still very low, so your vision is still too shallow,” sighed Shao Mingzhen. “In the future, you will perhaps meet some people who are stronger than me in the world, who are capable enough to give me many benefits only by casually giving a few pointers. Anyways, since you already broke through to the Foundation Establishment Stage, I’ll take you to see him a few days later!”</p><p>This revelation from Shao Mingzhen shocked Du Yunlong. Ever since he formally acknowledged him as his Master since he was five years old, Miao Wentang from Haiqing Province was the only cultivator he knew of. He thought that he was already very formidable now that he had reached the Foundation Establishment Stage—a state where he could become a presence countless people would look up to. Yet now, who could have ever thought that there would be more who were stronger than his Master in this world.</p><p>“Thank you, Master!” Replied Du Yunlong with gratitude.</p><p>He had followed and cultivated under Shao Mingzhen’s tutelage from five to 16 years old and spent most of his time with him. In his eyes, Shao Mingzhen was more intimate than his own biological parents.</p><p>Quickly after, the two cars drove into the Clearlake Club. Shao Mingzhen didn’t get off the car since it was a conflict between ‘children’, something that didn’t require him to act at all. His gaze followed Du Yunlong as he entered the building, as then he slowly closed his eyes to ponder about things he had in possession that could make Tang Xiu take fancy in.</p><p>Inside the Seacraft Hall.</p><p>Just as Du Yunlong walked inside with his two men, he slightly furrowed his brows. He didn’t pay a glance to Du Yunjie who had been badly beaten, and even felt that his little brother deserved such a beating, else he would incite more trouble all day and would surely cause a big mess in the future. The scene that took his attention was A’ Qiang’s dead body on the floor, as well as the miserable state of dozens of his men.</p><p>“Yunlong.” Huang Xu immediately got up from the sofa upon seeing Du Yunlong and gave an eye sign, with his back against Tang Xiu and Long Zhengyu.</p><p>Du Yunlong narrowed his eyes and nodded. Then he looked at Du Yunjie and coldly said, “This is the second time tonight, isn’t it? Does being forced to cry out for help feels that good to you?”</p><p>Du Yunjie was never afraid of his parents, but was toward his big brother who possessed a terrifying strength. His lips squirmed a few times upon hearing Du Yanlong’s question, before lowering his head to answer, “It’s my fault, Brother.”</p><p>After snorting coldly again, Du Yunlong then turned to Tang Xiu and Long Zhengyu and indifferently said, “Two gentlemen, I’m well aware of my little brother’s character, and I’m afraid that he’s the first one who provoked you first. I would like to apologize to both of you on his behalf. I hope that you can have a broad mind and not stoop down to the likes of this ignorant brat.”</p><p>“Thank God there’s still a sensible person in the Du Family!” Said Long Zhengyu indifferently. “Your apology is needless since a third party is not needed when settling conflicts, so we naturally have nothing to blame you.”</p><p>“I already said that I apologize.” Du Yunlong unable to refute as he nodded and said, “Now let’s talk about something else. I’m sure you already know that A’ Qiang is someone backed by my family. Now that he is dead, it should be you who did that, shouldn’t it? And the rest is badly injured and some should have become disabled. Both of you acted too ruthless, I think you should explain this to me.”</p><p>“If it wasn’t for us possessing some abilities, it would have been us to end up in such a bad luck today!” Long Zhengyu sneered. “If it did happen, then who would explain it to us, huh?”</p><p>Du Yunlong fell into silence, but his sharp eyes glanced back and forth at the duo.</p><p>Tang Xiu, whose body was half-nesting on the sofa, folded his arms while letting out a smile and said, “So, what kind of confession do you want from us?”</p><p>“Men exchange fists with their power, money, and connections. But I can tell that you don’t bully others on someone else’s power, so I don’t feel like using these methods either. Given the fact that you can kill A’ Qiang and heavily injure his men is evidence that your individual martial strength is formidable. I’ll accompany you in a fight. I’ll do whatever you want if you win, but you will bow your head to apologize and give A’ Qiang and his men a proper aftermath deal.”</p><p>Tang Xiu ruminated for a moment before smilingly saying, “What good aftermath deal do you want, exactly?”</p><p>“You two don’t seem like people who are short on money,” said Du Yunlong. “So you will compensate 10 million yuan to A’ Qiang’s family and pay 2 million yuan for their each of their medical expenses.”</p><p>“You’re not bad.” Tang Xiu smiled. “A lot more benevolent than me. Alright, I’m probably not a man if I were to refuse that.”</p><p>After saying that, Tang Xiu got up from the sofa.</p><p>“Tang Xiu, this…” said Huang Xu hastily with a change in expression.</p><p>“It’s alright. It’s just for fun!” Tang Xiu smiled. “Rest assured, I promise I won’t kill him.”</p><p>Huang Xu forced a smile and said, “Tang Xiu, I’m afraid…”</p><p>Tang Xiu stared blankly and was at a loss whether he had to laugh or cry before he replied, “You mean… you’re afraid that I’ll be killed by him? Is he very powerful?”</p><p>“He is,” said Huang Xiu without thinking. “I can’t recall anyone in Blue City who can be his match. He once KO’ed 20 to 30 people…”</p><p>When he spoke up to there, he couldn’t continue talking anymore since he had just seen Tang Xiu in action a while ago, and Tang Xiu was also someone who could deal with a dozen hardened tough guys by himself!</p><p>“Don’t worry! I won’t kill him,” said Du Yunlong with an indifferent expression.</p><p>The arrogance shown by the Du Family’s brothers really made Huang Xu annoyed and vexed inwardly, as he immediately yelled, “Du Yunlong, even if you’re more powerful than Tang Xiu, you still must lose today, else your Du Family will…”</p><p>\"Huang Xu!\" Tang Xiu shouted in a heavy tone.</p><p>Huang Xu’s body shuddered as he turned his head at Tang Xiu with difficulty and said, “He has helped me a few times before and is my benefactor. Brother Tang, could you look at my face and spare him this time? I assure you he will never provoke you again in the future.”</p><p>Tang Xiu furrowed his brows and didn’t speak a word.</p><p>Taken aback and startled, Du Yunlong couldn’t help but observe Tang Xiu. Astute and wise as he was, he could tell from Huang Xu’s words that Tang Xiu was not someone ordinary and that his origin was probably earthshaking to make even Huang Xu frightened. But, what kind of background could it be to even frighten Huang Xu like this? He couldn’t be someone from the capital…</p><p>As he thought up to there, Du Yunlong said with a serious expression, “Huang Xu, I think you misunderstood something. We’re just sparring and comparing our martial strength. The conflict and grievances between him and my brother will be written off regardless of the outcome. I’ll do whatever they want if I lose, and they will only pay compensation for medical expenses if it’s the other way around. I believe that everyone here is a man, so we can accept the outcome of this trifling matter with equanimity.”</p><p>“Du Yunlong, yes? You’re a man with character.” Tang Xiu clapped and nodded with a smile. “Huang Xu, get back! He has said it, so I won’t haggle over this matter again whatever the outcome.”</p><p>Huang Xiu was secretly relieved and gratefully looked at Tang Xiu as he quickly stepped back.</p><p>There was a proud expression on Du Yunlong’s face as he flicked his finger at Tang Xiu and said, “Me fighting you is akin to bullying, actually, so I won’t fight back before your first three moves. I hope you can take my moves after that.”</p><p>An odd, strange smile appeared on Tang Xiu’s face.</p><p>With a sudden stride, he stepped forward and his speed instantly rocketed when he was just two meters away from Du Yunlong and slapped his face.</p><p>Pa… “First move!”</p><p>Tang Xiu’s voice sounded, and shortly afterward, a second loud slap was heard:</p><p>Pa… “Second move!”</p><p>Pa… “Third move!”</p><p>After three consecutive slaps, Tang Xiu instantly stepped back a few steps. While folding his arms, he looked at Du Yunlong and smiled, “Three moves are done. Do you still want to try to fight?”</p><p>Getting slapped thrice by Tang Xiu made Du Yunlong perplexed. He had broken through to the Foundation Establishment Stage at present. A martial arts grandmaster was akin to an ant in his eyes—and not even a dozens of them could be his opponents if he wanted to.</p><p>But… but how could the other party be so fast? He couldn’t react at all and was slapped thrice by him?</p><p>He… who could he be?</p><p>An alarm rang and fear arose inside him. But an intense feeling of shame grew inside his heart upon seeing the faint smile on Tang Xiu’s face. He clenched his fists tightly as he paced forward and dashed a few meters away in an instant while his lightning-like fist striked at Tang Xiu’s face.</p><p>Bang…</p><p>A muffled sound was heard. It was not Du Yunlong’s fist that hit Tang Xiu’s face but the latter’s foot that kicked the former’s chest as Du Yunlong’s body was directly sent backwards for seven-plus meters away and heavily fell on the floor.</p><p>Cough…</p><p>A mouthful of blood spurted out from Du Yunlong’s mouth. Just a kick had already caused his internal organs to become injured. Just as he bounced off the floor, Tang Xiu had already appeared beside him like a shadow, sending a barrage of fists towards Du Yunlong’s body like raindrops. Despite his face being hit just a few times, it still made his nose bleed and his face swell, all black and blue.</p><p>Finally, Du Yunlong’s body hit the wall and then fell on the lower part of the wall.</p><p>Tang Xiu deliberately flung his wrist and smilingly said, “Few people can stand up to my heavy beating. Though I didn’t use much strength, I think I have vented out my heavy mood quite a lot tonight. Well, Du Yunlong, we can continue to fight if you still have the ability to stand up again, but if you can’t, it means you lose.”</p><p>Du Yunlong spat out a few mouthfuls of blood but endured and suppressed the pain all over his body. He propped himself up from the floor, yet didn’t act again as shock and fear appeared on his face instead. He shook his head and said, “I lost already. Perhaps you only needed one strike to kill me if you wanted to. I lost… I fully admit it.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
