She was anticipating being taught an Immortal cultivation technique by Tang Xiu that could elevate her to become a powerful figure in the future. She found that she had a strong interest in arrays, and decided that she must learn and study this field whenever she had the opportunity in the future.</p><p>“Hey, you haven’t told me when you will teach me!”</p><p>Tang Xiu looked at the time and seemingly remembering something, he asked, “You said you haven’t eaten anything yet, right? Didn’t I already tell Awu to buy it?”</p><p>“Awu has come back long ago, you know.” Xue Yu smiled. “You just didn’t hear him coming since you were so infatuated in studying that book. Anyways, I’m not hungry. How about you teach me now?”</p><p>“No need to rush now.” Tang Xiu shook his head. “Let’s have a bite first and then I’ll teach you afterward.”</p><p>An hour later after, Tang Xiu and Xue Yu were full, the duo came back to the latter’s bedroom and Tang Xiu directly said, “Take off your clothes. I’ll teach you how to identify the acupoints and meridians first. After you’ve thoroughly grasped them, I’ll then impart you which channels to circulate according to the cultivation technique route.”</p><p>Take off my clothes?</p><p>Xue Yu hesitated for a short while, but she still took her coat off without speaking. Then, she undressed the shirt underneath it under Tang Xiu’s watchful gaze. When there was only underwear left on her body, her white face had already turned beet red, and even the roots of her ears were slightly reddish.</p><p>Never once had she ever worn so little on her body before any men since she was a child until becoming an adult, for there was a special custom for the tribes who lived in the Miao Region that a girl born there must never let any men see her body, not even their fathers…</p><p>Additionally, she was still a virgin and never had any physical contact with men. Even if she did prepare to give her first time to Tang Xiu, or even every time whenever he wanted it afterward, she still felt very embarrassed, shy, and nervous.</p><p>Looking at Xue Yu’s flawless body, Tang Xiu, who was originally going to start immediately, felt a flame starting to burn inside him after seeing her shy and blushing appearance. Despite having a firm self-control and venting his desire with Ouyang Lulu yesterday and today, yet that flame of desire was raging back like before.</p><p>“Undress everything.”</p><p>Sometimes, having experienced the first time would lead to the second, and having done it with someone would make one wanting the second one. For instance, a woman who went off the rails. It would be hard for her to escape from this aspect as she would put aside her restraint, believing that it did not matter if she did it again after doing it once.</p><p>It was the kind of psychology Tang Xiu currently had at this moment. He had already “occupied” Ouyang Lulu’s body, so it did not matter if he wanted Xue Yu’s body as well. More so that he did not want to be fettered and bound by himself upon facing an attractive woman.</p><p>“C-can… can I not take it off? Umm… I’m having ‘that’.” Xue Yu’s voice was a bit trembling and her ear turned redder.</p><p>Tang Xiu stared blankly and suddenly could not help but groan inside. He felt somewhat awkward and yet vexed inside. He then touched his nose and said, “If that is the case, let it be. I’ll teach you as far as possible, perhaps you can memorize it well.”</p><p>“Alright.” Xue Yu had been secretly observing Tang Xiu’s expression, only to find herself a bit disappointed as different kinds of emotions were born inside her heart. Tang Xiu used to behave like a gentleman, and she thought that she did not have what it took to make him interested in her. And now, seeing that he looked disappointed, it made her realize that she was actually quite attractive.</p><p>Time fleeted by. Just as the duo was immersed in the atmosphere of ‘teaching’ and ‘studying’, a scream suddenly came from downstairs. It was a woman’s scream and was piercingly loud.</p><p>“Shoot! The floor was just drilled through before and I forgot to deal with it.” Tang Xiu jumped from the bed, grabbed Xue Yu’s clothes, and threw them at her, saying, “Put on your clothes. Hurry! We gotta deal with this problem quickly before we continue.”</p><p>Realizing that they needed to address this issue now, Xue Yu quickly dressed up and followed Tang Xiu to the outside. When the two of them came down from the stairs, they saw a middle-aged man in pajamas rushing out of the compound, followed by a woman with disheveled hair.</p><p>“Are you the landlord of this compound?” Asked Tang Xiu after looking at the two of them.</p><p>The man seemed a bit flustered as well as angry after seeing Tang Xiu and Xue Yu coming down from the stairs, and loudly said, “That’s right, this is my home. Who are you?”</p><p>“We’re the tenants of your compound,” said Tang Xiu with a smile. “I apologize for the small incident that caused the floor to be pierced and bore a hole in the ground. This has affected you, so other than wanting to apologize, I’d like to pay for the damages no matter how much it costs. I can accept that.”</p><p>The middle-aged man’s expression instantly turned gloomier and he angrily replied, “You want to pay compensation? Do you think this is something that can be solved just by paying compensation? My home was all good and neat, and then my roof was hit by something all of a sudden and created a hole there, and even two floors were pierced through. Get inside and have a look at my home yourself! Everything in my study room is in a mess, even my bedroom is like it was just burglarized.”</p><p>Tang Xiu knew that he was in the wrong and let out a hollow laugh, and then hurriedly said, “Don’t worry about that, Big Brother. Let’s talk about it. The fault is mine, and your life was also affected. Thus, I’ll pay ten times the compensation for everything. If you think it’s troublesome, I’ll immediately find a repairman and also buy all the damaged things in your house.”</p><p>The middle-aged man could feel Tang Xiu’s sincerity as well as seeing his humble attitude. The anger inside him immediately vanished, and after being silent for a short while, he then slowly said, “What’s your name?”</p><p>“I’m Tang Xiu.”</p><p>The middle-aged man faintly felt that the name was familiar, but he could not remember where he had heard it. On the contrary, the woman who was currently tidying up her hair suddenly pointed to Tang Xiu and exclaimed, “I know you! You’re the famous young miracle-working doctor Tang Xiu, aren’t you? You… were you not in Star City? How come you’re in Shanghai?”</p><p>Upon hearing the reminder from his wife, the middle-aged man immediately remembered Tang Xiu’s identity, and even his thought went far beyond that.</p><p>“It turns out to be you, Brother Tang Xiu! Alas… had I known earlier who you were, I would not have acted with that attitude just now. I’ve long heard about your resounding name!” The middle-aged man laughed.</p><p>“Big Brother and Big Sis-in-law, I never thought you both would recognize me. But I really am apologizing for this incident since it has affected you both,” said Tang Xiu with a smile.</p><p>“Nevermind it.” The middle-aged man waved his hand. “It’s like we are having a fight with a stranger at first, but then turns out that we’re actually relatives. Hence, let’s cut this ceremonial talk. Besides, people said that close neighbors are better than distant relatives, no? That’s right, I forgot to introduce myself. I’m Yu Kuizeng, the chairman of Tiancheng Group, and this is my wife, Wang Xiaoyue.”</p><p>The Tiancheng Group?</p><p>Tang Xiu knew about this company, and there was only a few people in Shanghai who did not know it. The Tiancheng Group’s main business was automobile retails, after-sales, and it also engaged in sales of mechanical parts. He also learned of the legendary figures in the business world while studying economics, and this man in front of him was one of them.</p><p>Before Yu Kuizeng turned 19, he was but a poor and destitute man who worked as a maintenance worker at a dealership. Later on, he resigned from the job and set up his own small repair shop. Since he possessed good skills, was honest and upright, he was eventually able to develop his business and opened a bigger repair shop after more than two years.</p><p>Afterward, he decided to borrow a heavy loan from the bank and cooperated with several auto manufacturers that did not sell well in China. At the same time, they established three brands of auto 4S shops. Because of his sincerity and shrewdness, his business got bigger and bigger, and then came into contact with high-end car businesses about more than a decade ago.</p><p>Eventually, his business expanded and he now had at least a few billions of yuan in wealth. It was no wonder that he could afford to buy a residential house and lived in the most expensive area in China, the Tomson Villa.</p><p>“Ah, it turns out to be Big Brother Yu. I really have to blame my eyes for being unable to recognize you a while ago,” said Tang Xiu with a smile. “So to say, I read about you in some financial magazines, and also watched your interviews on TV.”</p><p>“Huh? Brother Tang knows me too?” Yu Kuizeng was astonished.</p><p>“We both are businessmen, so it’s only natural to pay more attention to other businessmen,” said Tang Xiu with a smile. “Especially you, Big Brother. You’re a successful businessman yourself, so of course I know you.”</p><p>Yu Kuizeng felt flattered and happy by Tang Xiu’s words. Though he did have billions in assets, he also knew who Tang Xiu’s identity was. This owner of the Magnificent Tang Corporation may act low-key, but he happened to have a good relationship with several wealthy people—his friends in the business world. Among them was Jin Xingkui—his brother who often mentioned this Brother Tang of his to him.</p><p>“Alright. Come come come, Brother Tang… and this one is… Anyways, let’s talk inside.”</p><p>“How do you do, Big Brother? How do you do Big Sis-in-law? My name is Xue Yu,” said Xue Yu with a smile.</p><p>“You’re so beautiful, sis-in-law. Like a fairy,” replied Wang Xiaoyue with a smile. “Brother Tang Xiu is really blessed to actually find himself such a beautiful wife like you.”</p><p>Tang Xiu did not elaborate on his relationship with Xue Yu. After entering Yu Kuizeng’s home, he first went to his study room and saw that the windstorm produced by the array turned out to have produced a much bigger might as it turned this study room in a complete mess.</p><p>Standing in front of Tang Xiu, Yu Kuizeng raised his head to look at the hole in the ceiling. He forced a wry smile and said, “Brother Tang, I can’t help but marvel about something. How did you do it? To think that you actually caused… made such a hole. You also know that my house is on the first floor!”</p><p>Before leaving downstairs, Tang Xiu had already thought about this problem and prepared an answer. So, he let out a dry chuckle and said, “The lab I just set up recently has developed a product with a special technology. This product is kind of related with the military, so I can’t disclose it as it’s a under Non-Disclosure Agreement. When I just arrived in the compound, I wanted to show it off to Xue Yu to demonstrate its power. Then, I finally remembered that I was upstairs, so…”</p><p>Yu Kuizeng’s countenance slightly changed. He did not expect that Tang Xiu had some involvement with the military, and immediately canceled the thought to ask him about it.</p><p>“Brother Yu, I hope you can help me keep this a secret. This product of technology is, after all, produced under cooperation with the military. Furthermore, the Magnificent Tang Corporation must not make it known to the public. It will be very troublesome if you ever disclose this thing out.”</p><p>“I understand. You can rest assured about that,” said Yu Kuizeng with a serious expression.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
