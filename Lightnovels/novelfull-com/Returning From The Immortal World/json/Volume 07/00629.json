He was conflicted between abandoning his conscience and not to abandon them, but he had little use for them in the future. It was precisely amid such a dilemma that Tang Xiu’s proposal came, and it made him very satisfied. He didn’t quote the price but put forward a condition instead.</p><p>“Please do say, Uncle Yuan!”</p><p>With cautiousness in mind, Tang Xiu observed him. He knew that the world did not provide free lunch. Yuan Zhengxuan was unwilling to sell and transfer the team of researchers to him, thus it could mean that the condition he put forward would be not easy to complete.</p><p>As expected, Yuan Zhengxuan smiled and said, “Tang Xiu, you have a Hand of Midas with vision and ability that are beyond that of an ordinary person’s. I need projects. I hope that I can cooperate with you in certain areas. As long as you can let me invest my money, I can give you my research institute for free along with the researchers.”</p><p>Tang Xiu slightly frowned. If he had a good project, he would have invested his money already. Why would he still wait until now? Yuan Zhengxuan’s request was therefore quite difficult for him, and for a while, he did not know how he should deal with it.</p><p>Seeing that Tang Xiu looked awkward, Yuan Zhengxuan lightly smiled, “I’m aware that asking you to give me some projects at present is unrealistic. I can hand over the laboratory and the researchers to you, and I only need your promise now.”</p><p>After contemplating a bit, Tang Xiu said, “I don’t dare to guarantee 100%. But if I have a business plan and come across some good projects that require me to cooperate with others later I will call you first, Uncle Yuan.”</p><p>Clapping his hands, Yuan Zhengxuan smiled with satisfaction. “It’s a deal. This way, the researchers who are now going home to celebrate the New Year will return to work at the research institute afterward. Let’s set a date and I’ll take you there myself by then.”</p><p>“Alright.” Tang Xiu smiled and nodded.</p><p>As a matter of fact, he also lacked the confidence in researching the Magnetic Levitation Flying Disk. After all, the subject of science and technology research was something out of his expertise. The reason why he wanted to start the research was that he had already seen the object. He knew how huge the sensation it would create and how wondrous the profits it would make once the object was fully researched and developed.</p><p>Ring ring ring…</p><p>The ringtone of Tang Xiu’s mobile phone suddenly buzzed.</p><p>After picking it up and looking at the number displayed on the screen, Tang Xiu immediately connected it and spoke, “Have you returned to Star City, Sis Xiaowan?”</p><p>“Yeah, I’m already here.” Chen Xiaowan’s voice came replying. “Where are you now? Are you free and have some time to go out and meet me?”</p><p>“I still have things to tend to right now. I’ll treat you to lunch at noon,” said Tang Xiu with a smile.</p><p>“Okay!” Chen Xiaowan readily agreed.</p><p>After ending the call, Tang Xiu looked at Yuan Zhengxuan and spoke, “Uncle Yuan, please don’t forget to call me after the researchers come to work again after the New Year. I’ll still be in Star City before the 15th of January.”</p><p>“Got it. No problem,” said Yuan Zhengxuan with a smile.</p><p>Shortly after, Tang Xiu got up and bade farewell. Though Yuan Zhengxuan and Zhao Jing wanted him to stay for lunch, Tang Xiu refused since he already had an appointment with Chen Xiaowan. Yuan Chuling didn’t go with him as he had just returned from Shanghai and had planned to stay at home with his parents. He was obviously more mature than before after having gone through many things, much to his parents’ happiness and satisfaction.</p><p>However, on the way to see Chen Xiaowan, Tang Xiu received a call from Su Ben and learned that a big incident had happened, so he immediately contacted Chen Xiaowan and told her that he had to go to his hometown as there was a very urgent matter. After concluding the call, he directly turned the steering wheel and rushed to his hometown.</p><p>Su Ben told him on the phone that several murder cases happened in the Su Family Village as well as in the neighboring villages in the recent days. According to the investigation of the local public security bureau, it was found that the murderers were not humans but very horrible beasts.</p><p>Such a situation made Tang Xiu remember what Su Ben told him, that in the back hill of the Su Family Village there was a leopard larger than a bull. At that time, Tang Xiu’s conjecture was that the beast should be a savage, fierce beast, and he did not deal with it since he did not encounter it before.</p><p>****</p><p>Su Family Village, Songlou Town.</p><p>It was nearly the New Year and at this time, the whole village portrayed a jubilant scene. Children dressed in clean clothes were running around, setting off firecrackers, sticking and pasting couplets, and playing games, whereas the adults were preparing for the New Year’s products or gathered together in groups of three to five to chat.</p><p>When Tang Xiu drove the car to the village, however, only a few men came back from the outside holding iron shovels and harpoons in their hands, with solemn and vigilant expressions on their faces.</p><p>Creak…</p><p>As the car stopped in front of them, Tang Xiu then faced them and asked, “How is the current situation? How many people have been killed in the Su Family Village?”</p><p>One of the men was among the ones that was helped by Tang Xiu in the previous beating incidents and was sent to the Star City Chinese Medical Hospital, Su Xiangjian. Upon hearing Tang Xiu’s inquiry, he squeezed out a sad smile and said, “Two died, Zhangwen and Gangzi. The day when that beast killed them, hundreds of people from several villages joined us to scour the mountain, but we couldn’t find its shadow at all. We really want to kill it.” [1]</p><p>“How many villagers from other villages became victims?” Asked Tang Xiu quickly.</p><p>“Two people from our village. A total of four added up with the ones from other villages. The number now became six victims, with several others injured. Wang Haiyang from the Little Village of Wang is gravely injured and maybe won’t be able to make through this year.”</p><p>“Which places the beast attacked them?” Asked Tang Xiu once again.</p><p>While pointing to the north, Su Xiangjian bitterly said, “Some from our village were attacked in the orchard at the foot of the hill. They were pruning apple trees back then and were attacked by that damned beast. The victims from other villages were also attacked near the mountain at the back. The man who survived said that it was a leopard the size of a bull.”</p><p>Tang Xiu nodded in response. He took out cigarettes from his pocket and gave it to them. Then he talked to them for a while before driving to his grandmother’s house.</p><p>\"Tang Xiu!\"</p><p>Su Ben and Su Quan were long waiting and rushed up to welcome him at this time.</p><p>After Tang Xiu got off the car, he said, “I met the uncles when I just entered the village and learned the situation from them. Brother Ben, Su Quan, wait for me here. I’m going in and say hi to grandma, and then you all will go with me to the back of the mountain.</p><p>“We can’t go there, Tang Xiu,” said Su Ben quickly.</p><p>Tang Xiu shot him a deep gaze and said with a serious expression, “Brother Ben, there’s something that you don’t know. I’ve been practicing martial arts with some experts in the recent years, and I can tell you that my foundation is very deep; tens of men are not my opponents. Besides, with you all following me, we can kill that leopard as long as we can find it.”</p><p>“Listen to me, Tang Xiu. That leopard is no way an ordinary wild beast.” Su Ben shook his head and replied. “And now many people even say that this leopard is something akin to a demon spawn. Let alone three of us, even 30 people going there without weapons will probably not come back alive.”</p><p>Tang Xiu was silent for a moment before speaking, “Just wait for me here first, I’ll tell you something later.”</p><p>Having said that, he stepped into the courtyard’s entrance and then saw Su Xiangfei, who was currently whetting a javelin in the yard. Tang Xiu was slightly dazed upon seeing it and immediately asked, “When did you come back?”</p><p>Squeezing a smiling face, Su Xiangfei said, “Been back here for more than a week.”</p><p>Tang Xiu nodded and asked, “Is Grandma inside?”</p><p>“She’s inside, having a nap after lunch.” Su Xiangfei said. “Grandma has been great recently, though she’s kinda sad due to the death of the villagers. She’s in a bad mood these days.”</p><p>Tang Xiu then nodded, “Since she’s sleeping, then I’m going out to deal with something.”</p><p>“I’m coming with you,” said Su Xiangfei quickly. “I just heard your conversation outside.”</p><p>“With me, Brother Ben, and Su Quan, the three of us are enough.” Tang Xiu shook his head. “Don’t worry, it will be fine.”</p><p>“Another one will add more strength, Tang Xiu.” Su Xiangfei shook his head. “I must go with you all.”</p><p>Tang Xiu hesitated. After looking at his determined expression, he then nodded and said, “Alright, let’s go!”</p><p>As he came outside, Tang Xiu took out a pistol from his pocket, showed it under the light toward them and then quickly stuffed it back, speaking in a low voice, “This gun is usually for my self-defense. When we get to the back of the mountain, once we find the leopard and are unable to kill it by our own force, then I’ll shoot it.”</p><p>“Tang Xiu, you… how come you have a gun?” Asked Su Quan immediately, astounded.</p><p>The pistol was actually obtained by Tang Xiu after he killed the members of the Yao Family. There were quite a number of guns inside his interspatial ring, and even some submachine guns and sniper rifles. Certainly, he couldn’t mention it to them about it, and therefore made up some reasons, “I’m a billion-yuan Big Boss. It would be quite dangerous if I didn’t have the means to defend myself whenever some evil people want to strike me for money. Anyhow, rest assured, I won’t do anything illegal with this gun. It’s just to defend myself.”</p><p>Both Su Ben and Su Quan immediately understood since both of them were employees of the Magnificent Tang Corporation. Su Ben was now a deputy captain of the security guards in the company’s winery and naturally knew that the security team of the company was now armed with guns legally licensed by the government. Su Xiangfei, however, did not know about this. But after realizing Tang Xiu’s present status, he also expressed his understanding.</p><p>Ten minutes later, after Tang Xiu drove the car and parked it in the back hill with the three people, they hurriedly got up and trekked the mountain pathway leading to the mountain with vigilance. Except for Tang Xiu who brought a gun, Su Ben and Su Quan brought a harpoon and an iron shovel, whereas Su Xiangfei was armed with his javelin.</p><p>The moment they entered the Jin Mountain, Tang Xiu had already released his spiritual sense. Though his present level of cultivation was very high, he did not find the level of strength of that leopard. Furthermore, he had three people with him around, so he needed to guarantee their safety as well.</p><p>“Give me some directions. I often came here when we’re children, but my memory is kinda blurred about the many places,” said Tang Xiu to them. It was actually his real purpose of bringing them.</p><p>“Let’s scour the surroundings first.” Su Ben said. “We’ll venture deeper if we can’t find it. Many places are fraught with dangers over this mountain, especially in the valley. I’m quite familiar with those places, just follow me.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
