He never dreamed that his powerful big brother would be defeated, more so that it was a thorough defeat without being able to fight back at all.</p><p>“Brother…”</p><p>“SHUT THE HELL UP!” Du Yunlong yelled. “This damned thing ends here.”</p><p>Du Yunjie turned his head in fright and looked at Tang Xiu with fear before nodding silently. Even though he really wasn’t reconciled, he had no choice but to lower his head since he didn’t want to die yet. He realized that today’s incident would be spread throughout the social circles of the influential people of Blue City, and even his family would severely punish him.</p><p>And yet, he must admit that his ability was far inferior to the other’s!</p><p>Without sparing a mind to Du Yunjie, Tang Xiu sat back on the sofa and smilingly said, “Your injury is very heavy, but it’s just a small punishment for your own initiative to take the place of your little brother. Go back, rest for a few months and you’ll recover.”</p><p>At this moment, Du Yunlong had sobered up and realized that Tang Xiu was probably a cultivator as well, and therefore had no resentment toward him. He cupped his fists and said, “Friend, I admit that you’re very formidable at present, but give me some time and I believe I will surpass and defeat you one day if I cultivate diligently.”</p><p>“Having confidence is indeed good and all, but don’t let your little brother come out and incite trouble again.” Tang Xiu smiled. “I held back this time since I appreciate your character, else it would have been impossible for you to go back tonight.”</p><p>With an accepting expression, Du Yunlong immediately cupped his fists and replied, “Rest assured, there will never be a second time.”</p><p>The conflict finally concluded after Du Yunlong was badly beaten by Tang Xiu. Under Huang Xu and Wang Zidong’s humble invitations, Tang Xiu and Long Zhongyu were invited to the Supreme Hall while the Du Brothers left in a mess. As for the matter in dealing with the aftermath of A’ Qiang’s dead body and the severely injured thugs of Blue City, this was handled by Du Yunlong.</p><p>Inside the Mercedes-Benz outside the building, Shao Mingzhen slowly opened his eyes. As his vision saw through the window and fell on Du Yunlong, his expression changed slightly. He immediately opened the car’s door and said in a heavy tone, “Are you injured?”</p><p>Du Yunlong was propped up by his men and replied with a bitter expression, “I lost and was seriously injured. It will take a few months for me to recover.”</p><p>“Everyone else, leave!” Said Shao Mingzhen all of a sudden after being silent for a while.</p><p>In just a minute, everyone including Du Yunjie had gone away, leaving only Shao Mingzhen and Du Yunlong at the entrance. Following which, Shao Mingzhen asked in a deep tone, “Is that person also a cultivator? What is his origin?”</p><p>“He is, but I don’t know his origin,” said Du Yunlong bitterly. “He’s very strong, and the combat between us was simply a one-sided one. I… I didn’t even have a chance to fight back.”</p><p>Shao Mingzhen’s pupils suddenly contracted. He thought for a short while before firmly speaking, “I can’t stand by since this incident involves another cultivator. Let’s go! Take me to see this man. I really want to know how capable this man is.”</p><p>“Master, the conflict between my little brother and them has been concluded already,” said Du Yunlong quickly. “At that time inside, Huang Xu also hinted me and if my guess I correct, that person should come from Beijing.”</p><p>Someone from the capital?</p><p>Shao Mingzhen was silent for a while and then said, “I see what you mean. I’m not going to avenge you. But that cultivator has a very strong character and overbearingness. I’m afraid he still harbors resentment inside, so I need to see him and completely solve this incident.”</p><p>“I’ll take you there, then,” said Du Yunlong immediately after hearing it.</p><p>Inside the Supreme Hall.</p><p>While sitting and smoking a cigarette, Tang Xiu looked at Huang Xu who was currently clumsily making tea. There was a faint smile on his handsome face as he didn’t even blame Huang Xu at all for today’s incident. He even thought that this guy was quite good except for his lasciviousness. In particular, he stepped forward to stand in front of him, blocking the gun pointed at him by A’ Qiang, an action that moved and made Tang Xiu acknowledge him.</p><p>Creak… The box’s door was pushed open from the outside.</p><p>When Tang Xiu saw Du Yunlong coming in, he couldn’t help but furrow his brows. But after seeing Shao Mingzhen behind him, his furrowed brows stretched out, replaced with a strange expression.</p><p>After Shao Mingzhen walked into the box and took saw the people inside, he looked slightly stunned before his expression turned into a look of being at a loss whether to cry or laugh. He turned to Du Yunlong, pointed at Tang Xiu and asked, “Was the one who injured you that person?”</p><p>“Yeah. It’s him, Master,” said Du Yunlong.</p><p>Shao Mingzhen raised his hand and sent a gentle slap on his head, and the scolded him, “You really have a good luck and good fate, you damn stupid brat! It was very lucky for you to come across him. I would have bagged your dead body had you bumped into someone else.”</p><p>Du Yunlong was dumbfounded. Judging from the words spoken by his Master, could it be that he and the other party knew each other?</p><p>Shao Mingzhen shook his head and let out a wry smile. Then he walked toward Tang Xiu and said, “Brother Tang, today’s incident is really akin to having a conflict with a stranger only to know that each turns out to be close people, no? Anyways, for a broad minded man like you, you need not stoop down to the level of this ignorant second disciple of mine, right?”</p><p>Tang Xiu let out a smile as he got up and then walked over to hug Shao Mingzhen. Then he smiled and said, “I never thought he was your disciple, Old Brother Shao. Your eyes are good, nevertheless, since this kid has a good character—not a bad pick for your disciple, I admit.”</p><p>After saying that, he stuffed his hand into his pockets and secretly took out a porcelain bottle from his interspatial ring, and then threw it to Du Yunlong, saying, “I should give you a gift for our first meeting since you are Old Bro Shao’s disciple. We just had a small misunderstanding before, so accept this bottle of Holy Healing medicine! Your injury should be healed within three days at the most.”</p><p>I’ll be able to recover in three days?</p><p>Du Yunlong’s expression was dazed before it  was immediately replaced with excitement.</p><p>Tang Xiu’s action was very much to Shao Mingzhen’s satisfaction, so he smiled and said, “Brother Tang, a while ago I was quite curious about the identity of the man who was unexpectedly able to injure Yunlong, so I came here to see him. Never thought that I would meet you here because of this. Anyways, other than tending to a private affair in Blue City this time, I also planned to visit Star City to have a few drinks with you.”</p><p>Long Zhengyu at the side then joined in the chat and said with a smile, “Uncle Shao, I must accompany you to have a few drinks, too!”</p><p>“Sure.” Shao Mingzhen smiled. “By the way, how has your father been, Zhengyu? I have a hunch that your Dad should be keeping a watch here in Blue City to make some money!”</p><p>“He’s been great.” Long Zhengyu smiled. “He often mentions you, Uncle Shao, and also Uncle Miao. Kinda missing the days that you shared some drinks with both of you.”</p><p>“Hahaha.” Shao Mingzhen laughed. “No worries, I’ll go find him in the near future.”</p><p>At the side, Huang Xu and Wang Zidong had their eyes widened. Never once had they ever dreamed that Tang Xiu would be acquainted with Du Yunlong’s Master, more so that their relationship seemed very close as well. But, why would Tang Xiu and Shao Mingzhen address each other as brothers, whereas Long Zhengyu must address him as Uncle Shao?</p><p>The duo exchanged looks. Then, Huang Xu stood up and smilingly said, “Brother Tang Xiu, Zhengyu, since everyone is acquaintances, I’ll tell the waiters to bring the dishes and drinks here. Running across each other by chance is also a reunion. Regardless, I must display my hospitality as a host here since I’m the owner.”</p><p>Immediately after, Du Yunlong introduced Huang Xu and Wang Zidong to Shao Mingzhen. After everyone’s introductions were done, they tasted the dishes and drank the wine while talking about various topics in a harmonious atmosphere.</p><p>After three rounds of wine, Shao Mingzhen and Tang Xiu made an appointment to meet again tomorrow, as the former then left with Du Yunlong. Huang Xu, however, personally booked two suite in the club and invited Tang Xiu and Long Zhengyu to stay there.</p><p>****</p><p>On a road with unceasing streams of traffic, a Mercedes-Benz was moving fast. Inside the car, Du Yunlong’s bluish and swollen face looked a bit puzzled. Many times he wanted to ask to clear the matter that puzzled him but swallowed back all the words he wanted to say each time.</p><p>“Just ask whatever you have in mind!”</p><p>Shao Mingzhen took his eyes back from the window and glanced at him.</p><p>Finally, Du Yunlong asked, “Master, what exactly is Tang Xiu’s identity? He should be of the same age as me, but how come he has such a formidable strength?”</p><p>“His identity is quite mixed and complicated,” replied Shao Mingzhen with a sigh. “What I know so far is probably only the tip of the iceberg, but even that is enough for me to have the intention of showing my goodwill to get close to him. Do you remember when I told you about the purpose of my trip to Blue City? The person I wish to be at friendly terms with is exactly him… Tang Xiu.”</p><p>Du Yunlong’s eyes stared wide as he said with a flabbergasted expression, “What exactly is his identity to actually make him deserve Master’s…”</p><p>“You know, the first time I met him his strength was not even as good as yours now,” said Shao Mingzhen with a forced smile. “Yet now, his strength may have surpassed mine… in just over half a year. As for his identity, I will tell you now! Do you know the Magnificent Tang Corporation? He’s the secret Big Boss behind this company.”</p><p>Du Yunlong was shocked.</p><p>“Tang Xiu is a member of the Tang Family from Beijing.” Shao Mingzhen continued. “According to the news I got, Dongbei Hu—the Amur Tiger was killed by him, and the main actor who ruined the Yao Family of Beijing who is now destitute is also him.”</p><p>Hiss…</p><p>While gasping cold air, Du Yunlong felt secretly fortunate inside for not completely offending Tang Xiu today, or else his Du Family may have…</p><p>Suddenly, Shao Mingzhen’s expression became gravely solemn and the tone of his voice turned heavy he spoke again, “What I just told you are only Tang Xiu’s ordinary identities. There’s another identity—the Everlasting Feast Hall’s Master. I never told you the existence of the Everlasting Feast Hall before since I was afraid that it would produce a diversion inside your mind and give birth to a bad idea during your cultivation processing, but I must tell you about it now. The Everlasting Feast Hall is a very terrifying force. In the case that you encounter someone from the Everlasting Feast Hall, you must only make friends with them and never become enemies!”</p><p>“Master, what exactly is the terrifying aspect of this Everlasting Feast Hall?” Asked Du Yunlong hastily.</p><p>“No one has been able to clearly find out the strength the Everlasting Feast Hall possesses until now,” sighed Shao Mingzhen spookily. “And nobody knows how many cultivators the Everlasting Feast Hall has.”</p><p>Du Yunlong’s body was trembling as he felt a chill inside his heart. With such a fearful force, wasn’t it the same as no family having a chance to be placed on par with it? Cultivators absolutely possessed dreadful and abnormal strength, and if the Everlasting Feast Hall had a lot of them, then it…</p><p>In a flash, Du Yunlong came to a realization: Tang Xiu was the owner and the Master of the Everlasting Feast Hall.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
