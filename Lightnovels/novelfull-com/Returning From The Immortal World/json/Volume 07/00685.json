He was a bit stunned when he heard Tang Xiu’s words and immediately couldn’t help but laugh, “Hahaha, you’re joking me, Brother Tang. I would have become the United Nations chairman if I had such ability. Who could be running his mouth making such a joke in front of you?”</p><p>Upon seeing Zhang Zitao gulp down, the smile on Tang Xiu’s face turned a bit wider as he said, “Other than your treasured son, who else dares to run his mouth like that? If anything, it’s not like I don’t dare to go to the dinner hosted by you and Brother Gu, but it’s because I can’t go! Your son is blocking me at the entrance of Shanghai University with his hardcore brothers, threatening to thrash me up by relying on their identity as local snakes. Honestly, I’m really afraid now!”</p><p>Zhang Yueming’s expression instantly turned very splendid.</p><p>Threatening Tang Xiu?</p><p>A chill ran down Zhang Yueming’s spine as he recalled Tang Xiu’s methods. Never once did he ever dream that his bastard son would provoke Tang Xiu one day.</p><p>“This should be a misunderstanding. All of them! Brother Tang, slap him if that little bastard disrespects you and let him know that he must respect his elders. The day has ended, so just wait there, I’ll come over now.”</p><p>Hearing the tension and nervousness in Zhang Yueming’s voice, Tang Xiu immediately chuckled and said, “No need for that, Brother Zhang. This treasured son of yours is also listening at the side! How about you speak to him on the phone?”</p><p>“This… alright!” Zhang Yueming scrunched up before finally replying.</p><p>An alarmed and scared expression was all over Zhang Zitao’s face as he watched Tang Xiu cautiously. He first bowed to Tang Xiu under the public’s eyes before receiving the mobile phone, and then said with a bitter tone, “Dad, I’m really sorry. I heard Song Zicong mentioning Tang Xiu’s name, and though I often heard the name from you, I never thought that he would be Tang… ugh, Uncle Tang who often hangs out with you. Even if someone gave me 100 times more guts I wouldn’t have dared to involve myself in this matter if I knew it was him!”</p><p>After hearing his son’s explanation, Zhang Yueming immediately cussed, “You damn good-for-nothing shit! Do you think if it was not Brother Tang you could still run amok and bully others? Apologize to your Uncle Tang sincerely and wholeheartedly! You damn bastard, rather than learning to do good deeds you just hang around with your rabble friends all day long. You’ll see how I will teach you a lesson when you get back!”</p><p>Zhang Zitao’s expression turned nasty. He was afraid of no one but his own father. What he said was true, nonetheless. Though he heard Song Zicong mentioning Tang Xiu’s name several times, it never crossed his mind that the owner of this name turned out to be the same one he heard many times from his father in the last six months!</p><p>“I’ll apologize to him right away, Dad!”</p><p>He did not hang up the call but took the mobile and gave it back to Tang Xiu as he bowed and spoke, “Uncle Tang, I did not expect that I would disrespect you due to my ignorance. Magnanimous as you are, please don’t stoop down to my level of ignorance since I know that I was wrong. You can hit me if you haven’t vented your anger yet.”</p><p>At the side, the sudden change shocked Song Zicong; he was utterly dumbfounded by the 180-degree reversal. His heartbeat increased all of a sudden and a chill ran down his bones. He was very clear about how powerful the Zhang Family was being one of the prominent and powerful influences in Shanghai, and yet… how… how did Zhang Zitao suddenly become so docile in front of Tang Xiu?</p><p>Other than that, Zhang Yueming seemed to be anxious and intense, as if this guy was someone of extraordinary status or something.</p><p>He… what kind of terrifying background did this fella have? To think that even such an influential figure like Zhang Yueming dreaded him?</p><p>Upon thinking up to there, regret suddenly filled his heart, regretting not fully investigating Tang Xiu earlier.</p><p>While looking at Zhang Zitao, who was sincerely apologizing, the way he addressed him, “Uncle Tang”, rang loudly in his mind. Isn’t he at the same age as Zhang Zitao? How can he unexpectedly become a generation higher?</p><p>Tang Xiu slowly raised his hand while looking at his pale complexion, as patted his shoulder gently and lightly said, “Many second generation nouveau riches and the sons of government officials act immature because they never know how to act low profile and eventually court a calamity upon their family, implicating their entire clans. And you! You had better cultivate some conscience later. You’re no longer an adolescence, so it’s time for you to grow up already. Anyways, let’s end this matter here, shall we?”</p><p>With that said, he took back his mobile phone and smilingly said, “Anyways, Brother Zhang, a tiger father never begets a dog son. I believe your son can be someone great in the future, but you must educate him well, and you had better spend some time teaching him some conscience!”</p><p>Zhang Yueming, who just heard the apology from his son, let out a hollow laugh after hearing Tang Xiu’s words and said, “It’s my fault for neglecting him, Brother Tang! I was too busy tending to many affairs in the business, so I have less time to correct and discipline this child, Zitong. But rest assured that I will discipline him well in the future and strive to make him mature early, so he’ll be capable to take my mantle and let me have a relaxed life afterwards.”</p><p>“Alright!” Tang Xiu smiled. “In that case, I’ll go find you and Brother Gu to have a meal.”</p><p>After hanging up the phone, Tang Xiu looked at Song Zicong and found that the guy had his head lowered at this moment. He then shook his head and said, “Your name is Song Zicong, right? I don’t care who your Dad is, neither do I care how much power your family has. Just remember my words: if you really like a woman sincerely, show that woman your sincere attitude to impress her and melt her heart with your love. Treating your love rival with threats is just simply stupid. Get out of the way now, will you? Don’t be such an eyesore in front of me.”</p><p>Song Zicong looked up and wanted to say something. But when he saw the indifference in Tang Xiu’s expression, he swallowed back what he wanted to say. Though his Song Family was stronger than the Zhangs, he too felt that the sentence just said by Tang Xiu before was principally correct, that he must not court a disaster for his family so as not to implicate his entire clan.</p><p>After all, he had not yet figured out this guy’s identity until now!</p><p>Not far away, the other two young men who were previously looking at the scene and treated it like a joke while hugging girls were now thoroughly dumbfounded. They didn’t even realize when Song Zicong and Zhang Zitao approached them. The three girls, however, had their eyes lit up and watched Tang Xiu with curious expressions and admiration.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>While feeling hazed inwardly, Zhang Zitao immediately shouted in a low voice upon finding that his two friends were staring blankly like that. He had long wanted to know Tang Xiu but never had a chance to do so. Now that he met him, he turned out to have offended the guy, making him rain down curses at Song Zicong.</p><p>As the four luxurious supercars left, Tang Xiu patted Xue Chao, who was stunned and dumbfounded, and said with a smile, “Look, I’m sure Yue Kai and the others will be starving if we don’t go to the restaurant now.”</p><p>Xue Chao snapped back to his senses and spoke with a face full of admiration, “You’re really flamboyant, Boss Tang! Those arrogant and bluffering guys riding those extravagant supercars were unexpectedly turned docile and got packed up by you! That Zhang… Zhang Zitao, are you really his Uncle? But why did he not know you at all?”</p><p>Tang Xiu could not help but burst into laughter and said, “Let me tell you an analogy. How will you address your Dad’s friend if you met him?”</p><p>“Young Uncle or Big Uncle!” Replied Xue Chao.</p><p>“Hold it. That’s not exactly the case.” Tang Xiu nodded. “I have a good relationship with Zhang Zitao’s Dad, now tell me, how should his son address me?”</p><p>Xue Chao patted his own forehead and said awkwardly, “Man, what a hog brain I have. I never thought of such a question before. Anyways, let’s just go have a bite.”</p><p>Propitious Restaurant.</p><p>It was an ordinary restaurant near Shanghai University with no specialties, and yet there were two traits that turned it quite popular among the many students of Shanghai University. That was, the meal was fulfilling as well as affordable. Yue Kai and the others often came here whenever Tang Xiu was not with them.</p><p>When Tang Xiu and Xue Chao arrived there, they found that Yue Kai and Hu Qingsong had not yet arrived. After some thinking, he then called Mu Wanying and learned that she had just finished her class and was about to head to the cafeteria with her several dorm sisters to have a meal, thus he immediately invited them to eat together.</p><p>Soon after, Yue Kai, Hu Qingsong, and Zhao Liang caught up, followed by Mu Wanying and her three dorm sisters. After some merry talk, everyone wolfed down their meals, leaving only leftovers on the table, then all of them went back to the campus since they still had a class in the afternoon.</p><p>“We’ll go to the classroom first.”</p><p>With a weird expression, Jiang Feiyan winked at Mu Wanying and then looked at Tang Xiu teasingly. She then dragged Li Xinjie and Hu Wei away, whereas Yue Kai and Hu Qingsong’s group also blew a whistle and walked toward the classroom building.</p><p>Mu Wanying herself had been worried about Tang Xiu. Now that she saw him arriving in Shanghai safe and sound, the knot in her heart finally eased. At present, there were only the two of them, so she gently pulled Tang Xiu’s arm and asked in a low voice, “Has your things in the Western Region been solved?”</p><p>“All solved. Relax!” Tang Xiu nodded.</p><p>“Anyways, I wanna go to my company tomorrow, care to accompany me?” Asked Mu Wanying in a whisper, yet there was hesitation on her face.</p><p>Seeing the anticipation on her face, Tang Xiu hesitated for a moment before he nodded and said, “Alright, I’ll accompany you! It just so happens that I have no class tomorrow.”</p><p>Mu Wanying’s expression turned joyful, and the smile on her face turned brighter. She then left after chatting a little with Tang Xiu. As for the latter, Yue Kai and the others naturally teased him for a good long while after he came to the classroom.</p><p>The two classes in the afternoon ended in a very relaxed manner. Tang Xiu did not follow Yue Kai back to the dormitory but directly left the campus to return to Bluestar Villa Complex. He received a message from Mo Awu when he was in class that the power generator had been shipped to Shanghai and had now been moved into his villa.</p><p>Tempering the body using electricity generated by a power generator was a method Tang Xiu had thought of. He had yet to conduct an experiment on it until now, so he was anticipating to try it on himself. If it worked well, it would definitely become an important subject for his men’s training.</p><p>However, what surprised him was that he saw an unexpected guest even before he entered his house. Tang Xiu got a bit of a headache after seeing him and if he could, he really did not want to see this person.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
