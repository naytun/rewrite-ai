After more than ten seconds in silence, only then did he slowly ask, “Who exactly is your Ancestress?”</p><p>Xue Yu gently raised her hand to uncover her veil. As the face of a woman that could topple a kingdom appeared in front of Tang Xiu, she then said with a slight smile, “That Old Ancestress of mine is someone blind who also comes from Miao Region like me. She knows the matter of the ancient as well as the present and walks on the path of life divination.”</p><p>Startled, Tang Xiu asked with an astounded expression, “Old Blind has neither sons nor daughters, I believe. There’s no way she has any family member whatsoever, no?”</p><p>“There are reasons why we address her as our Ancestress. It’s not because we are related by blood.” Xue Yu shook her head and said with a smile. “The Ancestress was fated to have fate claim her husband and halt her marriage, thus she naturally has no sons or daughters. However, she is actually the patron saint as well as the oldest elder for us, the Miao people. So, all the clans and tribes of the Miao People address her as Ancestress.”</p><p>Tang Xiu understood in a flash. He then touched his nose and helplessly said, “You Ancestress is kind of listening to my commands, so shouldn’t you listen to my command as well?”</p><p>A cunning light flashed in Xue Yu’s eyes as she smilingly replied, “I can obey everything you order me to do other than the ancestor’s custom that must not be changed. We, the Miao, have an ancient saying that our woman must stay faithful and content with the man she has married with. You are my future husband, thus I’ll do whatever you ask me.”</p><p>“Knock it off!”</p><p>Tang Xiu felt like he was stuck with the gum he chewed, and quickly said, “Rules are dead, but people are living! That custom passed down by your Ancestress need to be broken by the later generations. Miss Xue, I already have a girlfriend and we also have an excellent relationship, and with me taking you up as per your condition, do you really want to be a third person between us? Besides, I do think that Chu Yuan is the most suitable candidate for you.”</p><p>“No, I don’t think he is.” Xue Yu shook her head.</p><p>With that said, she slowly took out a small porcelain bottle and poured out a black pill from it, saying, “I only have two choices if you don’t want to accept me as per the custom of my clan. First is to kill you, and second is to commit suicide. I know your identity, thus I don’t think I can kill you. So the only choice I have is the last one: commit suicide.”</p><p>“If you wanna die, then do it yourself,” said Tang Xiu with a frown.</p><p>Xue Yu’s eyes turned dark and her jade-like hand straightly threw the pill into her mouth, and then slowly closed her eyes at this moment.</p><p>Tang Xiu was dumbfounded. He had already identified the efficacy of the black pill through its smell; it was definitely a highly poisonous pill. Let alone an ordinary person, even a cultivator with a low-level cultivation would die if he took it.</p><p>Bam…</p><p>His palm patted Xue Yu’s chest. Though he could feel the plump and supple sensation from it, there was no evil in his mind. As his Primal Chaos Force entered Xue Yu’s body, it wrapped and controlled the black pill that was about to melt in just half a second. Meanwhile, his hand pressed Xue Yu’s cheek and forced the black pill out of her mouth.</p><p>“Stupid!” Scolded Tang Xiu coldly.</p><p>Xue Yu opened her eyes, but her eyes were still dead. She shook her head and said, “You can save me once, but you can’t save me every time. I will die unless you promise to marry me.”</p><p>Tang Xiu fell silent. After releasing Xue Yu’s cheek, he thought for a few minutes before he slowly said, “I don’t have a way to make change the custom of your clan, but that Old Blind should be able to, shouldn’t she? You address her as Ancestress, so you should listen to her words.”</p><p>“Ancestress told me personally before I came here that I would only be able to live normally if a certain honorable man were to help me. And she said that man is you. Also, she wanted me to convey a message to you. She said that she wouldn’t appear before you again even if you are to burn three incenses, and she will meet you again later only on June this year in Shanghai’s Everlasting Feast Hall.”</p><p>“This Old Blind!”</p><p>Tang Xiu was flustered and exasperated, for he did not expect that Old Blind had already predicted that he would look for her and had unexpectedly prevented him to do so ahead of time. Suddenly, his expression slightly moved and faintly said, “I already have a girlfriend, thus it’s utterly impossible to dump her just to marry you. Since you are the one who is weeping and wanting me to marry you, then you’ll only be my lover! Or a mistress.”</p><p>Xue Yu stared blankly, then a look of shame and anger flashed in her eyes for a moment, and yet, she kept silent for a long while before she nodded with an unsightly expression and said, “I will become your lover without legal certificate and recognition, but you have to go with me to the Miao region and hold a matrimony ceremony to marry me.”</p><p>“You agreed with you becoming a lover and even a mistress?” Asked Tang Xiu in anger. “Did your brain get fried or something?”</p><p>“To live is better than to die,” said Xue Yu honestly. “I’m still young, I don’t want to die yet. Besides, it’s not like the polyandry and polygamy practices do not exist among the clans and tribes in the Miao Region, to begin with. There was also a custom in ancient times that a man can have three wives and four concubines, so I can accept this.”</p><p>“Holy shit!” Tang Xiu was truly rendered speechless and was utterly defeated by Xue Yu without any argument to refute her.</p><p>He had seen this practice of having three wives and four concubines way too much in the Immortal World, since numerous Immortal hegemons there had numerous Immortal partners and mistresses. Even among the ordinary people, particularly those empire royalties, the Emperor also had seven palaces and six manors to house seventy-two concubines, while the number of princes and nobilities who had more wives and concubines was also too many to count. It was to the extent that a man having a lot of women was considered as proof of his ability in some countries.</p><p>However, this place is the Earth, for God’s sake!</p><p>More so that this is the 21st century. Such an anamnesis of feudalism is terribly appalling, that even a woman such as Xue Yu is not exempted from such custom!</p><p>Only when the plane took off did Tang Xiu turn his head to Xue Yu and said, “I don’t care whatever you’re thinking. Since you want to be my lover, then don’t affect my normal life, and there is no way the others can find out about our relationship either. I’ll give you a house to live after we arrive in Shanghai, and unless I take the initiative to contact you, then you are not allowed to do so. Of course, if you want to leave me after you’ve thought it through, you can just leave straightly without calling me.”</p><p>“No problem.” Xue Yu nodded.</p><p>Tang Xiu still wanted to admonish her, but immediately lost the intention to do so upon seeing her cold expression. He did not want to pay attention to her again, so he closed his eyes and slept.</p><p>Shanghai Airport.</p><p>Right as Tang Xiu led Mo Awu and Xue Yu out of the airport exit, Chi Nan, who had received a call from Mo Awu earlier, was waiting for them outside.</p><p>“It’s been laborious on you, Boss.”</p><p>Chi Nan looked energetic, and she looked several years younger than the first time Tang Xiu met her. Her appearance looked like she was twenty-seven-plus years old, and even her looks and figure looked more alluring and attractive than before,</p><p>“Not bad. You seem to have gotten a lot of cultivation resources.” Tang Xiu nodded. “However, do not take too many medicinal pills or elixirs, and it’s best for you to cultivate diligently to lay a solid foundation. Else, you’ll get obsessed and deviate if your cultivation rapidly enhances.”</p><p>With a change in expression, Chi Nan immediately replied seriously, “Understood, this subordinate will remember it.”</p><p>Tang Xiu did not speak anymore and followed her to the parking lot outside, boarded the car, and then directly headed to Bluestar Villa Complex. After Chi Nan left, he then looked at Xue Yu and faintly said, “The first floor has a lot of rooms, pick one of them. I’ll take you to your new residence tomorrow.”</p><p>“But I want to stay together with you,” asked Xue Yu.</p><p>“The number of times we met is less than the fingers on my hand, you know!” Said Tang Xiu with an annoyed expression. “Do you think living together with me now is the appropriate thing to do? Even if we do become lovers, everything must move forward gradually and normally to cultivate the affection between each other, no?”</p><p>“It’s exactly because we are lovers that desire should be more important than feelings.” Xue Yu shook her head. “Also, I don’t feel secure at all if you don’t want my body.”</p><p>“What absurdity!”</p><p>Tang Xiu had not the slightest desire toward Xue Yu’s body now. He just slated her in a low voice and then turned around to head to the second floor. As for Mo Awu, though it was his first time visiting the place, he seemed to be quite familiar with the house and soon picked a room.</p><p>On the second floor.</p><p>Just as Tang Xiu entered his bedroom and shot a look at Xue Yu who followed him behind, he was immediately at a loss whether he had to cry or laugh and said, “Tell me something, Jade Beauty, is there a need to be so adamant in clinging to me? Just let me relax for a while after the long travel, will you? Just a few days. Yeah, it’s been a few days. You, a woman, also have several uncomfortable days every month, whereas I, as a man, also need to take a breather! You should have heard from your Ancestress that the trip to Kanas this time was like a hairbreadth escape, and it’s been with great difficulty that I could come back to recuperate from my injuries. Can you just let me have a good rest?”</p><p>“This… alright!”</p><p>Xue Yu scrunched up for a moment and then turned around, directly opened the door of the opposite room and went in.</p><p>Bam…</p><p>After the door was closed, Tang Xiu walked to the bed with a helpless expression and straightly laid himself down while cursing inside, What a dogskin plaster living ancestor!</p><p>“Now that I think about it, the Heavenly Law of this place is kind of affecting me. Is it because I was hurt by love when I was in the Immortal World and now I’m getting compensated after returning to Earth? Else this kind of peach blossoms tribulation is not supposed to be like this!”</p><p>Tang Xiu revived the scenes when he was in the Immortal World. He never found any other woman who liked him in the ten thousand years there other than Xue Qingcheng. Logically speaking, he was a prominent hegemon with a terrifying cultivation. Wasn’t it said that beauties loved heroic men? But why he did not have them at that time?</p><p>He was not sure as he had never thought of this aspect when he was in the Immortal World, especially after he had Xue Qingcheng, as he fully devoted his heart to her and no other women could enter his eyes. How would he know how many billion women admired him when he was there?</p><p>But after returning to Earth, he had to consider about romance solely due to his Mother and also had to find himself a wife to bear his children. Else he was afraid that his mother would get angry and also feared that his refusal would make her distressed.</p><p>Tang Xiu exempted himself from cultivating that night. Although he had fully healed from his injuries, tossing around for nights and days still made him weary and struck with fatigue. He then took a shower and changed his clothes. Just as he was about to go to bed, a knocking sound was heard from his door, as Xue Yu’s pleasant voice was transmitted from the outside.</p><p>“Tang Xiu, I need to wash and change clothes.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
