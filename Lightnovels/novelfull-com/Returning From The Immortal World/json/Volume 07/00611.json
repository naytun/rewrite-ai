They had done all they could today for the welfare house. Though the trio couldn’t guess how many people would pay attention and what changes would occur to the welfare house.</p><p>Tang Xiu himself had transferred 2 million yuan into the Bluestar Welfare House’s public account, and so did Tian Xiaomeng with her pledge of 100 thousand yuan.</p><p>“Alright, ladies. Now I’ll treat you to a meal.” Tang Xiu didn’t let Long Xueyao drive this time, as he drove the car himself and took the two women to hit the road.</p><p>“Tang Xiu, the lunch must be on me today.” Long Xueyao shook her head. “I’d rather not have lunch today if you refuse.”</p><p>“Eh? Why?” Tang Xiu was puzzled.</p><p>“I originally asked you to come help me move some things, but I never thought that things would evolve into this kind of situation, to be honest.” Long Xueyao seriously said. “Anyhow, I’m very happy, excited, and grateful for that. I alone can’t support the entire welfare house despite having a high salary, and you’ve done a lot today. So, I want to do what I can to express my gratitude, even if the opportunity is just merely treating you to a meal.”</p><p>Tang Xiu was taken aback and fell into silence for a moment, before nodding and saying, “Since it will be your treat, then let us head to an upscale restaurant today, and I’ll take the honors to pick the place. Do you object to it?”</p><p>Long Xueyao let out a smile in response and gently shook her head.</p><p>Tian Xiaomeng who sat on the back seat had unknowingly activated her live broadcast channel, and thus the conversation between Tang Xiu and Long Xueyao was aired by her.</p><p>In the live channel, the viewers that had originally left began to come back again, and many were curious as to how high-class the restaurant Tang Xiu chose would be. Certainly, there were also some who raised a ruckus, commenting that Tang Xiu’s philanthropic deeds before was nothing but a show. After all, he had just finished the live broadcast at that welfare house, and now he was going to such an extravagant place to have a meal. It was a stark contrast and hardly justifiable.</p><p>Koufu Spicy Numbing Stir-Fry Pot.</p><p>After Tang Xiu parked the car outside, he let out a smile and said, “I heard the Spicy Numbing Stir-Fry Pot is very popular among girls. You two have no problems with hot and spicy things, right?”</p><p>Long Xueyao herself didn’t care what kind of meal she would have, so she let out a smile, showing that she didn’t have a problem with it. After Tian Xiaomeng came down from the car, she aimed her mobile at the signboard of Koufu Spicy Numbing Stir-Fry Pot, and then pouted her small mouth while her fingers typed the words: This is the legendary top grade, high-class, upscale…</p><p>In an instant, hundreds of thousands of subscribers and viewers watching the live broadcast channel burst into laughter, along with an incoming burst of smiling and amused emojis from everywhere. Some of the viewers with bad tastes were quick to comment: Luckily, it’s not the hot spicy soup often sold in street stalls she’s gonna eat, else we would surely see the goddess turning into a boiled duck, getting wrapped and flying to someone’s house...</p><p>Tian Xiaomeng saw Long Xueyao waving at her. After calling out, she watched her and Tang Xiu walking into the store and then spoke in a low voice, “I’m telling you a secret. Divine Doctor Tang is actually a rich bigwig, and he certainly doesn’t want to make Sis Long Xueyao spend her money. I haven’t told you all before, but he has donated 2 million yuan to the Bluestar Welfare House today. Alright, I just spilled the secret now, so I feel quite good. Anyways, Mengmeng is starving, so I have to calm my belly first.”</p><p>And thus ended the live broadcast.</p><p>Tian Xiaomeng put away her mobile phone and quickly caught up, whereas the hundreds of thousands of fans in the live broadcast channel were shocked by her words.</p><p>2 million yuan?</p><p>Though they had time to spare to watch the live broadcast, most of them could be said to have good living conditions, but 2 million yuan still was a very large amount of money to them. And Divine Doctor Tang…. was actually donating such an amount?</p><p>An instant after, praises inundated the live broadcast channel, all of which aimed at Tang Xiu.</p><p>As the lunch was over, Tang Xiu didn’t leave with Long Xueyao as the latter drove Tian Xiaomeng back home. While having some time to spare this afternoon, Tang Xiu decided to visit his family’s restaurant. It was not yet the time to eat, so there weren’t many patrons for now. Tang Xiu wandered around inside and then learned that his mother didn’t come today. After making a phone call, he then learned that his parents had to catch the train for Beijing early this morning.</p><p>Tang Xiu asked them why they went to Beijing all of a sudden. The result was that his mother, Su Lingyun, unexpectedly chirped and whined for half of the day without telling him the reason.</p><p>“Ah, forget it, then. I’m going to see Long Zhengyu.”</p><p>He left the restaurant and called Long Zhengyu, thus learning that the guy was on his way to Long’s Dining Hall. Tang Xiu then headed straight to the venue to catch up with him.</p><p>This time, the security guards at Long’s Dining Hall didn’t stop him since they already recognized him, with some of them with looks of dread on their faces when they looked at Tang Xiu.</p><p>Melodious piano music invaded his ear when he entered the great hall. Tang Xiu shot a quick glance toward the direction of the piano music as he walked towards the elevator. His pace instantly came to halt and he turned stunned. It was because the girl he saw playing the piano turned out to be Andy.</p><p>“How come she’s here?”</p><p>After thinking for a short while, Tang Xiu changed his direction and walked toward Andy. He didn’t disturb her play, however, but leaned on the corner wall and quietly watched her playing the piano. After five-plus minutes passed by and the music faded away, Tang Xiu applauded and smilingly said, “What a great play.”</p><p>Andy turned around and suddenly stood up from the chair upon seeing Tang Xiu and run toward him. With a cheerful expression, she greeted him and said, “Why are here, Boss?”</p><p>“That’s also the same question I want to ask you,” said Tang Xiu with a smile. “Why did you come here and even played the piano?”</p><p>“The folks in our company’s Finance Department are going to dine here tonight, so I came earlier to reserve a box.” Andy giggled. “But then I saw the piano here and kinda wanted to play something. Anyways, are you here to book a room too, Boss? Do you want me to reserve it for you?”</p><p>“Nah, I’m going to see a friend of mine,” replied Tang Xiu with a smile.</p><p>Still with her cheerful smile, Andy asked, “Are you here to dine tonight, too, Boss? Can you attend the dinner with the folks from our company’s Finance Department?”</p><p>“Let’s wait until the evening, shall we?” Replied Tang Xiu after thinking for a short moment. “If I still have time to spare tonight, then I’ll come. But if something comes up, then forget it.”</p><p>“I’ll be very happy if you can come over, Boss.” Andy nodded and smilingly said. “Anyhow, you’re on fire again this year boss, nearly the entire internet is on fire by the reportage about you.”</p><p>Becoming hot news again?</p><p>Tang Xiu was stumped for words as he looked at Andy and asked with a puzzled expression, “How could it be? What caused it, exactly?”</p><p>“It was because of what you did in Bluestar Welfare House!” Answered Andy with a smile. “It was said in the entire Internet that you are a real philanthropist, an old-school person with a benevolent heart. That Goddess Mengmeng especially told everyone that you donated 2 million yuan to the Bluestar Welfare House, causing everyone to praise you.”</p><p>Cough! Cough…</p><p>Tang Xiu coughed a few times and a helpless expression appeared on his handsome face. He didn’t even consider such an aftermath back then, as he just wanted to make the Bluestar Welfare House receive its due and proper attention from the public so that they could help those children have a better life in the future. Who could have ever thought that Tian Xiaomeng would disclose the matter that he had donated money?</p><p>There was nothing he was afraid nowadays. But being famous was one!</p><p>Earth and the Immortal World is like day and night. Having a big sounding name in the Immortal World would make others awe and dread and hardly anybody would dare to provoke you. But Earth is a stark contrast. Once you have fame here, you will be like those celebrities and big stars, where even paparazzi will be after you to secretly take photos of whatever you did, not to mention that innumerable fans will surround you. Even some people with deep background and status would still look at you with whatever their particular expressions. And this aftermath was completely different from his original intention.</p><p>To have a tranquil and peaceful life was what he really wanted while devoting himself to accumulate wealth and obtain massive resources for cultivation, to assist him in walking further and faster on his cultivation path, and in passing, accompanying his parents at the same time, getting along with his family members and enjoy the warmth provided by his family.</p><p>What’s done is done. I have been low-key recently, and no tempest can withstand the time either. Maybe after school starts next year, there will only be a few who will still remember this matter. Tang Xiu consoled himself inwardly.</p><p>Knowing that Tang Xiu had an appointment with his friend, Andy didn’t pester him anymore. Still, excited after seeing Tang Xiu, she went to the person in charge of the hotel to reserve a box and chatted with the woman in charge.</p><p>Inside the presidential suite.</p><p>After pushing the door open, Tang Xiu saw Long Zhengyu holding a girl and conversing with her. Though there was incense burning inside the room, yet the smoke still shrouded it.</p><p>Long Zhengyu patted the girl’s shoulder and said, “Pretty little girl, we only happened to meet this time. Go now! I will see you tonight if nothing comes up.”</p><p>“Okay!” The girl quickly glanced at Tang Xiu as an alluring blush appeared on her small, beautiful face. She lowered her head as passed by Tang Xiu and quickly left the room.</p><p>Tang Xiu shook his head and forced out a smile, “How come I didn’t find out before that you are a Casanova, eh? I didn’t hear anything about you dating a serious girlfriend. Is she the one?”</p><p>Rolling his eyes in response, Long Zhengyu listlessly nested himself on the sofa and said, “Man, are you really my friend? You really love to touch someone’s sore spot, don’t you? I just broke up with her. That woman has quite a great heart, yet her ambition is greater. She wants to be independent, relying on herself to fight for her career and life with her own two hands, thus she wants to go abroad.”</p><p>Tang Xiu walked to his side and took a sit. Then, he said with a strange expression, “For that so-called fighting for herself she broke up with you?”</p><p>Snap…</p><p>Long Zhengyu grabbed a lighter and cigarette, lit it and took a deep, and then said with a helpless expression, “Can we change the subject? I will vomit blood otherwise.”</p><p>Astounded, Tang Xiu said, “I do want to change the topic, you know. But your last sentence really evoked my curiosity. Care to talk more about it? We are all buddies, man. Why the need to cover it and bottle it up inside since you have broken up with her?”</p><p>“You are to treat me tonight, then!” Long Zhengyu took a deep puff and replied while blowing out smoke.</p><p>“No problem. Put it into my account,” said Tang Xiu without thinking.</p><p>“As a matter of fact, this is my first time getting dumped by a woman,” narrated Long Zhengyu with a bitter smile. “And she’s the first woman who did that in my entire life. Do you wanna know the reason she used to break up with me? She said that ‘distant water cannot quench present thirst’. What the fuck? This father is not that ‘thirsty’ at all, but she actually…” [1]</p><p>Chapter Notes:</p><p>1.   Distant water cannot quench present thirst… I was kinda under the impression that it’s a long distance relationship, so things like sex and the likes will be in the way. I’ll change it after asking the author about what he meant later.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
