It was just that he couldn’t think it through. Why Mu Wanying wanted to help him pay his debt. Could it be that his business went bankrupt?</p><p>“What exactly happened?” Asked Tang Xiu curiously.</p><p>“People say that scandals in the family should not be made public. But you’ll be my closest person in the future and I don’t want to hide it from you.” Mu Wanying bitterly smiled. “My Dad is kind of set in his own ways, a headstrongness that is unsuitable to run a business, I may say. He only managed a few businesses in the family, but those two small companies appeared to be in the red every year and he always asked a sum of money from me every year for the sake of his face. If anything, this is not the main concern since the most important thing is that… he has another woman other than my Mom, and children too, even though those half-brothers and sisters of mine are not recognized by the Mu House.”</p><p>Tang Xiu instantly understood. It was said that even an upright official finds it hard to settle family troubles. Yet, he did not want to express his own opinion since Mu Wanying’s mother, Jiang Zhenli, seemed able to bear it. After hesitating for a while, he patted her back and said, “Anyways, you can directly speak to me if you don’t have enough money later. Besides, you’re the woman I’m going to marry in the future, so I can’t leave you by yourself.”</p><p>A smile broke out in Mu Wanying’s face as she said, “Having your promise is already enough for me. But I still think that women still have to be self-reliant and independent. Also, the business I’m doing now is running well with quite remarkable annual profits, enough for my own spending.”</p><p>“Whether it’s enough or not, you still have to look for me first in case that you’re in need of money,” said Tang Xiu. “There are tons of things I need to manage recently and a lot of them require money, but I can still easily take out tens of billions of yuan.”</p><p>Mu Wanying faintly smiled and suddenly said, “Back when we first met in Tianjin City, didn’t you say that you’re very poor? I remember that you made money by selling calligraphy and paintings at that time.”</p><p>“Hahaha, I was really poor at that time, to be honest.” Tang Xiu laughed. “The Magnificent Tang Corporation had yet to make a profit and needed quite a lot of money to invest instead. Besides, I originally needed to buy some cultivation resources and that also required quite a sum of money. No, that’s not right. You couldn’t be wanting to settle an account with me, right? I recall making a lot of money from you back then.”</p><p>“Pfft… Hahaha.” Mu Wanying covered her laugh. “Never did I dare to have the idea to settle an account with you. You are now a super rich man, so I will need you to support me in the future.”</p><p>Grace Regale Advertising.</p><p>Located in a bustling area of Hong District, the company occupied an entire floor of a dozen storied high-rise office building. The company only had a small number of employees, around 40, but the interior decoration was extremely extravagant and had its own unique style. It was Tang Xiu’s first time visiting the venue and it gave him a bright feel.</p><p>“You came, Boss. Anyways, Director Wei from Blessed Fortune Jewelry knew that you were coming today, so he brought his friend surnamed Zhang he mentioned before.” A slim female secretary wearing glasses and dressed like a college student reported respectfully after shooting a curious glance at Tang Xiu.</p><p>At the moment, Mu Wanying revealed her strong and capable side. She took the document handed over by the female secretary and asked, “Which reception room are they in?”</p><p>\"No. 2,\" replied the female secretary.</p><p>“Alright.” Mu Wanying nodded. “Call Manager Miao and tell him to go there first. Tell him I’ll be there shortly.”</p><p>Following that, Mu Wanying headed to her office with Tang Xiu. The office was nearly 100 square meters, and its interior design was very fashionable and luxurious. Behind the half-moon shaped desk were a row of wall-mounted bookcases filled with books and documents, while at the other end were two big and three small sofas with a tea table in the middle.</p><p>The most notable thing there was that there were a lot of potted bonsais giving off a vibrant feeling even though it was an office.</p><p>“Your office is quite great,” said Tang Xiu in praise.</p><p>Mu Wanying let out a smile and personally served Tang Xiu a cup of tea, and then said, “I’m going to see the clients first and then we’ll then go to the 18th floor! The client there… is the type that I hate.”</p><p>Tang Xiu instantly realized that that the kind of annoyance Mu Wanying mentioned should be a pursuer of hers. At this moment, he finally understood why she wanted him to accompany her to her company today. It was obvious that she wanted to announce to the others that the precious flower already had an owner.</p><p>Inside the reception room #2.</p><p>Right as Mu Wanying came inside, her brows slightly furrowed since she found that other than her longtime client Director Wei, there was also the other client, Zhang Danyang from the 18th floor’s Shunde Door Industry. As of now, 40% of the advertisement jobs in her Grace Regale Advertising came from the Shunde Door Industry, and even though it was not comparable to the advertising quota from Director Wei’s company, it was not a small client either.</p><p>“How have you been well Director Wei, Chief Zhang?”</p><p>The frowning expression on Mu Wanying’s face only lasted for a moment as she let out a smile and greeted them.</p><p>Wei Zongchao got up and said with a smile, “Chief Mu, it never occurred to me that this old friend of mine from Shunde Door Industry is actually having a cooperation with your company too. I was kind of wanting to introduce him to you, but I did not expect you have actually captured his heart a long time ago. Hahaha...”</p><p>Mu Wanying’s breath lagged and she just glanced at the smiling Zhang Danyang, who also got up and said with a smile, “Ah, you’re joking with me, Director Wei. Chief Zhang’s Shunde Door Industry and my company happen to occupy the same office building, so it’s rather convenient for us to cooperate. Anyways, Director Wei, I heard that you declined the advertising prospectus I made for your company a couple of days ago, may I ask for the specific reasons?”</p><p>“I felt optimistic for the plan which Miss Mu personally tailored for my company since it was not done by the people of your company’s design department. I did not think that the plan was without merit, though. Only, I always felt like it missed something. By the way, I just realized it after Chief Zhang mentioning it to me.”</p><p>Chief Zhang?</p><p>The smile on Mu Wanying’s face instantly disappeared without a trace, and with her smart head, she immediately realized the reason why Wei Zongchao was making things difficult to her company must be related to Zhang Danyang.</p><p>As she had guessed, Zhang Danyang smiled and said, “Wanying, we are all old acquaintances. It’s easy to carry out an advertising plan as long as it is done well. However, Director Wei owes me a big favor. So, when he learned that I have a business cooperation and also am in love with you, he just wanted to help me. We also have reached an agreement here that, as long as you and I become a family, we’ll hand over all the ads of his company and mine to you.”</p><p>Mu Wanying’s face turned a bit unsightly, for she could sense the threat in Zhang Danyang’s statement. After a moment of silence, she said slowly, “Chief Zhang, we’re doing business, I hope you don’t bring your personal feelings into it. Also, I already told you that I have a boyfriend already, so it’s impossible for us to have this kind of relationship.”</p><p>“No, Wanying. I still have the right to pursue you as long as you’re not married yet.” Zhang Danyang shook his head. “Besides, I’m sure you are also aware of the state of the situation of the society in our country. We’re a society governed by favors and human relations. Doing business here is inseparable from the human relations context.”</p><p>“Chief Zhang, you…” Mu Wanying was angered.</p><p>“I love you from the bottom of my heart, Wanying.” Zhang Danyang raised his hand to interrupt her and smilingly said, “I even divorced that tigress in my home and I also gave her our children. I’m really sincere about this and I believe you can also feel it. Also, we have ties in our businesses, so it could be said that we have a double relationship. You can rest assured that I’ll definitely use all of my resources and personal network to aid you in drawing a lot of clients as long as you become my woman.”</p><p>“Your divorce has nothing to do with me whatsoever, and I won’t accept you either,” said Mu Wanying without hesitation. “Furthermore, this is my own company and I can draw the clients by myself.”</p><p>The smile on Zhang Danyang’s face gradually disappeared and his tone became aggressive, “Will you still reject me if I and Brother Wei are to terminate our cooperation? That’s right, I also have a very close relationship with the other clients of your company, Chief Zhao of the Zhongteng Tiles and Chief Hao of the Jianye Wardrobe.”</p><p>Mu Wanying’s face was as though covered with frost as she angrily said, “Did you investigate my company?”</p><p>Zhang Yan let out a complacent smile and said, “No no no. I did not specifically investigate your company. It’s just that I had a tea gathering with Brother Wei, Chief Wang, and Chief Hao, so we had a chat and inadvertently learned about it.”</p><p>Disgust and loathing birthed inside Mu Wanying’s heart. Little did she expect that the usually well-mannered and mature Zhang Danyang turned out to be this low and despicable. Her eyes then fell on Wei Zongchao and asked, “Director Wei, we have been cooperating in several projects before and I believe you’ve seen my Grace Regal Advertising’s capital and reliability. We will soon sign the new cooperation agreement for the new cooperation project as well. Are you really going to leave in a bad term in the final moment and give up the interests of your company for an outsider?”</p><p>Wei Zongchao smacked his lips and smilingly said, “Why shouldn’t I do it if I will get more benefits later just from giving up this small profit at present?”</p><p>“You…” Right now, Mu Wanying was really fuming.</p><p>Clap clap clap…</p><p>The door was pushed open from the outside and applause sounded in. Tang Xiu scrutinized the shameless faces of Wei Zongchao and Zhang Danyang and sneered inwardly. He originally planned to wait for Mu Wanying in her office. But as he recalled how she was quiet and refined usually, he wanted to come and see how she acted when dealing with official business affairs. Who could have thought that he would hear such a brilliant and splendid threat and intimidation?</p><p>“Tang Xiu…”</p><p>The fuming anger in Mu Wanying’s heart weakened somewhat upon seeing Tang Xiu.</p><p>Tang Xiu did not pay attention to Mu Wanying but walked towards Wei Zongchao and Zhang Danyang as he then took a seat on the sofa. He then tilted up one of his legs, took a cigarette and lit it up, and then smilingly spoke after drawing several puffs, “Both of you are supposed to be grown-ups, don’t you think that bullying my fiancée is kind of a bit too much? Also, the first sentence I just heard, you can still pursue her as long as she’s not married yet? Well, well. Don’t you just want to dig around the corner of what is mine openly?”</p><p>“Who are you?” Asked Zhang Danyang coldly with a vigilant look.</p><p>“Who I am is not something nobodies like you guys can fathom,” said Tang Xiu with a smile. “If the both of you don’t want to do business with my family’s Wanying, then take your shot. To be honest with you, for my Wanying to have clients such as you guys, I’m starting to worry about her.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
