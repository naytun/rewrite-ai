Despite he himself seeing the act of having sex as something perfectly justified and natural, yet he was also particularly cautious in this aspect. It was not because he did not want to love or be loved, as it was more due to the scar and pain inside his heart that had not yet healed. He was conscious of the fact that there were many outstanding girls around him whom he too had many favorable impressions towards, but before that badly battered scar inside him was not yet healed, he did not wish to have the same mistake be repeated, for he could not bear to experience another betrayal ever again.</p><p>It was fine whether or not he made a mistake or overreached himself by becoming fake lovers with Mu Wanying due to a strange combination of circumstances. Perhaps the matter with Mu Wanying would be known to his family, but he was sure that the problem would be solved as long as he explained it well.</p><p>He also didn’t feel like explaining himself to the others and casually threw a few perfunctory remarks before dragging Bai Tao away from the bowling alley.</p><p>“Brother Tang, having such an outstanding belle such as Mu Wanying should make you very happy, right? But why do I see you with a long face?” Whispered Bai Tao as he noticed Tang Xiu’s unusualness.</p><p>“There’s nothing to be unhappy about, really.” Tang Xiu shook his head. “I just didn’t expect that Sis Ying would bring Mu Wanying to see my grandmother. Let’s forget it, shall we? Anyways, you seem to be interested in that female swimming coach. I can see your eyes shining when Qin Shaoyang mentioned her.”</p><p>Bai Tao looked blank before he snapped back to his senses, as an awkward expression appeared on his face. He then forced a wry smile and said, “There’s probably only a handful of people in Beijing who know that I have a crush on Guo Tiantian. A pity that it’s nothing but an unrequited love, a one-side lovesickness, for Guo Tiantian’s eyes are on top of her head; she can’t see me at all.”</p><p>“Have you tried pursuing her?” Asked Tang Xiu with a smile.</p><p>“I’ve done more than pursuing her..” Bai Tao nodded. “I’ve done all I could have done, yet the belle didn’t even give me a smile.”</p><p>“It was not enough?” Asked Tang Xiu, astounded. “You are such a good catch! Could it be that she already has someone she likes?”</p><p>“No, she doesn’t. Absolutely not,” replied Bai Tao with a serious face. “I investigated nearly everything regarding her family background and social circles. She doesn’t have any contact with other men at all. Apart from a few of her besties, she usually stays with that big mastiff inside, and those two don’t take even a step out of the door.”</p><p>“Eh, she couldn’t like women, could she?” Asked Tang Xiu with a strange expression.</p><p>“That’s impossible!” Bai Tao rolled his eyes at him and snappily retorted. “I already asked her few best friends. I can confirm that her sexual orientation is normal.”</p><p>“I see. Then don’t be pessimistic since you already figured it out.” Tang Xiu smiled. “If you can’t catch her in the first time, then try a second time. Fail in the second try, then try another  ten times. If a year is not enough, then give it two years; and if it’s still not enough, then continue for ten years. Shortly put, provided that you put in a great deal of effort, you can grind an iron rod into a needle, hence achieving everything you want.”</p><p>With eyes lit up, Bai Tao nodded and replied, “Your ability to pick up hot chicks is absolutely unsurpassable, Brother Tang. You’re so powerful that you make them collapse. I believe you…”</p><p>Powerful your sister! Tang Xiu cursed inside.</p><p>“I wanna know something, though. Since you have made Mu Wanying your girlfriend, what will you do with Ouyang Lulu?” Bai Tao asked curiously all of a sudden. “She’s in love with you like hovering between life and death, that’s for sure. She even pumped out all her properties and left Jingmen Island for Shanghai just to be closer to you. You… you couldn’t be thinking to discard her after having made use of her, could you?”</p><p>“Bai Tao, can we talk about other things besides women?” Tang Xiu said grudgingly. “Don’t you want to see that sweetheart in your dreams?  If you don’t want to, do you want me back to the bowling alley to play with the others?”</p><p>“No no no. I don’t want it, it won’t do!” Bai Tao grinned and dragged Tang Xiu.</p><p>As the duo came to the swimming pool, they only saw three girls swimming there. Tang Xiu stopped his at the entrance and looked at Bai Tao’s excited face and quickly walked inside.</p><p>Splash…</p><p>As the water splashed in all directions, a girl with a well-developed, streamlined figure and ordinary looks, yet looking remarkable, was holding the handrails at the poolside.</p><p>Tang Xiu looked as Bai Tao moved closer to her, and then quietly turned around and left with a smile on his face. He didn’t leave directly and went to the Leisure Hall instead, since he still needed to discuss with Qin Shaoyang about their cooperation. He told the attendant to make a pot of tea for him before sitting alone in the rest area, savoring his tea and reading the fashion magazine he took from the shelf before.</p><p>****</p><p>At the Tang Family’s ancestral residence.</p><p>It was Mu Wanying’s first time visiting here and her expression was a bit disturbed. When Tang Ying came to the entrance, her pace became slower and slower before she finally stopped walking.</p><p>“What’s going on with you, Wanying?” Tang Ying noticed the abnormality, as she turned around and asked her.</p><p>“Sis Ying, let’s forget it! Tang Xiu and I are…” Said Mu Wanying in an undertone voice.</p><p>Tang Ying grabbed her wrist and pulled inside while smilingly saying, “Don’t worry, Wanying. Even an ugly daughter-in-law must see their parents-in-law sooner or later. And you’re not even ugly at all, as you are hailed as the First Beauty of the capital instead. I’m sure that my grandmother will like you very much. Relax! My Uncle and Auntie are in Star City, and you will see them with Tang Xiu there.”</p><p>What Mu Wanying wanted to tell Tang Ying was that her relationship with Tang Xiu was not like what everyone thought of. Yet the words were so hard to come out of her mouth though they were at the tip of her tongue already. She then braced herself as she entered the Tang Family’s residence and directly bumped into Tang Min coming out.</p><p>“Auntie!” Tang Ying called out with a smiling face.</p><p>Tang Min gently nodded at her in response, after which her eyes fell on Mu Wanying and smilingly said, “Isn’t this the Little Princes of the Mu House? You really match the rumors as the First Beauty of the capital!”</p><p>Mu Wanying’s gorgeous face blushed and hurriedly lowered her head.</p><p>Tang Ying let out a sweet smile and said, “Auntie, you should have no objection if the First Beauty of the capital becomes your nephew’s wife, right? But I’m afraid you can’t stop them even if you object, though.”</p><p>Nephew’s wife to be?</p><p>Tang Min’s blinked and she looked at Mu Wanying again before finally nodding and saying with satisfaction, “Little Ning is really great. He actually can…”</p><p>“You’re mistaken, Auntie,” interrupted Tang Ying quickly. “She’s not my brother’s girlfriend, but Tang Xiu’s. Grandma has been nagging all day, hoping that Xiu will bring his wife and give her grandchildren, right? Today, I’ve spent a lot of effort to bring Wanying over.”</p><p>Staring blankly and stunned, a surprised look immediately plastered itself on Tang Min’s face, and even the way she looked at Mu Wanying was different at this time, a kind of look that was… particularly warm.</p><p>“Wanying, right? I never thought that that precious nephew of mine was so skillful to actually be able to find such a beautiful girl like you. Anyways, let’s go inside. I was originally planning to go out to tend to something, but I must put it down even if the matter is big since you are already here. Come, I’ll bring you inside. I’m sure Mom will be happy!”</p><p>Hearing this made Mu Wanying’s heart shake. She subconsciously turned her head back. After she was sure that Tang Xiu didn’t catch up with them, some expectations as well as anxiousness crept inside her immediately. She indeed had a very close relationship with Tang Xiu as of recently, and it was entirely due to her initiative. Yet, she still couldn’t figure out what Tang Xiu really had in mind. In the case that Tang Xiu got angry because of this, then…</p><p>In the backyard.</p><p>Qin Changyue was holding a broom and cleaning the yard. Since her body turned healthier and stronger all of a sudden, it was like she was several years younger, and she felt very relaxed as she cleaned the yard with an especially happy mood.</p><p>“Mother, look who Little Ying brought home,” smilingly said Tang Min after she pulled Mu Wanying’s slender little hand and entered the backyard.</p><p>Qin Changyue stood up a bit before observing Mu Wanying carefully and hesitatingly saying, “This young lady is…”</p><p>“How do you do, Grandma,” hurriedly called out Mu Wanying.</p><p>“Mother, her name is Mu Wanying—the little princess of the Mu House,” said Tang Min with a smile. “The most important thing is that she’s your grandson—Tang Xiu’s girlfriend.”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>Qin Changyue’s face was blank before a pleasantly surprised expression replaced it. She hastily put down the broom and walked toward Mu Wanying. She sized her up from head to toe before a thick smile climbed up her face, as she then nodded a few times and said, “Good, good. It’s just great! Very elegant and beautiful, and a good temperament as well. My treasured grandson… he really does his best to succeed and was finally able to find himself a very outstanding girlfriend. Ying… Wanying, right? Let’s go inside the house with Grandma…”</p><p>Mu Wanying could sense Qin Changyue’s joy came from her heart after Tang Min mentioning her as Tang Xiu’s girlfriend, thus she was a little uneasy and relieved at the same time.</p><p>With a smile, Tang Ying said, “Grandma, I brought you your granddaughter-in-law but delayed the work Dad assigned me. You have to protect me if he blames me later!”</p><p>Filled with joy, Qin Changyue replied, “I’ll pack your father if he dares to be angry with you, Little Ying! You did great, Grandma is really happy.”</p><p>Tang Ying’s last worry finally vanished as she happily said, “It’s great if you feel satisfied, Grandma. Besides, I spent quite the effort to bring Wanying here! Tang Xiu was originally going to come back with us, but he has important things to discuss with a few of his friends, so he asked me to bring her back first.”</p><p>With an excited look on her face, Qin Changyue nodded and threw a few praises to Tang Xiu. Then, she took Mu Wanying’s hand and walked her to the house. The kindness she displayed somewhat made Mu Wanying couldn’t endure it.</p><p>Looking at her mother’s happy look, Tang Min was also greatly affected. People say that it was enough to make things lively when three women got together. The three generations of women of the Tang Family and Mu Wanying got along together and each put out their greatest enthusiasm, but Mu Wanying felt a bit guilty inside.</p><p>After worrying inside for a long time, Mu Wanying finally acted as Tang Min and Tang Ying went out. She didn’t answered Qin Changyue’s question about her family and instead spoke with a bit of an apologetic expression, “Grandma, this is actually a misunderstanding from Sis Ying. Tang Xiu and I are not really not lovers.”</p><p>“What?” The smile on Qin Changyue’s face froze and her expression was bit dazed.</p><p>“Actually, Tang Xiu and I are not real lovers,” continued Mu Wanying quickly. “We pretended to be lovers in front outsiders since Tang Xiu is trying to help me block the other male students from harassing me. Grandma, I’m really sorry about this. It was originally out of my intention, but it was Sis Ying who misunderstood it, whereas Auntie Tang was also too enthusiastic. I’m…”</p><p>Qin Changyue slowly come back to her senses. After scrunching up for a short while, she then squinted her eyes and asked, “Now, tell me, do you like our family’s Xiu’er?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
