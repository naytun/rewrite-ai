Though she hadn’t yet entered society, how could she not see that Director Bai’s group of three wanted to take advantage of her? And yet, shouldn’t he protect her as a her mentor?</p><p>All of a sudden, deep regret filled her heart. She regretted agreeing to Tang Zhen to come to the appointment today.</p><p>Li Xiaoqian took a deep breath to suppress the dizzy feeling inside before speaking, “Teacher, I really can’t drink anymore, else I won’t be able to go back today. Please have your drink while I go to the bathroom first.”</p><p>Seeing that Li Xiaoqian unexpectedly dared to disobey him at this time, Tang Zhen was angered. He felt that he couldn’t keep his little face and grabbed her arm as he angrily shouted, “SIT! DOWN!”</p><p>“Bam…”</p><p>Tang Zhen’s powerful pull made Li Xiaoqian, who was currently slightly drunk, stumble and fall to the floor as she even touched the glass in front of her smashed to the side.</p><p>Director Bai’s eyes lit up. He hurriedly got up and turned around to hug her from behind. When his hands pretended to hold up her up, he grabbed her proud peaks, but the effort he exerted on his hands was not a drunkard’s, but for other purposes. It was nothing short of an indecent act.</p><p>“LET GO OF ME!”</p><p>Li Xiaoqian finally realized that Director Bai was nothing but a wolf in a human skin—a bastard with a good occupation. She pushed his hands with and struggled to stand up. Just as she got up and pushed his hands away, she slapped his face and cursed, “You have no sense of shame, pervert!”</p><p>Director Bai was furious, as he grabbed Li Xiaoqian’s head and punched her face and yelled, “You fucking bitch! You dare to slap me?”</p><p>The punch caused blood to flow from the corner of Li Xiaoqian’s mouth.</p><p>At this time, Tang Zhen also lost his temper but could only endure it since he was, after all, her mentor. He squeezed out a smile to persuade him, “Director Bai, please don’t stoop down to the level of this ignorant girl. She just drank too much and didn’t intentionally offend you. You can rest assured that I’ll make her accompany you drinking for a few glasses today.”</p><p>Ptui…</p><p>Amidst Li Xiaoqian’s struggles and Tang Zhen’s persuasion, Director Bai released his hand and spat to the floor, “However much you drunk, don’t you dare play with this Father! What kind of bitches have I not seen? You came to this wine table and yet you still want to pretend to be a chaste one?”</p><p>Li Xiaoqian burst into tears. She repressed the humiliation inside, quickly grabbed her bag and run toward the door. She opened the door and dashed out before they were able to react.</p><p>“Don’t say that I didn’t warn you, bitch!” Director Bai shouted angrily. “Not only will you not enter the show in the future, you will never even get in the preliminaries! You’re a trifling thing to this Father, FUCKING BITCH!”</p><p>Flames of anger were burning inside Tang Zhen’s heart; this was the first time he took his student out to entertain others and ended up in a mess. He hastily spoke some words to console Director Bai before hastily chasing outside. He knew the power Director Bai possessed in the Blue City TV station and knew the status and personal connections of this honored guest in the music circle. Li Xiaoqian’s future was going to fall into the abyss of darkness if she was allowed to run away like this today.</p><p>When he rushed out of the door he saw Li Xiaoqian about a dozen meters away in the corridor on the floor due to drinking too much. After rushing over, he grabbed her arm and furiously spoke, “Have you done messing this up already? Do you think you still have a chance to enter the music world after you’ve offended those three? Go back with me to apologize to them!”</p><p>“I won’t apologize to them. They’re all perverts. Nothing good on them whatsoever!” Li Xiaoqian shouted. “You’re my mentor, how could you push me into the fire pit?”</p><p>“Who the fuck pushed you into the fire pit?” Tang Zhen angrily retorted. “I’m here for your sake—to introduce you to them, or else why the hell did I bring you out to entertain them? Why on earth did you push those who fill to the full for?”</p><p>“I’d rather not learn music in the future than letting those damn bastards bully me. LET ME GO!” Yelled Li Xiaoqian.</p><p>Pa…</p><p>With a face of filled with regret, like having his offspring not living up to his expectations, Tang Zhen slapped Li Xiaoqian, making her stumble. Then he pointed at her and furiously cursed, “I thought you were more promising, Li Xiaoqian! Never did I think that you’re nothing but a worthless shit! Where will my face go if you walk away today, huh? Come back inside with me to apologize to them! Even if you don’t want to enter the show in the future, you still must come down to finish this scene!”</p><p>Crawling up from the floor yet again, Li Xiaoqian stared at Tang Zhen with disbelief. She suddenly came to the realization that her usually refined, neat-dressed mentor, the associate professor of the Regal Classical Music Academy turned out to be not a nice person at all. There was nothing about him that showcased the morality and integrity a teacher must have.</p><p>She must run! She could never let herself be ruined in the hands of those dregs!</p><p>Li Xiaoqian resisted the fainting sensation that flooded her brain. She didn’t even have time to pick up her bag on the floor and turned to run toward the stairs. She ran so quickly that dozens of meters were passed by. Just as she was preparing to rush down the stairs upon seeing that Tang Zhen was chasing her, two waiters appeared at the stairs with plates blocking most of the corridor path.</p><p>Under desperation, she didn’t want to change her direction and kept running toward the stairs. She could feel that the distance between her and Tang Zhen was getting closer, as she was still a girl and even had drunk a lot of wine. Yet she still gave her best to run away—although fear filled her heart.</p><p>Bam…</p><p>In the corridor of the second floor, Li XIaoqian ran into a soft embrace. In her panicked state, she finally shouted, “HELP! PERVERT!”</p><p>Ouyang Lulu, who had just come out of the restroom, was at a loss whether she had to laugh or cry after being hit by a drunken woman. The woman ran into her embrace and unexpectedly yelled that there was a “pervert”. She was a girl with normal sex orientation, for god’s sake. How could she molest the same sex, to begin with?</p><p>Just a moment after, she was surprised to find that a middle-aged man in gray sweater rushed down the stairs and dashed toward her within several steps.</p><p>“You still have the guts to run, Li Xiaoqian? You still must go back with me whether you want it or not today, even if the sky is overturned as a result! It’s because of you that my face is almost gone!” After Tang Zhen caught up, he scolded and grabbed her shoulder.</p><p>Only at this time did Ouyang Lulu finally realize that the girl in her embrace was not calling her a pervert but this man. She immediately sent a kick after Tang Zhen approached, brushing past him and kicked him again.</p><p>“Fear not girl, I can pack him up since he’s nothing but a an old pervert!” Ouyang Lulu patted Li Xiaoqian’s back and comforted her.</p><p>Finally, Li Xiaoqian stood firm and brushed past Ouyang Lulu to hide behind her. She looked at Tang Zhen and shouted, “He’s an immoral bastard, a pervert and shameless man. He’s obviously my teacher and yet he wants me to accompany those damned men. Wu Wu Wu… he only watched as those damned rogues bullied me. Not only did he not help me, he also helped them. He’s really shameless…”</p><p>The weeping and wailing revelation from Li Xiaoqian stunned Ouyang Lulu, since it never crossed her mind that this middle-aged man in front of her turned out to be Li Xiaoqian’s teacher.</p><p>A teacher… how could a teacher do that, even worse than a beast?</p><p>He… he was not human!</p><p>Fury burst out inside Ouyang Lulu’s heart. After turning around to comfort Li Xiaoqian she rushed to Tang Zhen’s side, kicking him who was trying to crawl up and then sent several kicks again. Fortunately, today was snowing and she wasn’t wear her high-heels though she did dress-up casually. Else, the tip of her shoes would have claimed half of Tang Zhen’s life already.</p><p>“SCRAM! If you dare to play rogue again, I, your great aunt, will make you a living eunuch.”</p><p>The beaten Tang Zhen was perplexed. Little did he expect that someone would show up and disrupt him like Cheng Yaojin, more so that this was a female version of Cheng Yaojin. He wanted to fight back, but it was evident that he was not her match at all. Forcing himself to suppress the pain all over his body, he struggled to crawl up from the floor with difficulty after the woman stepped back and theb viciously glared at Ouyang Lulu.</p><p>“Eh…” Despite having been used to seeing beautiful women, Tang Zhen was still shocked upon seeing Ouyang Lulu’s stunning beauty. A disbelieving expression plastered itself on his face, for he didn’t expect that the woman who beat him turned out to be like an immortal fairy.</p><p>With furrowed brows, Ouyang Lulu’s mind still had the man’s impression whose glaring eyes were aimed at her. She raised her fist and yelled, “What the hell are you looking at? Really, you’re a damn rogue. Did you not believe that I, your great aunt, will not dare to castrate you?”</p><p>A chill ran down inside Tang Zhen’s heart and he immediately ran away. That woman was undoubtedly a stunning beauty who could topple a country, but was way too violent. He never wanted to turn himself into a living eunuch just because of a woman.</p><p>Ouyang Lulu snorted coldly before turning around to look at Li Xiaoqian, whose tears burst like raining pears. She sighed inwardly and comforted her, “Don’t cry anymore, girl. I’ve already drove out and beat that damned dreg!”</p><p>“Thank you. Thank you…” said Li Xiaoqian with a grateful expression as she wiped her tears, yet more tears kept falling down.</p><p>“There’s no need for you to thank me.” Ouyang Lulu shook her head. “That bastard deserves a beating. Let’s go to my private box and then tell me about what happened. I happen to know the owner of this club. Wait until I tell him, then he’ll send security guards to apprehend those damned rogues.”</p><p>“Don’t… they… they all are very powerful people. I’m afraid…” Li Xiaoqian spoke all of sudden upon hearing her words.</p><p>“Do they have very influential identities? What exactly are their origins?” Ouyang Lulu was surprised. “Ah, right, I still don’t catch your name. What do you do, girl?”</p><p>“I’m Li Xiaoqian, a freshman at the Regal Classical Music Academy,” said Li Xiaoqian amid her sobbing. “The man who just chased me is my teacher, Tang Zhen. He took me here to socialize and entertain the other three who are from the Blue City TV station. Two of them are the director and producer of the ‘I’m Crazy About Singing’ program, whereas the last one is an honored guest of the show. They wanted me to accompany them, saying that I would be guaranteed to secure a good place in the ‘I’m Crazy About Singing’ competition. I didn’t want to do that, so they…”</p><p>“What a group of filthy swine!” Ouyang Lulu cursed with clenched teeth and then pulled Li Xiaoqian towards the Supreme Hall.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
