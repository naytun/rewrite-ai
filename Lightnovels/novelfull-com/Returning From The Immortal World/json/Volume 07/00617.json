If anything, I did that in hopes that both of you wouldn't have any mishaps during your visit in our club.”</p><p>“Your club has already incurred my bad impression,” said Long Zhengyu indifferently. “Visitors are guests, and you are responsible for the safety of your guests. There are exceptions, however, and you are one. You are afraid of the power possessed by others and have little to no strength to boot in this Blue City.”</p><p>\"This…” Wang Zidong was a bit embarrassed. Long Zhengyu’s statement was indeed unpleasant to hear, but he knew that what he said was right. It was because of Du Yunjie’s identity that he failed in this aspect. Therefore, he took a stand and immediately stated, “That’s right, Young Master Long is correct in saying that our club does hold the responsibility to protect the safety of our guests. We neglected and didn’t pay the due care for it previously, but I assure you that a similar incident will never occur again in the future.”</p><p>Long Zhengyu still wanted to add more, but Tang Xiu stopped him, as he then chuckled and said, “Young Master Wang, right? Let us not mention about this vulgar matter, shall we? The Seacraft Hall is in a mess and we will compensate for your losses. Anyways, could you take them out of this box first? Don’t worry, though. We will not leave—you can count on that since we are waiting for his men to come. Or, are you going to… wait here and watch us eat?”</p><p>Wang Zidong nodded in response before shifting his sight to Du Yunjie.</p><p>Du Yanjie had seen many arrogant fellows, but never such an arrogant one. They still had the courage to eat while waiting for the enemy to come? Though he had guessed that Tang Xiu and Long Zhengyu possessed a certain identity, else they couldn’t become Huang Xu’s friends, where were they? This was Blue City! Regardless of their beings dragons or snakes in another place, Blue City was a territory where he reigned on top!</p><p>“I’ll give you face and allow you to eat to your heart’s content. I just hope that everything you swallow won’t come out after you get beaten!” Said Du Yunjie coldly before turning around and going outside. Two of his buddies were badly beaten, whereas the other two were fainted on the floor, so they had to summon the security guards to bring them out.</p><p>The messed and chaotic Seacraft Hall turned temporarily clean and orderly after the waiter was done cleaning. The tea table that was turned upside down had been straightened, but the crack on it was a testimony that a fight just happened a moment ago. Shortly after, fragrant dishes were delivered along with two bottles of Gods Nectar.</p><p>Tang Xiu was actually still alright since he had lunch quite late, thus he wasn’t that hungry at present. But Long Zhengyu woke up at noon and only ate an apple before rushing to Long’s Dining Hall to see Tang Xiu. He originally planned to have dinner in the Long’s Dining Hall but had his brain heated up by Tang Xiu and got swayed, so they decided to go to Blue City, thus the reason he hadn’t anything to eat until now. He was so starved that he was wolfing the dishes down.</p><p>In the next room, Du Yunjie was sitting while smoking on the sofa with a flushed face, whereas Wang Zidong held both his arms. There was a sympathizing look on his face whenever he glanced at Du Yunjing. He just couldn’t fathom that, just an hour or two ago, Du Yunjie provoked two silk pants who came from Shanghai, one of whom had his biological uncle as the second-in-command authoritative figure in Shuangqing Province. Therefore, Du Yunjie was humiliated, despite the place being his own domain, and even several of his friends got kicked a few times while some others got slapped in the face.</p><p>And the end result? The harm spread out to him by coincidence due to Huang Xu. The cause as to why he was sneered and jeered at by the other party without giving him the slight face at all was just because he said one or two words to help the fella.</p><p>Yet now, he even got into a troublesome matter at the Clearlake Club. Though he didn’t know that young man named Long Zhengyu, this guy was definitely not your common generation layman since Huang Xu looked very nervous facing him. And this time, Du Yunjie may have kicked an iron plate tonight.</p><p>“Zidong, what did Huang Xu say to you on the phone?” Asked Du Yunjie. He tried to restrain himself, but was finally unable to bear it any longer.</p><p>“I’ll tell you two things,” said Wang Zidong indifferently. “Firstly, they are his friends, and secondly, they have a very deep background!”</p><p>Du Yunjie frowned. He coldly snorted and said, “Hmph, even if they do have a deep background, they still must be obedient in Blue City. I will never believe that their backgrounds are bigger than that damn surnamed Zhang.”</p><p>“Even if their backgrounds are indeed inferior to that Zhang fella’s, provoking them won’t be that easy,” refuted Wang Zidong while shaking his head. “I’ve investigated this matter thoroughly, and it was you who incited this matter and provoked the other party first. I just hope that you are mentally prepared since it won’t be easy for this matter to conclude in a friendly manner.”</p><p>“Do you think I’m afraid of them?” Asked Du Yunjie in a heavy voice.</p><p>After sighing inside, Wang Zidong said, “Let’s not say whether you’re afraid or not first. But I think you should tell your brother about the matter here so as to prepare against contingencies, just in case.”</p><p>“Hmph, do you think I still have face to tell my big brother?” Du Yanjie hummed. “That surnamed Zhang really has a background in Blue City, and my big brother has already helped to solve it for me. If I were to call him again, do you think I, Du Yunjie, will still have face to socialize in Blue City?”</p><p>Wang Zidong fell into silence. He and Du Yunjie were old friends, hence the advice. But the fella himself gave a deaf ear to everything he said, thus he didn’t want to involve himself in this matter anymore. In any case, Huang Xu was kind enough to help him cover this matter and told him something. He decided to not easily jump into the problem before he could clearly figure out the origin of the other party, so it was best to avoid it and stay silent.</p><p>Quickly after, Huang Xu had returned back in a hurry to Clearlake Club and quickly rushed over after asking where Long Zhengyu and Tang Xiu were at. He then met Li Chunlei in the corridor and pulled him to a secluded corner to ask him about the truth of the matter, thus turning furious inside.</p><p>This fucking Du Yunjie, he just smeared this Father’s face with shame! Huan Xu cursed furiously inside. As he was about to set off to Seacraft Hall to apologize to Long Zhengyu, Li Chunlei spoke to him in a whisper, “Boss, Du Yunjie and Young Master Wang are in the other box, would you like to see them first?”</p><p>Huang Xu stared blankly for a moment before thinking about it. He felt that he should first reprimand Du Yunjie and then take him to the Seacraft Hall to apologize.</p><p>Creak...</p><p>The door to the next box was pushed open by Li Chunlei. After which, Huang Xu went inside with a grim face. His eyes only glanced at Wang Zidong before falling onto Du Yunjie’s ashen face and then indifferently said, “Recalling the account between us as old friends, and on the account of your big brother who has once helped me, I’ll give you an opportunity to go with me to the Seacraft Hall to apologize now. Otherwise…”</p><p>Huang Xu’s statement fanned the flames and incited Du Yunjie. He suddenly slapped the tabletop, got up and yelled, “Huang Xu, on which side are you standing? You want me to apologize to them, to those hillbillies coming from the countryside? How will I, Du Yunjie, still have a face with this shame in the future?”</p><p>Huang Xu narrowed his eyes and a cold glint flashed in his eyes. Then, he said with a cold and detached tone, “I think your face is not as good as your life. Yes, I know that they may be hillbillies in your eyes, people from low social strata. But I wanna I ask you something if you really are determined to lose all decorum with them. How much power do your Du Family need to destroy the Long Family of Star City? You will only kill 1,000 at the cost of the deaths of 800 of your men. Does your Du Family really want to pay such a big price?”</p><p>The Long Family from Star City?</p><p>Was it the Long Family who was now rapidly developing and became the first prominent family in Star City? Then, that guy named Long Zhengyu was from that Long Family?</p><p>“I can tell you something more.” Huang Xu sneered. “Long Zhengyu is the eldest son of Long Hanwen and is the future heir of the Long Family’s Head. He’s very powerful by himself, and 50% of the Long Family’s businesses are now under his flag, whereas Long Hanwen himself highly regards and favors him. If the Long and Du Families were to really fight, Long Hanwen will definitely not hold back all the power his family has to act for his son. Then, what will the Du Family do to help you?”</p><p>Du Yunjie’s gasped for breath as his expression grew cloudy and unsettled. He realized the reasoning in Huang Xu’s argument. Though the Long Family was headquartered in Star City, their strength was definitely terrifying. In the case that, as Huang Xu said, he and Long Zhengyu were to tear off all decorum, his family would definitely not be willing to wage war just for this matter.</p><p>However, he didn’t want to lower his head to apologize, either!</p><p>Du Yunjie fell into silence for a while before raising his head reluctantly, and then coldly said, “I’m going to end this matter at this point since I’m looking at your face, Huang Xu. Tell them to come over here to settle this matter.”</p><p>Apparently, Huang Xu also realized that this was probably Du Yunjie’s bottom line and felt somewhat helpless inside. However, he still said, “Come with me if you want to reconcile with them!”</p><p>Du Yunjie scrunched up before getting up and saying, “Let’s go then!”</p><p>Inside the Seacraft Hall.</p><p>Tang Xiu and Long Zhengyu were having their meal when they saw Huang Xu entering. There was a smile on Tang Xiu’s face was in contrast to the cold and detached as he glanced at him. He then smiled and greet Huang Xu.</p><p>“T-Tang… Brother Tang Xiu?”</p><p>Huang Xu was utterly taken aback. He never imagined that the person who came with Long Zhengyu turned out to be Tang Xiu.</p><p>This incident was troublesome!</p><p>He was perfectly aware of how ruthless and merciless Tang Xiu could be, and was crystal clear that he was not just solely the owner behind the Magnificent Tang Corporation. His identity was not that simple since he was Beijing’s…</p><p>Pa…</p><p>All of a sudden, Huang Xu turned around, slapped Du Yunjie’s face and bellowed, “You have killed me, you fucking asshole! I, Huang Xu, have done a lot of shameful things, but today… now… I wish that I could find a hole to burrow myself into!”</p><p>“WHAT THE…”</p><p>The slap made Du Yunjie perplexed and stunned. This wasn’t what they had agreed to previously, was it?</p><p>Tang Xiu pointed to the nearby sofa and smilingly said, “Well, Zhengyu hadn’t had much to eat today, so it’s best to wait until he finishes his meal.”</p><p>Huang Xu squeezed out a smile and nodded before forcefully pulling the perplexed Du Yunjie and then sitting on that sofa.</p><p>Finally, Du Yunjie snapped back to his senses. He subconsciously lifted his hand to touch his slapped chin as anger exploded inside his chest. He stepped back and pointed at Huang Xu, cursing angrily, “Are you fucking insane, Huang Xu? Spit it out if a problem crops up. What the fuck did you lash out at me for?”</p><p>“Will you fucking shut up?” Huang Xu was also incensed. “Get your fucking ass and sit down next to me!”</p><p>Flames of anger burst inside Du Yunjie’s eyes as he yelled back, “Huang Xu, you’re really a fucking trash. You of all people are siding with the outsides instead of your own people. I, this Du Yunjie, finally see through you. Hmph… I may dread you, but I was never once afraid of you! Do you want to stick out with them and then flush your shit on me?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
