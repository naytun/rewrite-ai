What he wanted the most now was straightly head to dreamland and have a date with Duke Zhou’s daughter. And yet, that brazen faced Xue Yu who kept close to him made him weary and tired.</p><p>However, he knew that Xue Yu would definitely open the door and enter his room if he did not give her spare clothes given her disposition. It was highly likely that she would go above board and want more. After struggling hard to stay awake, Tang Xiu sluggishly walked to the cloakroom and found several sets of new clothes Kang Xia bought for herself when she came over. Then, he took one set and also took a piece of underwear, albeit hesitating at first. After he walked outside, he then said, “Whether these suit you or not, just use them for tonight. We’ll go out and buy some for you tomorrow.”</p><p>Xue Yu took them without speaking. These clothes made her sure that Tang Xiu did not lie as he definitely had a woman already. Furthermore, she could tell that this woman should be quite busty judging from the model of the bra. She did not like her own conjecture at all, but she had no other choice. Upon seeing that Tang Xiu looked tired, her expression suddenly moved and said, “I’ll take a shower first, and then I’ll massage you afterward.”</p><p>With that said, she did not give Tang Xiu a chance to refuse and quickly turned back to the opposite room and slammed the door.</p><p>A massage?</p><p>Tang Xiu rolled his eyes at the shut door. After returning to his bedroom, he went straight to bed and tried to sleep, saving himself from having Xue Yu disturb him again. However, the more he wanted to sleep, the more he couldn’t. He only felt he was mentally tired and evidently had symptoms of insomnia.</p><p>He did not force himself as he felt that he really could not fall asleep at all, and quietly thought about what he would do next. Shanghai University had already started classes after the winter vacation. On one hand he had to go back to school to attend classes and on the other hand, he also had to start the construction project in Shanghai as well.</p><p>For that plot of land, Kang Xia had led several senior executives of the Magnificent Tang Corporation previously, and also contacted some government officials of Shanghai and spent quite a sum of money to buy it. Its location was rather remote, almost near the boundary with Su City, and yet was very expensive, while property rights were due for 50 years.</p><p>The construction must start after the New Year. It was a unanimous decision he and Kang Xia made, and both of them were rather confused since all the construction companies they were familiar with had their hands already full with projects. More so that the scale of their projects was very large, making them unable to invest more in a short term. They did consider cooperating with other large domestic construction companies, yet it needed to be analyzed first.</p><p>Eventually, they decided to conduct a tender in Shanghai, and those who had qualifications to bid in the tender were at least the top 20 major construction companies in China.</p><p>Tang Xiu was thinking about this matter and decided to set a bidding date half a month later. He also needed to consider other affairs in this span of time. For instance, tempering his body with a power generator. If it did work well and had the expected effects, he would carry on the plan on a large scale and would apply it for all the cultivators he groomed.</p><p>“A pity that the gravitational force of all the regions on Earth is almost the same. In contrast, there are some special star fields in the Immortal World with a particular gravitational force that would be great in tempering my men,” sighed Tang Xiu inwardly.</p><p>Umm?</p><p>Suddenly, his expression slightly moved as he suddenly remembered some high-tech means. If he were to employ some hi-tech means to create an area with increased gravitational force or some gravity chambers, it would not become an issue, would it?</p><p>As Tang Xiu thought up to there, he was a bit excited. If he could employ those hi-tech methods to create a gravity chamber that was several times higher than Earth’s gravitational force to temper a cultivator’s body, that would bring about an excellent effect.</p><p>No rush. When the research team has been transferred to Shanghai, it won’t be an issue to conduct the research in this area, though I still have to discuss it with Mo Yi in advance and try to recruit a lot of scientists and researchers in this field in a short time.</p><p>Time passed, and the more Tang Xiu thought, the more he felt fatigue, but various inspirations constantly emerged inside his mind. Only after the door was knocked and a beautiful figure entered his room did the various thoughts in his mind gradually returned to normal.</p><p>“You…”</p><p>Tang Xiu looked at the figure dressed in Kang Xia’s clothes. It was alluringly beautiful. The dazzling beauty, Xue Yu. Despite being used to see outstanding beauties, he could still feel his heartbeat increase and the increased secretion of his hormones. Her white skin was like a Mutton Fat Jade, smooth and bright, coupled with slim and tall flawless body with an untied opening of her outer upper clothes that revealed two satellites and its visible white ravine in between.</p><p>“I once learned a Miao massage from some elders in the clan. It has a soothing and treatment-like effect.” Xue Yu came to the bedside and stepped on the bed with bare feet.</p><p>Tang Xiu sobered up from his stunned state. He could feel the changes of his own little brother as he waved his hand and hastily said, “No no no. I’m afraid you can’t practice your massage on me. I’m dead tired after working hard for a long time. Just go to rest! I was actually nearly asleep when you entered.”</p><p>Xue Yu let out a faint smile and simply ignored Tang Xiu’s words. She straightly squatted down and pulled him from the bed. With the bedding pushed aside, she forcefully made Tang Xiu fall down.</p><p>“Ugh, just forget it. I’m an adult gentleman. If I don’t eat a beauty who is offering herself to me, then I shall offer my ancestor veneration towards Liu Xiahui.” Tang Xiu steeled himself and straightly turned over. He could feel Xue Yu sitting on his bottom, and despite being separated by their clothes, he could still feel the warmth transmitted from her body.</p><p>“Relax your body and ease your spirit.”</p><p>With hands gently leaning down, Xue Yu’s slender, jade-like fingers pressed Tang Xiu’s shoulders. As his body relaxed, her fingers gently massaged him.</p><p>It was comfortable. Tang Xiu found that Xue Yu’s massage technique was rather interesting as it could clearly press the route of acupoints, either pinching, rubbing, and kneading. She fully understood and thoroughly mastered the distribution of muscle strength of her body, while lightly rubbing the small crevices of the backbone, lightly pinching and pressing the muscles that could ease them, giving off a relaxed sensation and comfort from the inside out.</p><p>Gradually, Tang Xiu’s eyelids turned heavy, and the desire that was ignited a while ago subsided in the comfort. Drowning in drowsiness, he fell asleep under Xue Yu’s massage.</p><p>A smile outlined on the corner of Xue Yu’s mouth and climbed up her face. She only massaged Tang Xiu for a few minutes and he already fell asleep.... It gave her a sense of accomplishment. However, she felt both annoyed and helpless upon recalling as how resistant Tang Xiu was towards her.</p><p>After a long while, only then did Xue Yu stop massaging him. She gently got out of bed and pulled the quilt over Tang Xiu’s body. After all, she was still a woman who had never had sex with anyone before. Though she did show gestures of giving herself to him, yet a woman’s constraint nature and timidity inside her were actually there.</p><p>She might not resist if Tang Xiu really wanted her tonight. But it would genuinely create a feeling of rejection inside her. Fortunately, what happened tonight made her realize that this man was a good man and not a pervert who could not see a beauty.</p><p>The next day.</p><p>It was already eight in the morning when Tang Xiu woke up from his sleep. When he came downstairs, he saw Xue Yu donning an apron and sitting in the living room while quietly reading a magazine, whereas the housekeeper, Auntie Zhang, was wiping home appliances with a rag while stealing glances at her from time to time.</p><p>“Mr. Tang.\"</p><p>Upon finding that Tang Xiu had come down, Zhang Xinlan hurriedly straightened up her body and called out.</p><p>Tang Xiu nodded to her in response and said with a smile, “Did you have a great New Year, Zhang Xinlan?”</p><p>With a happy expression, Zhang Xinlan nodded and answered, “Your treatment toward us has been great, Mr. Tang, so my family passed a bountiful year.”</p><p>Tang Xiu nodded with a smile. Suddenly, he recalled something and put his hand into his clothes’ pocket and quietly took out two stacks of 100 yuan bills from his interspatial ring. After which, he said with a smile, “Aunt Zhang, I left Shanghai in a rush before the New Year, thus I forgot to send you a red envelope. Anyways, this is 20,000 yuan for both you and Aunt Liu; 10,000 yuan for each. It’s a red envelope for the two of you from me!”</p><p>“No need to do that, Mr. Tang.” Zhang Xinlan quickly waved. “The salary and benefits you give us are already very high, how can we…”</p><p>Tang Xiu walked towards her with a smile and then stuffed the money into her hands, saying, “Just take it, Aunt Zhang! It’s been quite laborious on you, so please don’t regard me as a stranger later.”</p><p>“This… thank you, Mr. Tang,” said Zhang Xinlan gratefully.</p><p>Tang nodded at her with a smile. Then, he looked at Xue Yu, who stood up and came to him stretching out her hand. That made him immediately baffled as he asked, “What are you doing?”</p><p>“I’ve given all the money I have to the elders of the clan when I left the Miao Region,” said Xue Yu. “I will no longer manage the family business in the future, and thus cannot receive money from the family for my spending. Besides, I’m your lover now, so you gotta spend money to support me.”</p><p>“I…”</p><p>Upon seeing a matter-of-factly expression on her face, Tang Xiu immediately forced out a bitter smile. He stuffed his hand into the pocket again to take out a bank card from his interspatial ring, then handed it over to her and said, “There should be some money in this card if I remember correctly. The PIN is written on the back.”</p><p>A content and satisfied smile appeared on Xue Yu’s face. After receiving the bankcard, she said, “I’ll look for a job in Shanghai after settling down. Alright, the breakfast is still in the kitchen, I’ll reheat it.”</p><p>At the side, Zhang Xinlan watched Tang Xiu and Xue Yu with a strange expression. Never did she dream that such an exquisite beauty who was much more beautiful than celebrities would actually be Tang Xiu’s lover. She had seen many of Tang Xiu’s female friends, such as Kang Xia, who had sex with him, Ouyang Lulu, who often came over, as well as Mu Wanying, his fellow student in the campus… Yet, it was her first time seeing this… lover. She secretly sighed inwardly and felt fortunate that Tang Xiu had not yet married, or else this lover would really have to sit tight in between.</p><p>“Miss Xue, let me do the reheating!” Yet, Zhang Xinlan did not look down on Xue Yu and hurriedly interjected.</p><p>“I’ll do that myself, Aunt Zhang.” Xue Yu shook her head. “I’m his woman, so I must take care of his daily life. Also, this medicated diet is very special, there are still many things in it that need attention despite only reheating it.”</p><p>Wearing an apron, it really made her look like a housewife.</p><p>Upon seeing that Zhang Xinlan would speak again, Tang Xiu immediately shook his head at her. Since Xue Yu was willingly serving him, he naturally had to take it for granted.</p><p>As it should be! Like a mistress who took her man’s money, they sometimes still need to do things to please her man as well.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
