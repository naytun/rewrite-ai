Moreover, Huang Xu also learned from Long Zhengyu that Tang Xiu was currently hot news, so he immediately notified all the employees who had seen Tang Xiu keep their mouths shut.</p><p>And therefore, Tang Xiu’s stay in Blue City for the next few days was very refreshing and tranquil. There was no interruption or disturbance from the media. He drank a bit of wine every day, tasted some delicacies, nested himself in the suite to read, cultivated and spent his time in a fulfilled manner.</p><p>\"It's snowing again.\"</p><p>Inside the most luxurious suite of the Clearlake Club, Tang Xiu stood at the window and watched the dancing snowflakes in the air as he sighed inside. Without counting the 10,000 years in the Immortal World, every time the snowy days came was the most difficult time for him and his mother back when before his 18s. In particular was the issue with heating, as it was so serious that it felt like being tortured.</p><p>Knock, knock….</p><p>The door was knocked and Tang Xiu was dragged back from his reverie. Following which, he waved his hand and a Primal Chaos Force stream was released and gently opened the door to a slit.</p><p>“Come in!”</p><p>Long Zhengyu, who stood outside the door, found that the door had slightly opened accidentally, then he pushed it and went inside. When he saw Tang Xiu standing before the window, he was immediately stunned and suspiciously looked around the room before he shifted his eyes back to him. Along with a slightly dumbfounded feeling, he immediately entered the room.</p><p>“Tang Xiu, I’m going to leave.”</p><p>“Then let’s go back together!” Tang Xiu smiled. “It’s been four plus days, it’s time to go back.”</p><p>“No, I’m going to visit the Nine Dragons Island.” Long Zhengyu quickly waved his hand. “All the workers there can’t go home to the mainland because of your request, so I still need to send the necessary welfare needs.”</p><p>“When will you be coming back?” Asked Tang Xiu.</p><p>“A week, at the most,” answered Long Zhengyu with a smile.</p><p>“Bring Mu Qingping and Yinyin with you when you come back!” Said Tang Xiu.</p><p>“You’re really good to your treasured disciple,” said Long Zhengyu with a smile.</p><p>Tang Xiu didn’t say more since Long Zhengyu didn’t understand the particular nature of the master-disciple relationship among cultivators—Master for a day was a Father for the rest of one’s life; even the elders in the Immortal World were sometimes more important than their biological parents. Ones’ parents may stay with them for some time but wouldn’t be able to accompany them for the rest of their lives. More so the eldership and Masters in the Immortal World possessed formidable cultivation, and the accumulation of attachment and emotions accumulated with the passing years and through millenniums were extremely deep.</p><p>Along with Long Zhengyu’s departure, Tang Xiu went back to watching the gently falling snow. He was somewhat hesitant to return to Star City now. His parents were still in the capital and he wasn’t sure what he was going to do there. There would not be much difference from staying in Blue City, either, even if he were to return back to Star City now.</p><p>“Forget it, then. I’m staying here for a couple more days! At least there are some people here to serve food and drinks for me.” Tang Xiu scoffed at himself as he let out a smile and stretched out his hand to shut the window.</p><p>“Umm?”</p><p>Suddenly, his expression slightly moved and his eyes fell through the window toward the parking area about 100 meters away. To his surprise, he actually saw an acquaintance there.</p><p>Li Xiaoqian?</p><p>She seemed to have gone to the Regal Classical Music Academy. Now that the schooling was on holiday, shouldn’t she return to Star City? How would she appear here? And those around her were unlikely to be her classmates either as they looked a bit older. Could it be that they were her family members?</p><p>Shaking his head secretly, Tang Xiu recalled that he and Li Xiaoqian were almost cut off from contact ever since they graduated from high school. He learned some things about her from Cheng Yannan when he was with the latter previously. Tang Xiu felt a bit strange when he remembered Cheng Yannan. He directly left for Beijing from Jingmen Island previously, whereas she kept staying in the Everlasting Feast Hall and then went to Clam Island with the experts of the Everlasting Feast Hall. Could it be that she hadn’t come back yet?</p><p>Tang Xiu took his mobile phone and dialed her cell number, but was unable to get through. He remembered the bitter experience Cheng Yannan had gone through, recalling that Chen Xuemei, who was still missing until now, he regretted and pitied the frustrating life these two sisters must have gone through. He used to be like them, suffering difficulty in life along with his mother in the past. He now had come out of that dark—gloomy world, whereas they were still trapped in it.</p><p>“I’ll help them out if the opportunity arrives!”</p><p>Closing the window, Tang Xiu got up and walked toward the door. Though staying all day in the suite was not stuffy and boring, he still wanted to go out. He didn’t feel like disturbing Li Xiaoqian though he saw her all of a sudden. Since their student’s years had ended, everyone had their own life path, and they wouldn’t have too much contact in the future if they didn’t partake in their life here and now.</p><p>Half an hour later, Wang Zidong, who was staying in the suite next door, was yawning in the sofa in boredom. The naked cover girl on the Playboy magazine he was holding couldn’t make him feel refreshed at all. All these days, he really wanted to get close to Tang Xiu, building up a bridge and cultivating friendship, yet it was unfortunate that Tang Xiu was always holed up in his suite every day and he could only see him several times during meal time.</p><p>“Aargh, forget it. I need to look for some chicks to spice up my life.”</p><p>Wang Zidong bounced up and grabbed his coat before walking out of the room. His handsome face changed all of a sudden when he came out of the building, as an infatuated expression filled his originally dulled, spiritless eyes, and transforming into a love-struck fool’s expression.</p><p>Just a dozen meters away from him, in front of a handsomely macho Hummer SUV, a girl clad in black leather attire and black sunglasses leaned on the car while holding the car keys in her hand. Her looks were perfect and that devilish-alluring figure altogether sent off a wild and dangerous vibe.</p><p>She was so stunning that it made his heart thump!</p><p>Wang Zidong seen and dated countless women, yet one this hot he had never seen before. She could make him so excited. After a few seconds in a daze, he rushed toward the girl before he snapped back to his senses.</p><p>“May I have the honor to treat you to lunch, beauty? Ah… right. I need to introduce myself. I’m Wang Zidong, one of the shareholders of this Clearlake Club.”</p><p>Ouyang Lulu pulled the sunglasses down to look at Wang Zidong and casually said, “Do you know a more beautiful girl than me?”</p><p>Staring blankly for a moment, Wang Zidong shook his head and smilingly said, “No.”</p><p>“Do you have tens of billions or nearly 100 billion in assets?” Asked Ouyang Lulu once again.</p><p>“No.” Wang Zidong was a bit bewildered, but still shook his head.</p><p>“What about fame? No need to be too famous, just enough to be well-known in our country,” said Ouyang Lulu with a contemptuous look as she asked again.</p><p>“I…” Wang Zidong’s lips wriggled. His fame in Blue City could be called as great, but saying that he was well-known in the country, how could that be possible? He was not a celebrity, for god’s sake! He shook his head again and said, “Not either.”</p><p>Ouyang Lulu rolled her eyes. Though her style was still alluringly fascinating, the attacking words that came next were not pleasant to hear, “Then why do you want to treat me to lunch if you have nothing? Just get a hump on! I have no use for an outwardly attractive but worthless man.”</p><p>Outwardly attractive… but a worthless man?</p><p>Wang Zidong was so dumbfounded that he couldn’t believe what he heard. This outstanding wild belle in front of him unexpectedly… called him as an embroidered pillow—and attractive but worthless man?</p><p>Suddenly, Ouyang Lulu seemed to think of something. She observed Wang Zidong and said, “Ah, forget it. It’s not like I can’t give you a chance. As long as you help me a bit, I can have you accompany me for lunch.”</p><p>With an expression of being at a loss whether he had to cry or laugh, Wang Zidong asked, “What should I do?”</p><p>“Do you know Tang Xiu?” Asked Ouyang Lulu. “It doesn’t matter if you don’t know, though. But since you’re a shareholder of this club, it should be easy for you to ask someone who knows and take me to him.”</p><p>Wang Zidong stared in a daze at Ouyang Lulu and his mouth opened wide. All of sudden, a bad premonition raised inside his heart. After a short while, he asked with probing tone, “Are you looking for Tang Xiu? Then, you and him…”</p><p>“Yeah, I came to find him. He’s my man,” said Ouyang Lulu.</p><p>Crack…</p><p>Wang Zidong thought he heard the sound of his heart breaking. Finding himself a woman who could make his heart so moved was very difficult, and yet this very one was unexpectedly Tang Xiu’s woman. This… what the fuck? What have I done to deserve this? If it was someone else’s woman, even if she was Huang Xu’s woman, he dared to snatch her. But he would never dare to have thoughts to snatch Tang Xiu’s woman in the slightest even if he were to be given a hundred more points of courage!</p><p>After straightening up his attitude and manner, Wang Zidong laughed at himself inside and said, “Ah, you turned out to be Sis-in-law. Tang Xiu should be in his suite! Come, I’ll take to him.”</p><p>Sister-in-law?</p><p>A smile outlined on the corner of Ouyang Lulu’s mouth as a satisfied smile plastered itself on her flawless beautiful face. It was just an address, but the favorable impression she had of Wang Zidong increased a lot. The two people then came to the suite where Tang Xiu stayed. After knocking the door without any response for a long time, Wang Zidong then contacted the staff of the club and learned that Tang Xiu went to the Movie & Music Hall.</p><p>Movie and Music Hall.</p><p>Inside the heated, luxurious movie hall, Tang Xiu nested himself on the chair in the last row as he drank his scented tea while watching the movie on the big screen. He wasn’t the least interested in the fragments of the movie due to his long life experience in the Immortal World, yet the Western sci-fi blockbuster still brought him a lot of inspiration.</p><p>The power of science of technology. Earth’s current level of science and technology was very weak as he had seen some races with more advanced technology. But after he rose to the level of Supreme, the science and tech of those tech races were nothing to him.</p><p>However, the interplanetary war played in the movie did make him feel that if he pushed the development of the technological power to the limit, even developing powerful hot weapons would make him able to create a formidable armed force in Star City. For instance, the interstellar battleship. If he could produce hundreds of millions of powerful interstellar battleships, it can definitely sweep through countless star territories.</p><p>And the Immortal World was like the Oriental Xianxia in and of itself, and the appearance of the tech races there looked like the ones in this sci-fi blockbuster movie.</p><p>Having a formidable force was something Tang Xiu was perfectly clear about. And if he could adopt others’ strong points while overcoming ones’ weak points, that was, to combine it with science and technological power, could he be able to accumulate stronger armed forces in a shorter amount of time?</p><p>“Unfortunately, that tech race I met at that time is residing at the Loose Spiral Shell Star Area, and I haven’t gotten hold of the technologies of their science and tech, else I would have definitely been able to make the level of science and tech on Earth progress by leaps and bounds, at least reaching the lowest level of a space science and technology civilization.</p><p>“But I can still design some tools and gadgets. Though they are small ones, it still should… create a huge sensation if it appears on Earth, shouldn’t it?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
