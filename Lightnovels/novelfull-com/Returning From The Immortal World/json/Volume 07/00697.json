The stores that could open its business here were all world famous brands. Some people even said that this place was set up for the rich to spend their money, that even the cheapest underwear or pair of socks sold here was priced at four digits.</p><p>“Who do you want to buy clothes for?” Asked Xue Yu with a curious face, since she learned from Tang Xiu that he wanted to buy a set of woman’s clothes.</p><p>Tang Xiu did not try to conceal it and directly answered, “It’s for Ouyang Lulu.”</p><p>Xue Yu had never heard of Ouyang Lulu’s name and naturally did not know who she was. She did not even ask what kind of relationship she had with Tang Xiu and asked directly, “How old is she and what’s the size of her body?”</p><p>“She’s about the same age as you, about 24 or 25 years old?” Tang Xiu shook his head with a forced smile. “As for the size of her body… well, I don’t know about it.”</p><p>Xue Yu pondered, and then asked again, “But you should know her height, right? Is she busty, and how about her figure? And also, her nature…”</p><p>Tang Xiu was rendered speechless and dumbfounded being barraged by Xue Yu’s series of questions. After a long while being at a loss whether he had to cry or laugh, he asked, “You need to know one’s nature if you want to buy clothes for that person?”</p><p>“That is only natural,” answered Xue Yu with a matter-of-factly expression. “I can determine what kind of clothes she likes if I know her character.”</p><p>Giving it a thought, Tang Xiu felt that what Xue Yu said was quite reasonable. With his description, Xue Yu straightly took him to several stores and finally chose a good coat, and then directly led him to a nearby underwear store and bought three sets of underwear that should be liked by a busty young woman.</p><p>After half an hour, the duo left the Golden Eagle Mall and stood outside at the entrance. Tang Xiu looked at Xue Yu and asked, “I already bought the clothes, do you have other plans?”</p><p>“Would you like to sit there with me? There’s a bit of an issue I’d like to ask you about,” said Xue Yu after hesitating for a short moment.</p><p>“What is it?” Asked Tang Xiu with a puzzled expression.</p><p>“It’s an issue related to an array,” said Xue Yu.</p><p>“You’re not even a cultivator, what do you need to know about an issue with an array for?” Tang Xiu was curious.</p><p>“You’ll know of it after you go with me,” said Xue Yu.</p><p>After hesitating for a short while, Tang Xiu decided to follow Xue Yu to the Tomson Villa. When he entered the villa, he saw that the place was still the same as before, even the quilt on the table was not moved or changed. When they came to Xue Yu’s bedroom, Tang Xiu took a fast glance around and immediately asked with a curious expression, “How do you have your meal here?”</p><p>Xue Yu seemed to recall about it and then said, “I’ve been studying the array ever since I came here, and I think I haven’t had any meals at all. Chu Yuan called me to go out and I planned to have a bite outside. Then, I finally bumped into you…”</p><p>Tang Xiu’s brows slightly furrowed. He took out the mobile phone to dial Mo Awu’s cell number and ordered him to go to a nearby restaurant to buy a meal and send it over. After that, he then said, “What exactly is the situation with the array you mentioned?”</p><p>Xue Yu then walked toward the dressing table, took out the yellowing book stitched with gold thread, and then handed it to Tang Xiu and said, “This book was given to me by the Ancestress. She told me that I should thoroughly study it so I can help you crack the array of that Immortal Trove. I was planning to crack it myself so as to make you feel that I’m a useful woman to you. But, after I studied it and even used a forbidden divination art, the divination was only able to reveal the fragments of its abstruseness, and I couldn’t fathom it after that.”</p><p>Tang Xiu took the book and read it. He immediately furrowed his brows, since the content recorded on the first page made him baffled.</p><p>The Six Starlight Array?</p><p>It was an array he had never heard of. What was even more baffling to him was that the more he read the contents along with scrutinizing the Six Starlight Array, the more his brows furrowed, until a 川 pattern was shown on his forehead. The array was that of an extremely uncommon type as it seemingly grouped into a pattern that did not conform to the common pattern of array design at all, with extreme intricateness and meticulous design. He once researched the totems of the Shaman Clan in the Immortal World, and he found that the pattern of the array outlined on it was somewhat similar to the totems of the Shaman Clan, but this Six Starlight Array was more profound.</p><p>“Xue Yu, tell me what you’ve comprehended about this Six Starlight Array,” said Tang Xiu after spending two hours reading more than twenty pages.</p><p>“What I understood about this Six Starlight Array is pretty shallow. My comprehension of its details is very few and far between, yet it is still quite broad and profound. For example, the most basic outline structure of the pattern based on the lines of points as its supporting frame, while the whole entity itself served as an overseer of the pattern. The segmentation constituted by multiple diagrams, with each diagram separated by a distance to be distributed over an area around the crux as its central point…”</p><p>“Wait!”</p><p>Tang Xiu’s eyes suddenly lit up and reopened the Six Starlight Array pattern in the chart. His fingers kept rubbing on it, while the trajectory of its paths rippled in his eyes: the basic point, the pattern route of the array, and its collocation…</p><p>The triangle served as its power, whereas the whole entity served as a furnace.</p><p>The steady stream flowed backward from the source, and once it was constructed with spiritual power, it would no longer be a simple array anymore. Feng Shui arrays generally only had one crux, while this Six Starlight Array was different as it had six cruxes with each serving as an additional crux that not only doubled its might but also repeatedly overlapped with each other to increase its might by dozens of times, and it was even possible that it could multiply the might for hundreds of times.</p><p>Tang Xiu remembered the cave where Western Nefarious Sangha planted the medicinal herbs. The inlaid Soul Tranquilizer Stone and the solidified Dragon Eye there were perfectly laid out to form this Six Starlight Array.</p><p>Whoosh whoosh whoosh!</p><p>Tang Xiu took out five pieces of jade from the interspatial ring. After visually measuring the distance between them and separately differentiating each according to the five angles of the Six Starlight Array, he then took a larger jade and placed it in the center position.</p><p>“Oh, it’s not correct?”</p><p>After designing the pattern, Tang Xiu found that this simple arrangement of the Six Starlight Array did not produce any effect at all, and also found some discrepancies as well.</p><p>“This Six Starlight…”</p><p>Suddenly, Tang Xiu’s expression changed and he immediately put down the book. He then looked at Xue Yu and asked, “Was it Old Blind who gave this book to you?”</p><p>“Yeah!” Xue Yue nodded.</p><p>“She misled me,” said Tang Xiu with an expression of being at a loss whether he had to cry or laugh. “This chart is simply a mistake, and this Six Starlight Array is just a prank. Anyways, I’m going to show you a new arrangement for this array, you can see it for yourself.”</p><p>With that said, Tang Xiu took another piece of jade from his interspatial ring and placed the other six in a different symmetrical orientation with the same distance separation from the center. Afterward, when he put the last large jade in the middle, he continuously drew the outline of the pattern, which in the end instantly stimulated it.</p><p>BOOM…</p><p>A dreadful aura formed on the table, as though a small windstorm had instantly smashed the table, penetrated the floor, and continued shooting down at an extremely fast speed.</p><p>\"Oops!\"</p><p>Tang Xiu’s face changed and instantly released his Primal Chaos Force to wrap the windstorm in nearly an instant and forcibly contained while removing the array at a very fast speed.</p><p>Xue Yu was forced back for seven-plus steps from the windstorm that had just formed. After everything vanished, her eyes stared wide with a look of disbelief within. She ran back in front of the table, looking at the tabletop and the floor below. She could see that a circular hole with a diameter of more than ten centimeters was created on the ground in the apartment below.</p><p>It had to be noted that her bedroom was on the second floor of the residential compound! Yet, it drilled down and penetrated two floors in a flash?</p><p>Tang Xiu awkwardly scratched the back of his head and said with a forced smile, “I forgot you’re living in a residential building, and neither did I expect that this array would erupt quickly the moment it was arranged. Luckily, I removed it in a timely manner. Had I been late by ten seconds, that windstorm would not only create the hole in the center, but would definitely destroy the entire building.”</p><p>The might of an array was something Xue Yu had never seen before. At this time, her heart was jolted after hearing Tang Xiu’s explanation, as it was her first time realizing how terrifying a cultivator was.</p><p>“You… can you teach me to cultivate and step into the Dao?” There was anticipation in Xue Yu’s eyes, but her nervousness was even more evident.</p><p>Tang Xiu pondered for a while before he slowly replied, “My cultivation system is different. Though, in fact, it would not be inferior to those cultivators in your cultivation system once you have a breakthrough.  For example, Old Blind. I know perfectly well about her strength, and even though some cultivators who are said to have a very good cultivation level, they may not be her match at all.”</p><p>“I want to cultivate on both,” said Xue Yu.</p><p>Recalling Old Blind’s aid in Kanas as well as considering that this woman did treat him well, Tang Xiu finally nodded and said, “Since you want to become a cultivator, then I’ll teach you a set of the Daoist cultivation system. Cultivating in both systems is actually easy, and though I’m not familiar with the circumstances with your cultivation system, I’m sure it won’t have a conflict. I have seen many people who cultivated in many different cultivation techniques. Some of them were even able to leave their marks in the world, while some others, however, were distracted and it held them back. Since you’ve made up your mind with this choice, it will be up to your diligence and hard work later.”</p><p>Tang Xiu was perfectly clear that even her closest person had a similar situation as Xue Yu, such as his disciple, Gu Yan’er, who was an immortal cultivator with a very formidable strength. Her cultivation level was already quite high, yet she also became an in-name disciple under the Heavenly Emperor Tian Ji, from whom she learned the deduction technique of Divinatory Art, and eventually found Earth.</p><p>“I can help find you a teacher if there’s a chance later.”</p><p>Tang Xiu’s smile turned somewhat wider, for he suddenly felt that turning Xue Yu into a cultivator would not be a bad thing. If Gu Yan’er could give her some pointers, perhaps she would also have a chance to ascend to the Immortal World in the future.</p><p>Xue Yu herself was unaware of what Tang Xiu was thinking, and asked curiously, “What kind of teacher, exactly? Is it a teacher who can teach me cultivation and step into the Dao?”</p><p>Tang Xiu chuckled, “She indeed can teach you a cultivation system and make you step into the Dao, but not only that since she also can teach you divinatory techniques. Furthermore, with her attainments in this aspect, not even the underworld nor the heavenly secrets are considered impossible subjects to her.”</p><p>“You’re kidding me, right?” Xue Yu shook her head. “Even if you do become a Divine Oracle, you’re probably…”</p><p>“Don’t look at this issue from the angle of your mortal eyes.” Tang Xiu waved his hand to interrupt her. “There are a lot of things you don’t understand. You will only know about the abilities possessed by Daoist cultivators or immortal cultivators when you’ve reached a certain level of strength.”</p><p>Xue Yu seemed to have a hazy notion about it and curiously said, “So, when will you teach me how to cultivate?”</p><p>Tang Xiu corrected her, “What I’m going to teach you is not a Daoist cultivation technique, but one of the immortals. But you must keep in mind that you are not allowed to pass this cultivation technique to anyone, no matter what.”</p><p>“I promise!” Xue Yu firmly nodded.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
