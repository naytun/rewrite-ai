He could clearly watch the scene of the intense and bitter fight between Daoist Qiankun and Old Blind. Experienced and knowledgeable he may be, yet the scene was so daunting that he was frightened.</p><p>Are they still human? Or some supernatural beings?</p><p>Jie Walie used to disdain the idea of Gods, ghosts and the likes away from his mind. But that intense combat scene midair was akin to a combat between celestial beings. It made him have no choice but to believe that there really was something in the world he did not understand.</p><p>At this moment, he finally understood why Tang Xiu asked him to hurriedly rush over to this place to notify his men, and even told him it was likely that he would have a hairbreadth escape situation. That was because what he must face was not ordinary people! Those people, each and every one of them could claim his life with a flick of their fingers.</p><p>“What’s the situation, Brother Jie?” His two men did not bring binoculars, so they were naturally unable to see the intense combat a while ago. One of them stared at Jie Walie’s palpitating expression and asked with a curious face.</p><p>Jie Walie turned his head with difficulty to look at his curious face and then replied bitterly, “I’m afraid we’re of no use at all. Even if we go there, there won’t be anything we can do and will only meet our death.”</p><p>“So, what are we gonna do?” Asked the man quickly.</p><p>Jie Walie fell silent for a moment and then whispered, “We’ll wait here. Since Tang Xiu asked us to come to notice them in advance, it means that he will come over as well. Everything is to be put on hold, and then we’ll discuss this again after he arrives.”</p><p>Outside the cave.</p><p>Daoist Qiankun was holding Jin Sijie’s arm as he quickly checked his injury after putting him on the ground. He did not go after Old Blind because the ultimate trump card he blustered out was just a bluff. He had been injured, and it was a very serious injury at that. Although he was confident that it was not as serious as Old Blind’s, yet he would only stimulate that old woman to stake everything with her life on the line if he kept pursuing, and he might also perish with her.</p><p>He did not want to die yet! Especially after finding out that there was an Immortal Trove in this place. He wanted to break through to the Nascent Soul Stage, continuing his lifespan for a few hundred years more.</p><p>“We need to recuperate.”</p><p>There was blood gushing out in his throat, but Daoist Qiankun forced it back inside. After he took Jin Sijie and carried him on his back, he shouted in a hoarse voice.</p><p>Jin Sijie’s internal organs were in a mess after Old Blind sneak-attacked him with the Buddhist bead. He was now in a crisis, and his life would probably be in danger if he did not have a timely treatment. Luckily, Tang Xiu gave him a Holy Healing medicine, and its efficacy had yet to be fully absorbed.</p><p>After sitting cross-legged on the ground, he did not hurry to cultivate but rather spoke in a hushed breath, “Master, those four bastards… their swords are definitely not magic weapons. I suspect that they are spirit weapons. Else, with their Early Foundation Establishment Stage cultivation, it would be impossible to severely injure me even if they did employ a sword formation.”</p><p>Spirit weapons?</p><p>A greedy light flashed in Daoist Qiankun’s eyes. But then he suddenly realized something and his expression turned nasty. If Tang Xiu’s men possessed spirit weapons, then what rank could his weapon be, considering that his status was even higher?</p><p>Immediately, he grabbed Jin Sijie’s arm again and shouted in a deep voice, “Don’t cultivate here, let’s leave this place immediately! We don’t know when that surnamed Tang punk will be back here. Let’s find a safe place first and then heal ourselves.”</p><p>In the next morning.</p><p>Tang Xiu led Mo Awu and five other experts out of the Kanas Airport exit. Ridden with worries inside, Tang Xiu did not catch a taxi but quickly asked around where the unlicensed taxis usually hung around.</p><p>“Hey, Buddy. Do you need a ride?”</p><p>More than a dozen unlicensed taxis were parked on the roadside. Some of the drivers wore bearded faces, and among a group of fierce-looking middle-aged men, one of them came to greet them.</p><p>“I need two cars. But I’m going to buy them. Name your price,” said Tang Xiu in a deep voice.</p><p>The more than ten bearded middle-aged men exchanged looks in wonderment. It was a situation they had never encountered in their many years of unlicensed taxi business. The full bearded middle-aged man who just greeted them hesitated before he stretched out a finger and said, “100 thousand. I’ll sell this van to you.”</p><p>Tang Xiu had planned to buy cars for temporary use after he got off the plane, and even had stuffed hundreds of thousand of yuan in cash into his travel bag from the stash inside his interspatial ring. The bag was now carried by Mo Awu, and after he heard the price quoted by the middle-aged man, Tang Xiu then nodded to Mo Awu.</p><p>Mo Awu opened the travel bag’s zipper and took out ten stacks of 100 yuan bills from it, a total of 100 thousand yuan, and then handed it over to the middle-aged bearded man.</p><p>“Key!”</p><p>The pupils of the middle-aged bearded man contracted, and the other unlicensed taxi drivers looked shocked. The way they looked at Tang Xiu’s group was now different than before at this moment. If it was not for the fact that Tang Xiu’s group consisted of six men and did not look like they were ordinary people, they would have tried to rob them.</p><p>“It’s yours!”</p><p>The middle-aged bearded man grabbed the money with pleasant surprise. After checking the money and determining that they were genuine bills, he gave the key to Mo Awu happily. His van was worth at most 40 to 50 thousand yuan, and though the meters it had run was less than 10,000 kilometers, selling it for 100 thousand yuan was definitely a big profit in and of itself.</p><p>A few hours later, Mo Awu drove the van and arrived at Longquan Swamp. The group left the car and quickly trekked up the mountain range and, without long, they had arrived outside the cave where Western Nefarious Sangha used to occupy previously.</p><p>“There are traces of a fight here, Boss. And it should be traces left by cultivators.” Mo Awu directly reported to Tang Xiu after he and the others scoured and inspected the vicinity.</p><p>Tang Xiu’s face looked a bit ugly as he quickly entered the cave. He could not find the shadows of Jin Shi’s group of four at all except for bloodstains left outside the cave and the scene left behind after the fight. One must know that Jin Shi’s group of four were core experts of the Everlasting Feast Hall and the talented ones whom Gu Yan’er had fostered and trained personally. It would be quite a big loss for him and the Everlasting Feast Hall if they were all killed.</p><p>“Jin Sanchi, Jin Sijie, you all fucking bastards! This father spared your lives because you two did not offend me directly. Had I known that you had such a sinister an idea, I would have completely killed you then.” Tang Xiu was somewhat annoyed with himself. He found that he had turned a lot softer inside ever since he returned to Earth.</p><p>“Was it because of the law, or did I get influenced by others, or was it the feelings of affection from my family?”</p><p>“But then again… weeding out grasses without removing its roots will only leave endless troubles in the future.”</p><p>“Then, in the future, as long as they are enemies, just kill them all!”</p><p>Tang Xiu’s eyes turned a bit red. He had searched both caves and there was still no trace of Jin Shi’s group of four.</p><p>“Boss, someone is coming!”</p><p>Just as Tang Xiu came out of the cave where the herbs were planted, Mo Awu whispered to him while holding a mini binoculars.</p><p>“Who is it?” Asked Tang Xiu in a deep voice.</p><p>“It’s a bit far distance, but they should be ordinary people since their speed is not fast,” answered Mo Awu. “No. I can see them now. It’s Jie Walie with his two men. They are coming here.”</p><p>Tang Xiu’s expression changed, and then he instructed Mo Awu and the others to immediately greet them. When he saw the distressed but unhurt Jie Walie, he cupped his fists and said, “Brother Ji, I won’t say thanks to you, but you can be sure that Tang Xiu will always record this huge favor in my mind. Just open your mouth if there’s any request you need of me in the future.”</p><p>Jie Walie’s expression looked a bit complicated as he looked at Tang Xiu for a while, and then let out a bitter smile as he said, “Who exactly are you, Brother Tang?”</p><p>Tang Xiu was silent for a while and asked, “Why the question?”</p><p>“I saw the intense and bitter fight between those people last night,” said Jie Walie. “Those people were like those the celestial beings and immortals in legend. They can fly in the sky and fight in midair. The means they showcased were absolutely not the kind that normal humans can do. So you should know what I’m asking about, Brother Tang!”</p><p>“You said that you witnessed the fight last night. What exactly happened last night? And who was fighting?” Asked Tang Xiu hurriedly.</p><p>Jie Walie could not wait for Tang Xiu’s reply, but after he saw the urgency and anxiousness in Tang Xiu’s tone and expression, he suppressed his confusion and seriously said, “I saw an old Daoist and an old woman fighting an intense combat. I also saw an old man in a man-eating fight with four young men. That’s right. Those four guys are your men.”</p><p>“Then what happened to them? What was the outcome of the combat?” Asked Tang Xiu in a rush.</p><p>“That old lady brought your four men and fled, whereas that old Daoist and another old geezer stayed in the cave over there for a while before leaving.” Jie Walie shook his head. “We were very far away from them and only saw through binoculars. So I don’t know where they went.”</p><p>An old Daoist and an old woman?</p><p>Tang Xiu frowned deeply. Little did he expect that two people would appear in the incident all of a sudden. If that old man was Jin Sanchi or Jin Sijie who fought Jin Shi’s group of four, then it could only mean something, that the strength of these old codgers was inferior to that old Daoist’s.</p><p>After pondering for a while, Tang Xiu asked again, “Brother Jie, I’ll answer that question of yours later. Please remember carefully. Other than my men, was there any special physical characteristics on the others?”</p><p>Jie Walie thought for a while and then suddenly remembered something as he quickly said, “That old Daoist looked very ordinary, and he did not have any special characteristics. But that old woman was actually a blind person. That’s right. Though I don’t know how she could see, there was definitely something wrong with her eyes.”</p><p>Old Blind?</p><p>A person suddenly crossed Tang Xiu’s mind. It was Old Blind who he once met in Shanghai’s Everlasting Feast Hall before. Could it be her who acted to save Jin Shi and the other three?</p><p>Tang Xiu took out a half pack of cigarettes from his pocket, lit one, and then took two deep puffs. After which, he looked at Jie Walie and asked, “Were you late when you came here, Brother Jie?”</p><p>Jie Walie forced out a smile and said, “I indeed arrived late. We just arrived at the vicinity and found some people in an intense fight. Brother Tang, you did not see it, those scenes were like…”</p><p>“Brother Jie, you must never disclose anything about what you saw last night,” interrupted Tang Xiu. “Since you want to know our identity, then I’ll no longer conceal it from you. We all are cultivators who have been cultivating special cultivation techniques and thus have special abilities as well. Only, people like us are not exposed to the public and ordinary people, neither will we expose ourselves.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
