Li Chunlei, however, didn’t want to summon them because he was very aware of Du Yunjie’s identity and guessed that Long Zhengyu and Tang Xiu were not ordinary people as well. Facing such a scene at this moment, his expression turned very serious as he spoke, “Gentlemen, I believe you also know the principle that the one at the post will worry about any matter concerned therewith. So to speak, I’m a manager of this club, so I’m the one responsible for the security. I’ve already reported the conflict between you to our shareholders, and one of them is already on the way here. I hope you can keep your emotions in check before he arrives and not take this matter outside.”</p><p>Having said that, he didn’t stay in the Seacraft Hall, because he couldn’t afford to involve himself in the arm wrestling between characters of this level, neither did he dare to be partial to any party at all. It was wiser for him to protect himself and play safe, for it was the only suitable choice for him.</p><p>Ten minutes later, Wang Zidong appeared before Li Chunlei along with several stocky men and indifferently said, “Where are they?”</p><p>While pointing at the door of the Seacraft Hall, Li Chunlei forced a smile and said, “They’re inside.”</p><p>Wang Zidong strode inside and was stunned. He never thought that such a situation had unfolded, with the four youths who were with Du Yunjie unexpectedly fallen on the floor and bleeding. He glanced at Long Zhengyu and Tang Xiu before nodding to Du Yunjie and asking, “Are you okay?”</p><p>“Hmph, I don’t want you to meddle in this even if it’s happening in your Clearlake Club.” Du Yunjie shook his head and snorted coldly. “The matter between us is for us to settle down, and we’ll conclude this in the Seacraft Hall.”</p><p>Awkward, Wang Zidong couldn’t smile in response. He then looked at Long Zhengyu and Tang Xiu as he asked, “What should I call the two of you?”</p><p>Tang Xiu only let out a smile and didn’t speak. It was Long Zhengyu who replied indifferently with squinted eyes, “Shouldn’t you be the one informing us of your role when entering the stage instead of asking us who we are?”</p><p>Wang Zidong couldn’t help chuckling, “Buddy, you should have come from another city, right? There are only a few people in Blue City who don’t know this Wang Zidong.”</p><p>“We came from the countryside, and there’s nothing we can show off to widen your knowledge and will only be a laughingstock for you,” sneered Long Zhengyu.</p><p>Wang Zidong’s brows slightly furrowed and the smile on his face receded, as he then said, “I have to advise the two of you politely. You too know that a dragon can never repress a local snake regardless of how formidable it is. This place is Blue City. You may have a very strong capital in other places, but you had better restrain yourself here. Give me face and I can give you a good solution for this matter.”</p><p>Tang Xiu suddenly smiled, “Young Master Wang, yes? Alright, we’ll give you face since this is your turf, after all! However, you must ask this kiddo first, is he willing to give you face?”</p><p>Du Yunjie suddenly stood up from the sofa and angrily yelled, “Zidong, they are too arrogant. I absolutely won’t let this matter go if I don’t discard them! If you still regard me as your friend, I hope you won’t involve yourself in this!”</p><p>With discontent on his face, Wang Zidong said, “Young Master Du, are you trying to make things difficult for me? I know you feel chagrined by someone else today and bottled up your blazing anger inside. How about I go to the Cloud Palace to find their two best chicks? You can vent your fire tonight and conclude this matter here, okay?”</p><p>Du Yunjie replied in a heavy voice, “Qiangzi should be here with our men here soon. You should know well about his character. However, if you want me to conclude this matter, they must kneel down and apologize to my four brothers and then fork out several million yuan for their medical expenses.”</p><p>Wang Zidong fell into silence. He knew who Qiangzi was; a famous man in Blue City due to his ruthlessness, very formidable martial arts, and his own capital coupled with a gang of desperados gathered under him. Only a few people in Blue City dared to provoke this man. With the Du Family possessing an official background and its young master—Du Yunjie as his backer, he was naturally willing to fight for him. Half minute later, Wang Zidong let out a sigh before looking at Long Zhengyu and asking, “Did only the two of you come to Blue City, there’s no one else?”</p><p>“Yup, only us!” Said Long Zhengyu with an indifferent expression.</p><p>Wang Zidong shook his head, “In this case, I can only advise you to comply with what he said. Apologize and take out several million for compensation to conclude this matter.”</p><p>“Interesting, this is really amusing.” Long Zhengyu grinned. “But what if I refuse?”</p><p>“I think it will be difficult for you to walk out of the club’s door with your limbs intact then, so I’m kindly telling you out of good intentions,” said Wang Zidong with a serious face.</p><p>Be it either Du Yunjie’s arrogance or this kind of good intention from Wang Zidong made Tang Xiu a bit angry and disgusted inside. He never liked this kind of silk pants, young masters’ attitude to begin with. He lit up a cigarette and indifferently said, “Thanks for the good intention. You can go to tend your things if you have nothing else to do here.”</p><p>With a slight change in expression, Wang Zidong deeply gazed at Tang Xiu and said in a deep voice, “Two gentlemen, since you insist on doing this, then don’t blame me for not reminding you. We won’t take responsibility if you some mishap were to happen to you here.”</p><p>Then, he stepped out of the door after saying that!</p><p>Li Chunlei followed behind Wang Zidong. After they came to the corridor, he quickly chased him and whispered, “Young Master Wang, there’s something that I didn’t have time to tell you on the phone since you hung up. These two guests from another city, they said that they are Young Master Huang’s friend.”</p><p>Staring blankly for a moment, Wang Zidong then rolled his eyes and said, “What Huang Xu’s friends? He has many friends, who knows where they come from if they only claim to be his friends?” Even though he said, however, he still inquired further, “What do you know of them?”</p><p>“I only know that one of them is surnamed Long.” Li Chunlei shook his head. “But I don’t know anything about the other one.”</p><p>Family name Long?</p><p>Stunned and taken aback, Wang Zidong took his mobile out to dial Huang Xu’s number. After finding out that his call didn’t connect, he dialed another person’s number and then said, “Tell Huang Xu to answer my call.”</p><p>A short while after, Huang Xu’s voice came from the mobile phone, “It’s me, what’s up?”</p><p>“Do you have a friend with the family name Long?” Asked Wang Zidong.</p><p>At this time, Huang Xiu, who was still in the villa complex, furrowed his brows and waved to the young man behind him, hinting him to replace his position. After which, he walked to the side and said, “He’s a good friend of mine. Why are you asking about him?”</p><p>“There are two young men in the club, the ones who have a conflict with Du Yunjie,” said Wang Zidong. “The four friends brought by him here have been miserably beaten, and I heard from Li Chunlei that these you young men claimed to be your buddies.”</p><p>With a changed expression, Huang Xu replied in a deep voice, “I see, I’ll be there at once. Do remember, you must keep the situation in check before I get there!”</p><p>“Roger that!” Wang Zidong replied, and there was a trace of puzzlement on his face.</p><p>At this moment, Huang Xu’s complexion was very unsightly. He took out his mobile phone from his pocket but then recalled that it was broken after falling before. Then, he immediately took someone else’s mobile and dialed a certain cell number.</p><p>After Wang Zidong hung up the phone, he then returned to the Seacraft Hall. As he was about to speak, he heard the ringtone of Long Zhengyu’s mobile phone ringing.</p><p>Long Zhengyu had just lit up a cigarette at this time. After taking out his mobile and looking at the screen, he saw that it was an unfamiliar number, yet he still connected it and lightly said, “Long Zhengyu speaking, who am I speaking with?”</p><p>“Hello, Young Master Long, where are you now?” Huang Xu’s voice was heard coming out of the phone.</p><p>After tilting one of his legs, Long Zhengyu sneered, “Young Master Huang is truly acting refined and great today, eh? You still care about where I’m at today, huh? What’s up? Are you gonna join these young master silk pants of Blue City since you feel that Long Zhengyu is so easy to bully?”</p><p>Huang Xu gripped the mobile phone and force out a wry smile. He could already tell who was in conflict with Du Yanjie from Long Zhengyu’s tone and words. “Young Master Long, I’m in the wrong. I will catch up with you at once. I’ll apologize and make it up to you when I get there.”</p><p>“No need for compensation. But we are starving!” Long Zhengyu replied indifferently. “Tell your people to not stutter and serve us before this Great Young Master Du’s men come, so as to avoid we collapsing not because of us getting beaten by others, but because we are starving!”</p><p>“I’ll immediately tell them.” Huang Xiu hesitated a bit before replying, “That’s right, you mentioned ‘we’. Who is…”</p><p>“You still have a relaxed mood to fart over this?” Long Zhengyu angrily yelled. “Today you disgraced yourself! If I had known this earlier I wouldn’t have come to this lousy place of yours!”</p><p>After saying that, he hung up and panted with rage!</p><p>Huang Xu was utterly dumbfounded. He had known Long Zhengyu for a long time and never once seen him become this angry. He rushed out so hurriedly that he forgot to give back the mobile phone to his friend on the mahjong table.</p><p>Inside the Seacraft Hall…</p><p>Wang Zidong was also taken aback since he never imagined that Huang Xu would make a phone call to the other party just as he returned to the box. What shocked him the most was that the young man called Long Zhengyu spoke in an angry tone, not giving him any face at all.</p><p>In an instant, he suddenly felt that Du Yunjie would meet his rotten luck today.</p><p>At this moment, Du Yunjie was also stunned. He was usually very smart, but today he was fuming with anger without anywhere to vent it out. He then lashed out on Tang Xiu and Long Zhengyu. But after he heard the call received by Long Zhengyu, he realized that the person who called him should be Huang Xu.</p><p>He was not afraid of Huang Xu, but he was very afraid of the extraordinary consequences nevertheless.</p><p>Less than half a minute later, Wang Zidong’s mobile rang. Just as he answered it, Huang Xu’s voice came out, “Zidong, immediately order the people in the kitchen to prepare a meal for my friends, and do it at the fastest speed! Do remember, these men have a very special identity, so you must keep the situation in check before I get there!”</p><p>“I…”</p><p>Wang Zidong opened his mouth but didn’t know what to say all of a sudden. When he recalled what he had just said to Long Zhengyu and Tang Xiu, he gulped down and smiled bitterly before replying, “What the fuck have you done to me? If I knew earlier that they were your friends, I would have fucking rushed here and involved myself! Bah, forget it. I got it!”</p><p>After hanging up, he then immediately looked at Li Chunlei and said, “These two guests haven’t had their meals yet. Go to the kitchen and tell them to make their meal at the fastest speed possible!”</p><p>“What exactly is going on?” Li Chunlei was struck dumb, whereas Du Yunjie was dumbfounded.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
