He thought that if he left in such a crestfallen manner today, it would not take long until he became a laughingstock in the business community, so he slowly said, “We had a gamble and I lost, so this 20 million is yours, Mr. Tang. Everyone loves beauty and so does Chief Zhang who likes Chief Mu, the reason why he pursues her regardless of everything. Please don’t stoop down to our level since you’re a much better and more magnanimous person, Mr. Tang. Please give him a way out to make a living!”</p><p>Looking at Wei Zongchao’s relaxed expression, Tang Xiu slightly furrowed his brows. He thought for a while, and then took out his mobile phone to dial Hao Lei’s cell number. After Hao Lei’s respectful voice came out from the mobile phone, he directly asked, “How much do you know about the Blessed Fortune Jewelry?”</p><p>“It’s a small jewelry company whose survival depends on our Grand Fortune Jewelries, Boss. The Everlasting Feast Hall is currently holding 20% of its shares, and the source of their goods are also provided by Grand Fortune Jewelries’ channels. The company is headquartered in Shanghai, and its General Manager, Wei Zongchao, holds 55% of the company shares…” answered Hao Lei.</p><p>Right as an unusual expression appeared on Tang Xiu’s face, Wei Zongchao’s face turned vigilant, and he said slowly, “I want to see the Blessed Fortune Jewelry go bankrupt and Wei Zongchao have nothing left anymore. I’ll hand this matter over to you, and I want the result within a week.”</p><p>“Understood!” Replied Hao Lei respectfully.</p><p>Tang Xiu hung up the phone. After stuffing his phone, he sneered, “You still appeal for another’s mercy and not start to request for your own good fortune? You can be sure that you will regret what you did today within a week, for I’ll make sure to make it happen.”</p><p>Wei Zongchao suddenly got up and intently stared at Tang Xiu, and asked, “Who exactly did you call?”</p><p>“An employee, or rather, my subordinate,” said Tang Xiu faintly. “I think you should know her name, though. She’s Hao Lei, the person in charge of the Grand Fortune Jewelries.”</p><p>Wei Zongchao’s body shivered and his legs turned weak as he directly slumped on the sofa and shouted in disbelief, “THIS IS IMPOSSIBLE! How can you know Chief Hao Lei? You… you’re bullshitting me! The Grand Fortune Jewelries is a very prominent business in Hong Kong, even if you do have a very good network in the mainland, it’s impossible for you to have any influence there.”</p><p>As he said that, he seemed to realize something and quickly grabbed his mobile phone and dialed Hao Lei’s cell number. After his call was connected, he squeezed out a smile and his tone turned very respectful as he said, “Hello, Chief Hao, I’m Wei Zongchao from Blessed Fortune Jewelry. It’s been a while since the last time I met you. Anyways, my wife recently got a top perfume from France. When do you have some time? How about I personally visit you in Hong Kong and bring it to you?”</p><p>Hao Lei’s cold voice came from the mobile phone, “I don’t know how and why you offended my Boss, Wei Zongchao. But if you’re tactful and sensible enough, you had better transfer your Blessed Fortune Jewelry shares to the Grand Fortune Jewelries. Otherwise, you can be sure that I’ll use every means necessary to make you have nothing left in this world, and also send you away to a mine in Africa to die working to the bones.”</p><p>“WHAT?” Wei Zongchao exclaimed. The mobile phone in his hand instantly fell to the floor and he slumped in the sofa with a face devoid of color. It was like all the strength in his body was siphoned away at this moment. Hao Lei’s words were like a Thunderblast in his heart that shook him, making him perplexed to a megrim state.</p><p>The time ticked by bit by bit in a bizarre atmosphere.</p><p>As Wei Zongchao sobered up from his languishment, he raised his head with difficulty to look at Tang Xiu. Under the gaze of Mu Wanying and Zhang Danyang, his body swayed and knelt down in front of Tang Xiu, begging with a trembling voice, “I’m aware it was me who took the road to ruin myself, but could you consider the elderly and the young in my family and spare me this time? I’m willing to transfer 40% out of my 55% shares to the Grand Fortune Jewelries, while I keep the remaining 15% to allow me to live in retirement and to support the young in my family. Is this alright with you?”</p><p>“Logically speaking, I should be ruthless and not spare you. But given that you did not go too far in this matter, so be it!” Said Tang Xiu calmly. “However, you won’t keep that 15% shares, but will exchange it to cash and then find a place to live out your life in retirement!”</p><p>“Yes yes yes. Thank you, Mr. Tang.”</p><p>Wei Zongchao wiped off the sweat on his face and got up in trepidation. He did not glance at Zhang Danyang again and left, battered out of his senses.</p><p>As Zhang Danyang found that Tang Xiu’s eyes caught him, he suddenly tensed up. He did not kneel down but put a very low gesture and beseeched piteously, “I’m willing to take out another 20 million yuan, Mr. Tang, and give all of it to you in compensation for spending your time. My company has been in business for decades, and it’s been with great difficulty that I brought it to its current state. Please spare me, do not punish me too heavily. Can you let me go this once? I swear that I’ll hide far away and never ever appear in front of you again.”</p><p>Tang Xiu raised his brows, looked at Mu Wanying’s tranquil expression and waved at her. After getting up and walked outside, his voice then sounded into the room, “You have three days to fulfill your commitment. I’m sure it will be very difficult for you to base yourself in Shanghai anymore in the future given the trouble you caused today. You had better think of leaving Shanghai and do your business in some other place!”</p><p>General Manager’s Office.</p><p>After Mu Wanying entered the room, she closed the door with her backhand and looked at it directly. With nearly no delay, she rushed towards Tang Xiu and straightly hugged him, leaving him baffled.</p><p>“Thank you!”</p><p>The words came from the bottom of Mu Wanying’s heart. She was secretly rejoicing that Tang Xiu came to her company and was very moved for everything Tang Xiu did for her. Else, she could have a bellyful of anger and unable to utter anything facing those two shameless and despicable low lives, and even lost some of her business.</p><p>It was a blessing in disguise! This sentence truly depicted the situation she was currently in. And what had happened today made Mu Wanying, who was proud deep down inside, realize how important was it to have a man who would shelter her from the wind and rain, and took her to the safe and blissful harbor.</p><p>“There’s no need of ceremonial talk between us.” Tang Xiu patted her back and smilingly said. “Anyhow, the trouble has been solved and your business will become more and more prosperous later, and you’ll probably be very busy too. But, it won’t affect your schooling, right?”</p><p>Mu Wanying released Tang Xiu, shook her head and said, “No, it won’t. The schedule for a graduate student is very relaxed. Besides, I already finished the subject I must study, so I don’t need to attend classes on the campus next semester. As long as I do my reviews regularly, I can complete the final graduation thesis.”</p><p>With that said, she seemed to recall something and quickly asked, “You just contacted so many people today, will it affect you? If it will, I can return all the deposits, and…”</p><p>Tang Xiu raised his hand to interrupt her and smilingly said, “No worries! It won’t affect me whatsoever. I spared those two guys because they reminded me of one thing. I myself have my own network, and it would be wasteful if I don’t use it. In any case, they also need to find an advertising company to cooperate, to begin with. Since we can earn money, there’s no reason to shy away from it!”</p><p>A smile outlined on the corner of Mu Wanying’s mouth. The “we” word used by Tang Xiu was like a sweet honey poured into her heart, giving a sweet feeling to her whole being.</p><p>At midday, Tang Xiu stayed at the Grace Regale Advertising with Mu Wanying and had a lunch together before he left. He had pulled in many businesses to Mu Wanying, thus she might be very busy in the following days.</p><p>On the way back to the Bluestar Villa, Tang Xiu then remembered Ouyang Lulu, who should still be asleep at his home. After hesitating, he decided to head to the nearby shopping mall to buy her new clothes. After all, he was rather extreme last night by directly ripping her clothes.</p><p>However, in regards to buying clothes for a woman, especially underwear, he was but a green rookie, and this made him helpless. After giving it a thought, someone appeared inside his mind- Yue Kai. This guy possessed quite the potential to become a playboy, as his inherent nature was one of being flashy and showy. It’d been half a year studying in Shanghai University, and Tang Xiu heard him talking about seven or eight girlfriends already. The speed he changed his girlfriends was even faster than getting new clothes. So, he thought that this guy was very experienced at buying clothes for women.</p><p>Golden Eagle Shopping Mall.</p><p>It was a high-end shopping mall in Shanghai, with rows upon rows of stores with dazzling goods anyone wished to find. Yue Kai held a handbag in his armpit while biting a toothpick. He dressed up neatly and was strolling around accompanied by a pretty girl he had just acquainted himself with for about ten days.</p><p>“I want a Hermes bag, honey.”</p><p>The pretty girl pulled Yue Kai’s arm with a coquettish manner. Her bright eyes were constantly sweeping through each extravagant shop.</p><p>A Hermes bag?</p><p>Inwardly, Yue Kai shivered. Though his family was indeed rich, and his mother secretly gave him more money regularly, his monthly allowance was only 20,000 yuan. Not to mention that he was also a spendthrift, the 20,000 yuan he got after the New Year now remained only 8,000 yuan.</p><p>However, he still had a credit card with a 100,000-yuan limit. But, it could be said that this credit card was like his immovable property, and he did not want to use it unless he came across something that forced him to use it as a last resort. He wanted to refuse his new girlfriend’s request, but looking at her pretty face as well as her coquettish and seductive voice, he did not have the heart to reject her. After some hesitation, he finally nodded and said, “Since you want it, then let’s buy it.”</p><p>“You’re really handsome, honey.”</p><p>The girl looked pleasantly surprised, and then stood on her toes to kiss Yue Kai’s cheek.</p><p>Yue Kai grinned and smilingly said, “Of course, I am. Even those Korean stars are not qualified to even carry my shoes. Anyways, if I hadn’t booked a room at the Shangri-La Hotel to have a pleasant night with you tonight, I would have directly brought you to Jingmen Island to ride a yacht.”</p><p>The girl’s eyes turned brighter, but she intentionally turned her head with a shy expression and said, “I do want to go to Jingmen Island to ride a yacht.”</p><p>“I wish I could!” Yue Kai regretfully said. “Unfortunately, I don’t have much time. Wait until my school holidays later, then I’ll take you to Jingmen Island to have some enjoyment.”</p><p>Ring ring ring…</p><p>At this time, the ringtone of his mobile phone sounded.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
