The pain made Tang Xiu feel like he was reviving the time when he crossed the tribulation.</p><p>The power of thunder and dreadful lightning. It had made a lot of powerful cultivators and high cultivation level Immortals alike perish. Thunder and lightning was a force of nature and the energy of the cosmos that was one of the absolute elements in destruction.</p><p>40,000 volts of electric voltage in its strongest state made Tang Xiu’s body slightly tremble, yet he felt that this was not his limit, as it was unable to stimulate his potential and only had a slight effect in increasing the intensity and strength of his body.</p><p>“Increase it by 20,000!” Words came out from Tang Xiu’s mouth.</p><p>The expression on Chu Yuan’s charming face turned very splendid. 40,000 volts in its heaviest electric current state was able to kill an ordinary person instantly, and yet Tang Xiu was just trembling slightly as though it was unable to injure him.</p><p>This… even if this guy was a cultivator, he shouldn’t be this terrifying, right?</p><p>Chu Yuan thought that he had seen too many unthinkable matters in his life, yet the present scene before him was even more outrageous than anything he had encountered before. What made it hard for him to accept was that this guy claimed that he was using the electric current for… bathing.</p><p>The highest current of 60,000 volts finally made Tang Xiu’s face turn slightly pale, with sweat appeared on his forehead. But the sweat was instantly evaporated by the high voltage right as it emerged. His hair turned erect and a faint redness could be seen on his skin.</p><p>The pain was simply outrageously painful. Yet, Tang Xiu endured and suppressed it and was even struck with intense surprise, because he found his body was being tempered by the electric current. The current damaged his muscles, but the Primal Chaos Force flowed to recover them extremely fast as the current constantly tempered his bones, making it firmer and tougher.</p><p>What surprised him the most was that the stimulation it brought to his internal organs, as it operated twice faster as usual under the current voltage. However many times they were injured, the Primal Chaos Force nourished and repaired it constantly; he could clearly sense that his internal organs were getting stronger by the tempering.</p><p>“Awu, 100,000!”</p><p>Tang Xiu’s eyes were faintly red and his hands that held the wires slightly trembled, but he still ordered categorically.</p><p>“You… are a lunatic!”</p><p>Chu Yuan was shivering and staggeringly stepped back until his back touched the wall. The expression in his eyes when he watched Tang Xiu was like watching a dead man.</p><p>Zzzt  zzzt…</p><p>The powerful electric current burned the only underpants on Tang Xiu’s body and turned it to ashes, yet neither the burning underwear nor the electric current inflicted serious injuries on Tang Xiu.</p><p>The pain was stabbing, but it still made Tang Xiu excited.</p><p>His nerves were as though being cast and turned into steel, and his blood seethed like a boiling magma. His streamlined muscles were beating and shivering, but the grey substances just excreted out on the surface of his body were burned into a solid state.</p><p>Standing by the power generator, Mo Awu’s eyes were frantic and filled with reverence. He could clearly sense the high temperature contained within his Boss’ body. Witnessing his Boss’ ability to endure it, an intense desire birthed inside him… to become stronger. He wanted to become stronger and more formidable so that he could easily take a shower in the electrical current and bath in lightning.</p><p>Chu Yuan, who leaned against the wall, finally gasped for breath. He felt his heart beating faster and his legs turning weak as if all his strength had been siphoned away.</p><p>It’s really appalling! Is he still a human being?</p><p>He wanted to turn around and ran away from this place because he did want to stay with these lunatics and neither did he want to get along with this horrifying monster. And yet, he could not take a step because he wanted to see the entire process and final result of this monster, of Tang Xiu’s words about him “taking this kind of bath”.</p><p>Time passed by second by second, and 20 minutes were gone in the blink of an eye. Tang Xiu suddenly put away the two thick wires and laughed loudly, “THIS IS GREAT! SO DAMN GREAT!”</p><p>Mo Awu strode forward and hurriedly asked, “How effective was it, Boss?”</p><p>Tang Xiu turned his hand to take out a set of clothes from the interspatial ring. After quickly putting it on, he said with satisfaction, “It’s not bad. I can feel the increase in my body strength. Awu, pass my message. Assign someone to buy at least 100 power generators for normal training.”</p><p>“I’ll contact Little Boss later,” said Mo Awu excitedly.</p><p>Tang Xiu nodded at him and then looked at Chu Yuan, who was leaning against the wall, and found that the guy looked pale and was wearing a disbelieving expression. He let out a smile and lightly said, “Mr. Chu, it was not very elegant of me to get naked due to the bathing a while ago. But the taste was kind of great, though. Do you want to try, by chance?”</p><p>Chu Yuan gulped down, shook his head and said, “You’re really a lunatic! Only a lunatic could do that, so I’ll pass the offer. I don’t want to kill myself.”</p><p>A madman?</p><p>Tang Xiu couldn’t help laughing, “Alright, just forget it since you don’t wanna try. Pity, though. Bathing in electrical current is really nice, you know.”</p><p>Taking a deep breath, Chu Yuan quickly adjusted his mood and slowly said, “You were not having a bath at all. You should be using the electricity to temper your body.”</p><p>“Alright, I won’t tease you any longer.” Tang Xiu smiled. “I’m indeed using the electric current to refine my body. Unfortunately, my strength is not much, since I use too high a electric current else I will be electrocuted. Sooner or later, however, the largest power station in the world will become my bathhouse, and I can use the thunder and lightning from the sky to rub my back. Hahaha…”</p><p>The happy occasion caused him to be in good spirits, so Tang Xiu’s attitude towards Chu Yuan turned better.</p><p>Listening to Tang Xiu’s words made Chu Yuan speechless. And yet, beneath the surface, it also aroused deep envy inside him. He also wanted to possess formidable strength, wanted to use the electrical current to temper his body and finally have thunder and lightning rub his back in the future.</p><p>That was a cultivator! It was a role he had been dreaming for countless times. Pity that his Imperial Garden’s centuries of inheritances had not obtained any cultivation methods at all. Though his martial strength could be said to be not bad, he was only able to deal with some small gangsters and was also half a step away from those martial arts grandmasters.</p><p>Is it possible to make a business deal with Tang Xiu? I don’t care how big the price is as long as I can get a cultivation method to become a cultivator!</p><p>The thought crossed Chu Yuan’s mind and he couldn’t contain it anymore. A burning passion filled his eyes as he looked at Tang Xiu and said, “Mr. Tang, what price do I have to pay in order to become a cultivator? Is money… okay?”</p><p>Tang Xiu shot him a strange look and immediately produced a wry smile in reply, “Money is a good thing, especially in this age of materialism. Only, do I look like I’m short on money to you?”</p><p>Chu Yuan’s breath stagnated and he immediately let out a bitter smile, “With your identity and ability, you’re indeed not short on money, Mr. Tang.”</p><p>What did this Big Daddy lack?</p><p>Tang Xiu couldn’t help but roll his eyes at the idea. He did not expect that Chu Yuan could be this astute and yet still not stepped on the Dao. He only said those words to counterpoise and did not expect him to follow up. However, he was still reluctant to sell an ancient cultivation technique, nevertheless. After all, the world’s spiritual qi was thin nowadays, while cultivation resources were also scarce. The more cultivators, the more the competition for resources.</p><p>He could tell that Chu Yuan was a very ambitious man. Although he was not afraid of him, what he avoided was troublesome matters and thus did not want to spread out cultivation techniques. After pondering about it, he decided to not trade a cultivation technique with him for the time being.</p><p>As for money! As long as he worked hard to obtain it, he would be able to acquire a colossal amount of funds in a few years. As of now, he would not sow a seed of trouble just for some petty profit.</p><p>Tang Xiu waved his hand and smilingly said, “You too know that I’m not short on money, so let’s forget about the transaction. I may be interested in teaching you a cultivation technique a few years later. But not now!”</p><p>Disappointment could be seen on Chu Yuan’s eyes, and he could not resign himself to it. After a moment of contemplation, he secretly made up his mind to obtain a cultivation technique by whatever means necessary, so as to cultivate and become an expert earlier. After all, Tang Xiu was not the only person possessing a cultivation technique. He believed that he could obtain it as long as he had money.”</p><p>Knock knock…</p><p>The door was knocked and a middle-aged man entered the room.</p><p>“Boss, Miss Ouyang is here.”</p><p>Tang Xiu was stunned for a second, before he nodded and said, “Tell her to wait outside for a while. I’ll come out shortly.”</p><p>A few minutes later, Tang Xiu came into the living room with Chu Yuan. He saw Ouyang Lulu with her legs curled up and her mouth seemed to be chewing… a lollipop. With a smiling face, he then said, “You caught the news pretty fast, Lulu! How do you know I returned to Shanghai?”</p><p>Ouyang Lulu jumped up from the sofa and glanced at Chu Yuan behind Tang Xiu. She immediately stretched her hands to hug Tang Xiu and smiled affectionately, “You know that this Miss has a boundless supernatural power, don’t you? I just pointed a finger to calculate and knew that you were coming back. I haven’t seen you during the winter vacation. Did you miss me all this while? I’ll smack you if you dare say you did not.”</p><p>Tang Xiu patted her back while smelling her fragrance and smilingly said, “I did miss you, okay?”</p><p>With a satisfied expression, Ouyang Lulu released Tang Xiu and her chin then tilted toward Chu Yuan, asking, “Your friend?”</p><p>“Yeah!” Tang Xiu replied with a smile.</p><p>Extending her hand towards Chu Yuan, Ouyang Lulu then spoke, “Hello, I’m Ouyang Lulu, the owner of the Paradise Manor, and also Tang Xiu’s wife.”</p><p>“The Imperial Garden’s Chu Yuan.”</p><p>The Ouyang Lulu’s striking beauty made Chu Yuan stunned, especially her last sentence. At this moment, he finally understood why Xue Yu could not enter Tang Xiu’s eyes. Ouyang Lulu’s appearance before him, either her figure or her makings, though they were not superior to Xue Yu’s, they were also a type of perfectness.</p><p>Squeezing out a smile, Chu Yuan spoke to Tang Xiu, “Mr. Tang, there’s something I need to tend to, so I’ll take my leave first. Feel free to visit the Imperial Garden at any time if you have some spare time.”</p><p>Tang Xiu said in a strange tone, “Don’t you want to see me open your gift?”</p><p>Chu Yuan coughed once and said, “There’s a guest visiting you here… Miss Ouyang, so I won’t stay. Besides, I already gave you that small gift, Mr. Tang. You can appreciate it later.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
