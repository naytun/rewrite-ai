She did her best to serve him that night, and not only did she win this young man’s favor, she also obtained tens of thousands of yuan. Following that, she was also often called to serve him from time to time.</p><p>However, she knew she had just created trouble looking at the angry Yue Kai. Though Yue Kai was only a freshman at Shanghai University, he probably came from a notable, wealthy family given his extravagant spending.</p><p>Yue Kai’s angry eyes instantly landed on Wu Guanghui and roared, “LET THE GIRL GO, YOU FUCKTARD!”</p><p>Wu Guanghui raised his brows. Not only did he not release Xie Xiaotong, but also lowered his face to kiss her, shot Yue Kai a provocative look, and then casually said, “Who the hell is this rubbish? Xiaotong, honey! Where the hell did this bloke came from? Do you know him?”</p><p>Xie Xiaotong knew how Wu Guanghui acted to a certain degree, and in particular, his habit to seek revenge for the smallest grievance, and his pettiness was also notoriously famous in his social circle. She would end up miserable if she made him lose face today. After hesitating and weighing the importance of Yue Kai and Wu Guanghui inside her mind, the balance counter immediately fell to the latter. She raised her pretty face, shook her head and said, “I don’t know him, Young Master Wu.”</p><p>Wu Guanghui nodded in satisfaction, hoisted his face toward Yue Kai a few times and sneered, “Did you hear that, punk? My honey, Xiaotong, doesn’t know you. You’re just hopelessly picking up a fight, aren’t you?”</p><p>Yue Kai stared at Xie Xiaotong in disbelief. He had planned to beat the guy, but Xie Xiaotong’s answer was like a heavy slap in the face, literally trashing his complexion and burning his face.</p><p>She doesn’t know him?</p><p>The woman who slept with him a few days ago now said that she doesn’t know him just to fawn upon another man?</p><p>Yue Kai took a deep breath, trying to contain his anger inside. He pointed at Wu Guanghui and shot a “you got guts” look, and then turned around and walk away. Just as he was about to step out of the store door, he suddenly remembered something and walked back to the checkout counter, grabbed the 30 thousand yuan, and then spoke to the elegant and beautiful cashier in a deep voice, “I, Yue Kai, am a rich guy, but I’m not giving my money to that bitch. You, on the other hand, are much better since you make a living by your own skills. I’m leaving this money for you to pick wherever bag you like. Just count it as a present.”</p><p>With that said, he went straight to the entrance door without looking back.</p><p>The elegant and beautiful cashier was utterly dumbfounded as she held the 30 thousand yuan Yue Kai gave her. She looked at Xie Xiaotong and then looked at Yue Kai’s back with a sympathetic expression. However, she then turned around to speak to her female colleague in a whisper and then chased toward the outside.</p><p>At the shop’s entrance.</p><p>Tang Xiu heard Yue Kai’s yell, but he did not go inside. Though he did not know what happened inside, he did not want to meddle in the love affair issues between Yue Kai and his girlfriend.</p><p>“Are you okay?” Asked Tang Xiu casually after seeing Yue Kai come out with a sullen face.</p><p>Yue Kai spat to the side, shook his head and said with a scowl, “It’s nothing. I just had some fun with a bitch for a couple of days, and now I wanna go home to wash my body since I’m done with her.”</p><p>Tang Xiu sighed inwardly as he nodded and said, “Since you’re fine, let us just leave.”</p><p>The female cashier appeared in front of him holding the 30 thousand yuan quickly blocked Yue Kai’s path and said, “Hello, Sir. This is your money, I can’t accept it.”</p><p>“Interesting. This fucking bastard is really interesting. You know, a nobody is still a nobody, for no one will accept money from a fucktard like you.” Wu Guanghui came out from the inside while hugging the two women’s shoulders. He had heard Yue Kai cursing Xie Xiaotong as a bitch and was very angry inwardly. He came out and planned to humiliate Yue Kai, but did not expect to be a godsend opportunity just as he came out.</p><p>In an instant, Yue Kai’s face turned extremely nasty.</p><p>The female cashier had watched all the unfolded causes and everything that followed. She knew that this young master Wu was not a good man. She knew that this guy was using her to mock Yue Kai, making her sympathize with the latter, and quickly said, “That’s not true, since there’s a regulation in our store that no employees are allowed to receive tips and any benefits from our customers.”</p><p>Wu Guanghui frowned, and there was an annoyed look in his eyes, as he shouted at her in a deep voice, “SHUT THE HELL UP!”</p><p>Tang Xiu, who stood by at the side and looked at the fearful looking female cashier, as well as the nasty looking Yue Kai, secretly sighed inwardly and spoke to Wu Guanghui, “Dude, go easy on them. You already have the upper hand, so stop it here and now! It’s not worth it for you to make enemies just because of women, especially for such casual women.”</p><p>Wu Guanghui let out a complacent smile and only glanced at Tang Xiu. His eyes then fell again on Yue Kai’s unsightly expression. On the contrary, it was Xie Xiaotong who was fuming, unable to bear being the target of Tang Xiu’s ugly remark, as she cussed angrily, “Who the hell are you? It’s none of your damn business! What are you, to mind others’ fucking business? Careful with your words, who the hell did you say was a casual woman, huh? What a dickhead!”</p><p>The other woman also swayed her voluptuous waist and indignantly said, “Did you wash your mouth with shit? Look at your destitute and sour appearance, yet you want to be the third wheel in other’s business? Hmph… relying on yourself you want to trifle with me?”</p><p>Wu Guanghui looked overjoyed and kissed Xie Xiaotong and the other woman’s face and unreservedly praised them, “My two babies, you really can talk, eh? Anyways, your Young Master’s mood is very great today, so good that I will treat and love you well tonight!”</p><p>Tang Xiu watched the trio in disgust, and then looked at the female cashier and lightly said, “My brother gave the money to you. Just accept it. You’re outside the store now, so the rules of your employer no longer apply to you.”</p><p>With that said, he patted Yue Kai’s shoulder, shook his head and said, “Let’s just go! Do you want to bite back the mad dogs who just bit you? Just go back home, take a bath and wash your bad luck.”</p><p>Yue Kai nodded. He did not get angry with that female cashier though she had to give back his money and it was used by Wu Guanghui to mock him. He, on the contrary, admired her, because that 30 thousand yuan was probably equal to one or two months of her salary.</p><p>“Yeah, right!” Wu Guanghui rolled his eyes and looked at Tang Xiu and Yue Kai with disdain. He was regretting wasting time to taunt these two trashes, so he might as well spend his time having fun with these two women.</p><p>At this moment, his totally unconcerned eyes drifted from Tang Xiu and Yue Kai and were about to turn back to the store, as his eyes caught sight of someone and his expression moved all of a sudden. He immediately released the two women and strode past Tang Xiu towards a pair of handsome man and woman who were passing by another place about a dozen meters away from them.</p><p>“Hello, Brother Chu.”</p><p>The man and the woman halted their pace. When the man saw Wu Guanghui rushing over, a disgusted look flashed in his eyes, but he nodded at him and said, “It’s you, Little Wu! Did your Dad send you out of the company?”</p><p>“Yeah, I did great recently in the company, Brother Chu, so Dad gave me a holiday. I never thought I would bump into you here today. It’s really… a pleasure and honor for me. Anyways, is this… big sis-in-law? Wow, she’s really a fairy. A goddess.”</p><p>Wu Guanghui looked at the woman next to Chu Yuan, feeling very envious inside, though he still kept flattering without a change in expression or his voice.</p><p>Chu Yuan only let out a faint smile and did not feel like explaining his relationship with Xue Yu. He did take the initiative to invite Xue Yu out for a walk today. Since Xue Yu herself just came to Shanghai and had already bought her enough daily necessities and clothes with Tang Xiu before, she still proposed to visit the venue and was planning to buy some clothes, accessories, and jewelry for herself. It was because she wanted to dress herself up to look beautiful in order to attract Tang Xiu.</p><p>Suddenly, Chu Yuan’s expression moved, because he caught sight of two men in front, and one of them was unexpectedly Tang Xiu. He subconsciously glanced at Xue Yu and found that she also saw Tang Xiu and straightly walked towards him.</p><p>“How come you are here?” Tang Xiu felt somewhat helpless inside upon seeing Xue Yu and Chu Yuan. However, he felt quite amused and annoyed to see Wu Guanghui, who previously acted so rampant and arrogant, now rushed over to Chu Yuan’s front to greet him with such a humble manner.</p><p>Xue Yu let out a faint smile and grabbed Tang Xiu’s arm, saying, “Chu Yuan called me out to take a walk today. It’s kinda boring to go to the teahouse, so I brought him here since I wanted to buy some clothes and jewelry.”</p><p>Tang Xiu nodded at her. He then looked at Chu Yuan and said, “How was it? Were you able to persuade her?”</p><p>“Haven’t you seen what her character is like?” Chu Yuan shook his head. “She’ll never budge on what she has decided upon. Not even ten bulls can pull her. Anyways, it’s you who is too excessive, Tang Xiu. You just left her as your lover only.”</p><p>“It was me who was willing!” Xue Yu interjected with an irritated expression.</p><p>Tang Xiu could not help laughing. He shifted his sight to Yue Kai, who was gaping in astonishment, and then Wu Guanghui, who was utterly dumbfounded and tongue-tied. While pointing at the latter, he asked, “Do you know this brat?”</p><p>“Yeah, I know his father.” Chu Yuan nodded. “I have had some business deals with him.”</p><p>“This brat is kind of a rotten apple—the type of unbridled and arrogant young master,” said Tang Xiu. “You had better lessen your contact with him and his father later, since he is probably as bad as him for teaching such a son. If you can opt not to cooperate with him later, then try not to so as to save your own money.”</p><p>“Did this brat provoke you or something?” Asked Chu Yuan, surprised.</p><p>“It’s nothing.” Tang Xiu waved his hand. “It’s just a trivial thing, there’s no need to stoop down to his level. Anyhow, let me introduce you to this guy. He’s Yue Kai, a brother and a fellow student of mine in university. Yue Kai, this is Chu Yuan, it’s fine for you to call him Brother Chu later.”</p><p>“Hello, Brother Chu. I’ve already heard your great name before. You’re simply a legend in the business circle in Shanghai, an awesome figure in the domestic financial industry.” Yue Kai hurriedly stretched his hand out to shake hands. “Anyways, I did not expect you to be friends with Big Bro Tang, though.”</p><p>Chu Yuan’s acted very humble, and after he shook hands with Yue Kai, he said with a smile, “Please don’t tease me and compare me with Boss Tang, Brother Yue. I don’t even qualify to carry his shoes.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
