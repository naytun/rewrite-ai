In just a dozen seconds, he appeared in the middle of the battle where both sides had mutually suffered heavy losses.</p><p>“WHO IS IT?”</p><p>“HOW IS HE HERE?”</p><p>Jin Sanchi and Jin Sijie converged together and instantly retreated back to the crowd of Strange Door’s people.  They looked panicked and full of horror as they set their vision at Tang Xiu’s figure intently, while Western Nefarious Sangha was trembling and Golden Armored Zombie who had yet get up from the ground wore a disbelieving expression.</p><p>Crack…</p><p>With a loud slap of his palms, Tang Xiu pulled Western Nefarious Sangha dozens of meters high to the air and stretched his hand out to catch the jet-black spear. He coldly hummed and said, “Hmph, this really is depicting the old adage that humans will die for riches like bids will for food. Nefarious Sangha, you do have some good means and good plots indeed!”</p><p>Western Nefarious Sangha wailed in anguish inside. Never did he dream that Tang Xiu would come back here. He knew that he was finished. Tang Xiu probably would not spare him for concealing the matter about the Immortal Trove, and that he had already seen through whatever schemes he had in mind. However, he did not want to die because Tang Xiu had imparted the cultivation technique he had yet to try, and he wanted to become a Nascent Soul Stage powerhouse in the future as well.</p><p>Therefore, under the watchful of everyone present, he suppressed his fatal injury and threw himself at Tang Xi’s front, kneeling and bitterly weeping, “Boss, please forgive me. I’m willing to help you open the entrance to the Immortal Trove left by Daoist Tu Yang and help you obtain everything inside it.”</p><p>At this moment, Golden Armored Zombie had finally gotten up. A chill filled his heart after seeing Tang Xiu and hastily called out, “You came, Immortal Master! You won’t have any problems cleaning up these people. I’m severely injured now and I’ll take my leave.”</p><p>With that said, he then tried to leave.</p><p>Tang Xiu sneered and threw the black spear in his hand. In a thousandth of a second, it pierced Golden Armored Zombie’s head and directly slayed him. He had spared this Golden Armored Zombie’s life previously and thought that this old zombie would be of a little use, and even gave him a suitable cultivation technique to practice as he wanted to foster an expert out of him.</p><p>But now, he utterly detested this Golden Armored Zombie who appealed mercy for Western Nefarious Sangha! What he abhorred was his small calculation to scheme him.</p><p>Turning his head to look at the frightened Western Nefarious Sangha, Tang Xiu sneered, “I gave you a chance already. Pity that your ambition is way too high and you missed this opportunity in vain. So, you must die as well.”</p><p>With a flick of his thought, Western Nefarious Sangha’s heart directly exploded, and even his body exploded into a cloud of blood and completely disappeared from the world. After having vented the anger inside and taking back the black spear, Tang Xiu shifted his gaze to the large crowd in the forest, toward Jin Sanchi and Jin Shijie and the dozens of people of the Strange Door who were still alive.</p><p>“Are you people not going to introduce yourselves?”</p><p>Tang Xiu did not intend to kill these people. After all, their goal was the Immortal Trove and the people they attacked were Western Nefarious Sangha and Golden Armored Zombie. However, you’d better think about the owner when you want to beat the dog. He did not mind exterminating these people as well if they did not act like losers and paid nothing.</p><p>While trying his best to suppress the poison inside his body, Jin Sanchi watched in vigilance when Tang Xiu killed Golden Armored Zombie and Western Nefarious Sangha. After a moment of silence, he asked in a deep voice, “Who are you?”</p><p>“The Boss of Golden Armored Zombie,” answered Tang Xiu.</p><p>“You know clearly well what I’m asking about that,” said Jin Sanchi.</p><p>“You’re not worthy enough to know my identity,” said Tang Xiu with indifference. “What I want from you is how you will make up for this. You, after all, besieged my people, and that made me unhappy!”</p><p>While covering his chest, Jin Sijie stepped forward and said, “Since you want us to explain it, I’m willing to use my life to work for you to pay off this debt. But I hope Your Excellency can give mercy to my Third Brother and the rest and spare their lives.”</p><p>“Your life isn’t worth anything in my eyes. Besides, your life is about to end.” Tang Xiu sneered. “Do you find it interesting to fool me?”</p><p>“Then what do you want?” Asked Jin Sijie with a white and bloodless complexion.</p><p>“Hand over that Sky Piercer Halberd and that golden bell. That simple,” said Tang Xiu lightly.</p><p>Jin Sijie threw the Sky Piercer Halberd to Tang Xiu and then turned to look at the dozen people of the Strange Doors and shouted, “Give it to him.”</p><p>They did not even hesitate to do what he ordered. They could feel how powerful Tang Xiu was and simply did not dare to offend him at the moment. Provoke Tang Xiu’s anger and the chance of them surviving this predicament would be close to negligible. After handing over the golden bell to Tang Xiu, they immediately returned to their original positions.</p><p>Jin Sijie coughed up two mouthfuls of blood and said, “We will not dare to set our eyes on the Immortal Trove again, Your Excellency, so we can’t be considered as enemies. Can we take our leave now?”</p><p>“The matter here has indeed been solved, but there are still some private matters that need to be addressed. Of all you people from the Strange Doors, who among you are from the Serenity Sect and Jin Family?” Asked Tang Xiu lightly.</p><p>“I’m the Sect Master of Serenity Sect, Xuan You. Six of our experts came out this time, but the other five have died,” said a sturdy middle-aged who stepped out from the crowd and cupped his fists.</p><p>“I’m a member of Jin Family,” said the middle-aged woman, who had sneak attacked and killed Shipo, took two steps forward. She was seriously injured at this moment due to Western Nefarious Sangha’s attack previously, and her chances of surviving were slim had she not treated her injuries timely.</p><p>With an indifferent expression, Tang Xiu nodded and said, “Two of you, you had better commit suicide immediately if you don’t want to suffer the fate of wanting to live and die and yet you can’t have both. Furthermore, I don’t think there is any need for either the Serenity Sect and Jin Family to exist anymore. You don’t have to fear being lonely on the road to the Underworld after you die!”</p><p>With a great change in expression, Xuan You hurriedly shouted, “BUT WHY? Has our Serenity Sect ever offended you, Your Excellency?”</p><p>Elegant Chess Saintess hastily cupped her fists and said, “This… Immortal Master, where and how my Jin Family has inadvertently offended you? Please tell me directly.”</p><p>“Hmph, I’ll explain it to you since you two want to die.” Tang Xiu snorted coldly. “Xuan Yugu, from the Serenity Sect, and Wang Hu, a disciple of Elegant Chess Saintess, signed the Life and Death Pact with me in the hunting grounds since they wanted to kill me quickly. I have killed both of them now. That’s right, that Justice Hall’s Master of the Serenity Sect was also killed by my subordinate. Do you think I will spare your lives since I’ve killed your people and give you a chance for revenge?”</p><p>“WHAT DID YOU SAY?” Xuan You’s pupils constricted and he staggeringly took two steps back, almost sitting on the ground. Xuan Yugu was his only child, part of his soul, and his treasure. And yet, he was actually killed by this bastard?</p><p>Elegant Chess Saintess looked so grieved and wretched while intense regret grew inside her. The reason why she took Wang Hu as a disciple was because his family could help her a bit. Furthermore, Wang Hu also had a good constitution and was suitable to inherit her mantle. But she never expected that that damn bastard would turn out to court such a huge trouble for her and the Jin Family.</p><p>“I’LL KILL YOU!”</p><p>Xuan You suddenly flashed towards Tang Xiu while Elegant Chess Saintess was filled with regrets. He pulled the two-handed saber from his waist and brandished it towards Tang Xiu.</p><p>“DON’T!” Jin Sanchi and Jin Sijie exclaimed at the same time.</p><p>However, a cold glint flashed in Tang Xiu’s eyes as he pierced the long black spear in his hand towards the man’s chest and instantly killed him. After which, Tang Xiu looked at Jin Sanchi and Jin Shijie, as he said, “I don’t feel like killing these people from the Serenity Sect. You two will kill them.”</p><p>With that said, he flicked his finger and shot a Holy Healing medicine towards Jin Sijie.</p><p>Jin Sijie looked stunned as he glanced at the Holy Healing medicine in his hand. After smelling it, he then immediately exclaimed, “This medicine is…”</p><p>“Take it. It can preserve your life,” said Tang Xiu indifferently.</p><p>With an ecstatic expression, Jin Sijie replied without hesitation, “Thank you, Daoist. I’ll exterminate the Serenity Sect’s people on your behalf.”</p><p>Tang Xiu nodded at him and then looked at Elegant Chess Saintess.</p><p>At the moment, Elegant Chess Saintess’s face was constantly changing. Under Tang Xiu’s gaze, she braced herself forward and bitterly said, “Immortal Master, I don’t know how that scoundrel disciple of mine offended you. Since he already died in your hands, it’s a death he deserved for his punishment. But I hope you can work around my Jin Family this once, Immortal Master. My family is willing to compensate you.”</p><p>“What compensation can your Jin Family give me, huh?” Tang Xiu sneered. “You must know, only a few things can enter my eyes.”</p><p>Elegant Chess Saintess was silent for a while, before she suddenly stepped forward and took out a red-colored Water Caltrop from her waist and handed it over to Tang Xiu, “This is a magic weapon I accidentally obtained from a certain place in the Miao Region. But I’m not a cultivator and have no means to use it. I’m now offering it to you, Immortal Master. I hope you can see my sincerity and spare us this time.”</p><p>A magic weapon?</p><p>Tang Xiu took the red Water Caltrop and was immediately surprised since it was indeed a magic treasure, a magic weapon especially tailored to women. He really could not figure out something. When did so many magic weapons exist on Earth?</p><p>Half a minute after, he looked at Elegant Chess Saintess again and indifferently said, “You’re not bad. I saw you act to kill Shipo and saved me some energy to act, so I’ll spare you this time. Jin Sanchi, Jin Sijie, since the two of you dare to lead a lot of people to come here, I’m sure you have a way to open the entrance to this Immortal Trove, isn’t that right?”</p><p>Jin Sanchi and Jin Sijie exchanged looks, as the brothers then shook their heads in answer. Jin Sanchi then said with a helpless expression, “Fellow Daoist, we have yet to grasp any means for it. We dragged in a lot of people this time chiefly to exterminate Western Nefarious Sangha, Golden Armored Zombie, and Shipo to seize this place. Only then would we try to slowly conduct a research to find a way to break through this Immortal Abode and get the Immortal Trove.”</p><p>“Then leave now if you don’t know anything!” Tang Xiu said. “But do remember! This place is not for you to come in the future. I hope you stop being avaricious and give away your life in vain.”</p><p>“Understood!”</p><p>Jin Sanchi and Jin Sijie were helpless and yet they had no choice but to comply. There were all injured now, and their remaining strength at this moment was only at 50%. They would probably lose their lives if they fought with Tang Xiu.</p><p>Immediately after, more than a dozen people left quickly, leaving only Tang Xiu and several dead bodies there. After storing the golden bell and red Water Caltrop, Mo Awu and the others caught up fast. Tang Xiu ordered them to deal with the dead bodies and then took the black spear and entered the cave where Western Nefarious Sangha planted medicinal herbs.</p><p>It was an Immortal Trove! He did not know what treasure it stored inside, but since it could drive Western Nefarious Sangha and the Jin Brothers to lose all decorum and have a fallout, then it could only mean that the treasures it held were outstanding.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
