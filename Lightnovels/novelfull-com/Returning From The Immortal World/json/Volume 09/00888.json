The desserts and fruits after dinner made the duo move their fingers to feed their mouth while rubbing their bellies while lamenting as for how they had been so poor and powerless.</p><p>“Young Lady and Sir, please feel free to say if you have other requests. Our Boss has told us that. Also, please receive these two VIP membership cards as well. The VIP rooms for you two have been prepared and this is the room card. You can rest there at any time.” The tall and gorgeous Paradise Club’s staffer said with a chuckle.</p><p>“Your Boss?” asked Yang Pengchao curiously. “You mean, the owner of this Paradise Manor?”</p><p>“That’s right, our Boss,” answered the female staffer.</p><p>“But… we didn’t even know who your Boss was,” said Yang Pengchao with a puzzled expression. “Why did he give us VIP membership cards? Is it because of the arrangement of Mr. Tang?”</p><p>“Is this Mr. Tang you said named Tang Xiu?” asked the female staffer.</p><p>“Yeah!” Yang Pengchao nodded.</p><p>“Our Boss is surnamed Ouyang and she’s Mr. Tang’s girlfriend, so the staffers here also call him Boss. The reception for you two is what he has arranged for you.”</p><p>Yang Pengchao was inwardly startled. He never imagined that such a luxurious and upscale Paradise Manor was actually established by Tang Xiu’s girlfriend. Was this also his industry?</p><p>“Mr. Tang is truly great,” sighed Yue Li heartfeltly. “He can be said to have the wealth of an entire nation.”</p><p>“Yeah, I think the Forbes ranking list that is evaluated publicly and always announced annually is incorrect.” Yang Pengchao nodded in agreement and said, “Mr. Tang is definitely at the top of the list.”</p><p>“Well, our Boss doesn’t like to be in the limelight, though,” said the female staffer with a smile.</p><p>Ding, ding…</p><p>During their conversation, Yang Pengchao’s handset ringtone sounded. When he took his phone out and opened the text he just received, he was dumbfounded all of a sudden.</p><p>“1, 2, 3… 9.”</p><p>“1, 2, 3…”</p><p>“1…, ….”</p><p>Counting repeatedly three times, Yang Pengchao muttered with a dull face, “Nine digits? 690 million?”</p><p>“What?” Yue Li looked at him in confusion and asked.</p><p>Yang Pengchao’s face turned red and his body slightly shivered as he replied with trembling lips, “Yue… Yue Li, just pinch me. I think I’m dreaming.”</p><p>“What exactly is it?” Yue Li asked with a strange expression. “You just looked at your phone and become like this?”</p><p>Yang Pengchao’s tone turned higher and he hurriedly replied, “690 million, more than 690 million! Tang Xiu… Mr. Tang truly keeps his words… he really ordered someone to transfer 100 million US dollars into my account. It’s more than 690 million if it’s converted to Chinese yuan. What a good person! He’s really a good, great man!”</p><p>Yue Li rushed to his side and read the text several times before sighing with overjoy, “A gentleman’s words are truly precious and weighed like a mountain. Mr. Tang is truly honest and sincere. Pengchao, you must work well for him in the future. I firmly believe he can give you a brilliant future.”</p><p>Yang Pengchao firmly nodded and replied with all seriousness, “I will. Definitely.”</p><p>At the entrance to Paradise Manor.</p><p>Mo Xiaohan was dressed beautifully in a way that showed her youthfulness as she carried her bag and headed to the entrance. Her eyes, however, were constantly focusing at Jin Shi who was in front of her with a pounding heart.</p><p>This man… truly had a macho style!</p><p>This guy was not handsome but was definitely cool. She had long passed the age of being a shy teenage girl and had seen so many handsome guys. But she found that those handsome men she saw before were worse than this security guard in front of her now.</p><p>‘If this lady’s jade chicken is genuine and gets me 100 million US dollars, I’ll be sure to nail this Cool Uncle and make him do nothing in the future. I’ll just watch this cool guy do the laundry, cook and wait upon me.’</p><p>Her thoughts fleeted in fantasy for a while as she unwittingly followed Jin Shi into a spacious, hundreds of square meters wide VIP room. Despite having visited upscale venues, she was still shocked by its interior decoration.</p><p>“Hey, Cool Uncle, what’s your name?”</p><p>“My name has nothing to do with you, right? You should just wait here. I’ve already informed my Boss; he’ll come here to see you soon,” replied Jin Shi indifferently.</p><p>After that, he turned and headed to the VIP room’s door.</p><p>Mo Xiaohan raised her hand, but no words came out of her mouth. Right as Jin Shi was about to disappear from the room’s door, only then did she have the courage to say aloud, “Hey, Cool Uncle! When you are tired with your security job, after I get 100 million US dollars, I’ll support you in the future!”</p><p>“…”</p><p>Jin Shi, who just stepped out of the door, staggered and almost fell. He was at a loss whether he had to laugh or cry before he stared at Mo Xiaohan and left quickly.</p><p>A few minutes later, Tang Xiu came to the VIP room and looked at the pretty young lady, Mo Xiaohan. Then he smiled and said, “Hello, I’m Tang Xiu, the person who is looking for the zodiac jade carvings. May I know how I should address you, Miss?”</p><p>“My surname is Mo,” said Mo Xiaohan. “Anyways, it’s kinda strange, though. Why do you look familiar? Also, your name is… Tang Xiu? It seems like the name of a very kind divine doctor…”</p><p>Her voice abruptly stopped and Mo Xiaohan’s bright pupils instantly turned into saucers as she was shocked. She exclaimed, “I remember you. You’re the Young Divine Doctor, Tang Xiu!”</p><p>“Yeah, it’s me,” said Tang Xiu smilingly.</p><p>“Well, is it necessary for you to spend 100 million US dollars just to buy zodiac jade carvings? Oh, God! How are you so rich? That’s not right, though. You don’t just spend 100 million US dollars since you still need ten zodiac jade carvings, no? Then… aren’t you going to spend a billion US dollars?”</p><p>“Oh, please don’t entertain all sorts of ideas,” said Tang Xiu with a smile. “Anyways, let’s discuss the deal since we’ve introduced ourselves! You said you have the jade rooster; where is it?”</p><p>Mo Xiaohan gulped and asked in an anxious and doubtful tone, “Would you really give 100 million dollars if I have the jade rooster?”</p><p>“I will,” said Tang Xiu firmly.</p><p>Mo Xiaohan joyfully nodded and took out the red jade rooster from the bag she carried. She handed it to Tang Xiu and said, “This is it.”</p><p>After receiving and appraising it, Tang Xiu suppressed his joy inwardly and noddingly said, “Yes, this one is the jade rooster from the whole set of zodiac jade carvings. Miss Mo, this jade rooster belongs to me from now on. Tell me your bank account and I’ll assign someone to transfer your money.”</p><p>“Great!” Mo Xiaohan suppressed her excitement and nodded before she told Tang Xiu her bank account.</p><p>At this moment, Jin Shi, who had just left, returned and quickly came to Tang Xiu and reported, “There’s another guest who claims to have a zodiac jade carving. Our men are bringing him here.”</p><p>Tang Xiu’s eyes lit up and replied quickly, “Did he say he brought the zodiac jade carving with him?”</p><p>“I asked him that. He said it’s a jade rabbit,” said Jin Shi.</p><p>Tang Xiu nodded happily and turned to look at Mo Xiaohan, “Miss Mo, you must have rushed from another region to Shanghai, right? If you’d like to, you can have a rest in Paradise Manor. You’re exempted from any expense during your stay here.”</p><p>“Divine Doctor Tang, can you let me have a look at that jade rabbit?” asked Mo Xiaohan quickly.</p><p>Tang Xiu hesitated for a moment before he nodded and gave her permission, “You can see it, but you must tell the other party that you’re also the person who brought the jade rooster. After all, supposing that you don’t want to disclose your identity, we want it to keep it secret for your sake.”</p><p>“Got no problem with that.” Mo Xiaohan nodded quickly and said, “I agree.”</p><p>Immediately after, Zhang Moyuan hurriedly arrived with the escort of the security guard. He recognized Tang Xiu’s identity the moment he saw him, and, with a bit of an anxious yet excited look, he greeted Tang Xiu.</p><p>Tang Xiu smiled at him and said, “Mr. Zhang, this is the previous owner of the jade rooster. If you don’t mind, could you please take out the jade rabbit now?”</p><p>Zhang Moyuan nodded to Mo Xiaohan and immediately took the jade rabbit out and handed it to Tang Xiu. After Tang Xiu appraised it, the object was also a genuine piece of the twelve zodiac jade carvings.</p><p>“Mr. Tang, is it exactly what you need?”</p><p>“Indeed.” Tang Xiu nodded.</p><p>Zhang Moyuan excitedly asked, “Then when are you going to…”</p><p>As Tang Xiu saw his hesitant look to speak his mind out, he smiled and said, “I understand what you mean. Give me your bank account and I’ll immediately transfer the money to you. I’ve already negotiated with the bank about this transaction, so the money will be in your account up to two hours after we transfer it.”</p><p>“Good. Great!” replied Zhang Moyuan joyfully.</p><p>“You can rest assured about the confidentiality issues,” said Tang Xiu with a smile. “Also, the two of you have come from afar, so you can rest at our Paradise Manor. All expenses are free of charge.”</p><p>Zhang Moyuan looked reluctant and replied, “Mr. Tang, is it alright if I say that I don’t need you to keep it confidential?”</p><p>“You don’t want to keep it a secret?” Tang Xiu was surprised. “Of course, we can even hold a press conference to announce your real situation to the public if you’d like to.”</p><p>“Then I’m grateful for that,” said Zhang Moyuan seriously. “I want everyone in the whole country to know that I was the previous owner of the jade rabbit and sold it for 100 million US dollars.”</p><p>“No problem.” Tang Xiu readily consented and smilingly asked, “Mr. Zhang, few people want to deliberately publicize after they obtain some riches, though. Care to tell me how are you different from others?”</p><p>“To tell you honestly, I mainly want those who have refused, despised and even jeered at me to see it.” Zhang Moyuan said with a bitter face. “I want to tell them that Zhang Moyuan is not driven into a corner and desperate. Before I came here, my company’s business had been in trouble and the capital chains are kind of in a tight spot with serious problems. I originally borrowed some funds from many friends that I thought were good comrades. Yet, everyone seemed to avoid me as though I was a plague or something. Too many words they uttered that were kinda unpleasant to hear…”</p><p>After a while, Tang Xiu finally figured out his motive and was secretly glad inside. It was kind of fortunate for him that Zhang Moyuan’s company was in such a situation and that his friends didn’t lend him money, otherwise, would he even come to Shanghai to sell his jade rabbit to him? It was unlikely.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
