His unruly and unyielding display generated loud applause from the prisoners around him. It was obvious that they wanted to watch a good show.</p><p>The grim-looking Getae sneered, “Granted that you’ve saved us, you want us to pledge loyalty to you so you can humiliate us, isn’t that right?”</p><p>“Humiliate you? Do you think you have the competence to be humiliated?” derided Tang Xiu. “Don’t forget, I have your life in my hands; a mere thought of mine can make your soul scatter, forever prohibited from reincarnating.”</p><p>“I admit you’re very powerful; that you can make Spectre submit to you is a feat that I admire,” replied Getae with a heavy voice. “In my eyes, the world is where the strong prey on the weak, so we’re willing to work under you since you’re stronger and even rescued us from prison. But spare your damn arrogance for we only promise to follow and work for you. But never will you imprison us to another cage!”</p><p>“Hmph…” Tang Xiu snorted as a Mitsubishi army knife twirled and pierced Getae’s heart instantly. Even after he pulled out the knife from Getae’s back, he turned it around to Getae’s neck and neatly cut it, causing his head to fall down.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>Except for Spectre and the Ammos and Ammosai Brothers, the other 200 prisoners had a drastic change in expression. The smile on their faces froze and their bodies turned rigid while filled disbelief in their eyes. They were also vicious and ruthless but still far away from Tang Xiu, who directly killed an expert merely out of discontentment, a show that shocked and shook their souls.</p><p>Tang Xiu shifted his eyes to Yale Sass and apathetically said, “Which one will you choose if you must pick: death or absolute obedience?”</p><p>Yale Sass’s anger had disappeared in a flash. Tang Xiu’s dreadfulness had already shocked him, but he was now more horrified after seeing his ruthlessness. Under the watchful eyes of so many people, however, he couldn’t just accept his face being trampled on.</p><p>“I can obey your orders but you still have to respect us. Besides, I don’t think you will kill all of us here since you’ve done everything possible to save us.”</p><p>Tang Xiu shook his head while smiling. He formed a seal with his hands as a huge flame appeared around Yale Sass instantly. It was like invisible gasoline was poured around Yale Sass as the fire blazed and set the guy alight outrageously.</p><p>“Aaaargh…”</p><p>A tragic scream came from Yale Sass’s mouth. He majorly struggled, moving up and down, falling to the floor, rolling back and forth and more, yet the flame burned stronger.</p><p>Tang Xiu took out the cigarette and lit it up with the flame from his finger, then took a deep puff twice. Then he sneered, “You wanna talk respect with me? What absolute ludicrosity! You should have been tortured to death in that labor camp 1319 and met your death a long time ago. I’m the one who gave you the second life, so obey my orders! You know what? You’re nothing but an ant in my eyes; do you think an ant deserves to be respected?”</p><p>The billowing voice rippled around and instantly spread out to everyone’s ears.</p><p>In that instant, all the observing prisoners were shocked by the horrifying ruthlessness shown by Tang Xiu. Their anger was also ignited after hearing Tang Xiu’s humiliating remarks. Yet, none dared to speak despite their indignance as they instead watched Yale Sass being burnt to ashes by the blazing flame.</p><p>“BAM…”</p><p>The door to the gambling hall was pushed open and everyone looked to the disruption in a flash.</p><p>It was Shui Gui, now dragging the drenched Gillon Touma. As he came to the front of Tang Xiu, he respectfully said, “This guy just ran away and I caught him, Boss.”</p><p>After speaking, he directly dumped Gillon to the floor.</p><p>Tang Xiu nodded with a dim smile. Then he watched Gillon, who had just jumped up from the floor, and asked, “I spent some energy and efforts in rescuing you from prison, and you also promised to pledge loyalty to me. Yet you broke your own word when you ran away and wanted to betray me?”</p><p>Seeing Getae’s dead body on the floor immediately shook Gillon’s heart. However, he gritted his teeth and bit the bullet, “You’ve rescued me indeed, but everyone has their own aspirations. What I want the most is freedom, not to be shackled and restricted by anyone. I’ll naturally pay back your grace in the future, but I’ll never give you all of my life!”</p><p>The smile on Tang Xiu’s face grew brighter. He watched Gillon’s solemn expression and applauded, “Not bad, you do need freedom indeed.”</p><p>Gillon looked excited and hurriedly asked, “So, you’d like to let me go?”</p><p>“Of course!” Tang Xiu nodded and said, “Not only will I let you go, but I’ll also send you to a heavenly place myself.”</p><p>Gillon looked jubilant and turned around toward the gambling hall’s door under the watchful eyes of the crowd.</p><p>Tang Xiu flicked the cigarette butt and spoke with a crisp voice, “I’ve already told you all that the life of each prisoner I’ve purchased from prison is forever under my control, right? I also said that I have cast a forbidden seal on you all; I can make your soul scatter with only a mere thought and you will never reincarnate.”</p><p>Whoosh…</p><p>A wind appeared out of nowhere, propping up Tang Xiu’s body to float half a meter high. With arms folded behind his back, he coldly shouted, “Die!”</p><p>Gillon’s body, who was quickly heading outside, suddenly turned stiff and blood sprayed out of his mouth in a frenzy. His body then fell softly to the floor with no breath left.</p><p>Spectre, who stood nearby, had a change in expression. He flashed to the side of Gillon and then put his fingers on the guy’s nostrils. Half a minute later, he struggled to stand up from the floor, observing Mo Awu and his group, and cupped his fists as he said, “Spectre will always be loyal to you, Boss!”</p><p>He died, just like that?</p><p>Nearly 200 prisoners in the gambling hall watched Gillon Touma’s body with a flustered and horrified look. Back when Tang Xiu killed Getae by manipulating the Mitsubishi army knife and then burned Yale Sass with flames, it was still in their scope of cognition, but when Getae died after Tang Xiu merely shouted at him sent a quake that stirred their souls.</p><p>Could it be that… what he told them was true? That he had control over their life and death and he even could send them to die instantly?</p><p>The vision of the nearly 200 prisoners slowly shifted towards Tang Xiu who was standing in the air. They cupped their firsts with a frightened look, yet their voices were surprisingly in sync, “We will always be loyal to you, Boss.”</p><p>Tang Xiu nodded in satisfaction and casually said, “Though your mouths can say good things, it’s meaningless to me; what I want to see is your actions. Of course, I don’t mind if you betray me because no matter if you flee to the ends of the Earth, you will die immediately should I will you to die.”</p><p>“How did you do it, Boss?” asked Spectre.</p><p>“I cast a restriction seal on the body; precisely, the heart” explained Tang Xiu. “But you’re weak, making it so you are unable to sense that you’re under control while I can clearly sense it. Just wait until your strength progresses by leaps and bounds; then you will be able to sense its horror.”</p><p>All the prisoners were so frightened that their faces turned ghastly pale and fear filled their eyes. At this moment, they finally realized their tragic end if they dared to go against Tang Xiu’s will.</p><p>Looking at their expression, Tang Xiu felt more satisfied; he even wanted to thank those three fellows for being reckless with their lives. If not for those three, how would he have warned the rest of these former rouges to completely obey him?</p><p>However, he also knew that continuing with such strong intimidation at this time wouldn’t help without giving the carrot. Only by using the carrot and stick technique could their hearts be truly subdued.</p><p>Hence, Tang Xiu looked around and spoke again, “There’s no need for you all to be restless and anxious. I’m not one who indiscriminately kills those without sins, nor do I resort to wanton killings. As long as you’re loyal to me, not only will I not harm you, I’ll also reward you. I’ll impart you a set of immortal cultivation techniques after we arrive at the next temporary location you all will be staying at. As long as you practice it seriously, your strength will rapidly increase in the future—you will even become thousands of times stronger than you are right now.”</p><p>Although Chen Yan’s parents were Chinese, she had lived abroad with her parents since childhood and had never heard of immortal cultivators. Therefore, she gathered her courage to ask loudly, “Boss, what exactly are immortal cultivation techniques and how should we cultivate? Also, you said that… by practicing it seriously, can we really be thousands of times stronger than we are now?”</p><p>“Be patient. You’ll naturally know what immortal cultivation techniques are and how to cultivate them once we arrive at our next temporary base,” answered Tang Xiu. “As for whether you can be thousands of times stronger than the current you, in the end, it’s up to your own efforts.”</p><p>“I’ll definitely work hard, Boss,” said Chen Yan loudly.</p><p>Tang Xiu had a bit of a good impression towards this lucky woman and he nodded in response at her words. After discouraging these people, he casually spoke some more words and left directly, while Jin Shi and the rest then disposed of the two dead bodies and the pile of ashes on the floor.</p><p>Prior to this incident, all the attendants had been ordered to go out because Tang Xiu had to have a show. They now came back, but after Tang Xiu ordered these people not to make things difficult for the staff, the prisoners now treated the attendants with a much better attitude. Even some of the desperados who had planned to take the beautiful waiters back to their rooms to vent their anger didn’t dare to have such ideas now.</p><p>The world had a lot of women everywhere, but they only have one life! If they were to molest these waiters on this liner and then Tang Xiu killed them, that was not worth the price and was utterly stupid.</p><p>As daybreak came, earthquake-like news rocked Israel. In just a few hours, all countries all over the world learned about this huge sensation: The warden of labor camp 1319 abused his power for personal gain and organized inmate matches in the underground fighting arena, eventually leading to the successful escape of 201 prisoners from the prison who were nowhere to be found.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
