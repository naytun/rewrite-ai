He stared at Tang Xiu for a long while before he finally decided to not act foolhardy. He then said in fluent Mandarin, “We are looking for someone in China, not to stir up some troubles. We won’t kill anyone here, but your Chinese Special Ability Bureau’s people attacked us.”</p><p>“Be it the killing and blood sucking, either is similar concept,” said Duanmu Lin. “You all Bloodkin need blood, but don’t suck it out of Chinese citizens.”</p><p>“We only took a small volume of blood from them! Their lives will never be in danger and they will only feel weak for a short time,” angrily retorted the handsome youth. “Besides, we made them faint before we sucked their blood. There’s no way we’ll expose our identity, to begin with. On top of it, those women all like money and we left them quite a sum of money for them in the hotel.”</p><p>“You left them money too?” Tang Xiu was amazed. “How much?”</p><p>“Ten thousand,” answered the youth.</p><p>“Ten thousand yuan? Quite a lot indeed.” Tang Xiu nodded. “It should be enough for them to buy nutritional supplements to recover the lost blood.”</p><p>“It’s in GBP, mind you. Pound sterling” added the youth. “But those women were just idiots. They didn’t know GBP, even they call the cops. Truly bloody idiots.”</p><p>Cough, cough…</p><p>Tang Xiu couldn’t help but feel shame for these women. Their blood was taken for a small volume, yet they were actually paid for eighty thousand-plus yuan. If they truly liked money, he was sure they would be glad after figuring it out.</p><p>“Tang Xiu!”</p><p>Ouyang Lulu jogged from the distance and happily grabbed Tang Xiu’s arm. Her looks made everyone around shocked, including even Duanmu Lin.</p><p>Tang Xiu slightly smiled at her. He then looked at the youth and asked again, “Anyways, who’s this person you’re looking for, exactly?”</p><p>“My sister, Shanjenna,” answered the handsome youth.</p><p>“Are you from Salzburg, by chance?” Tang Xiu asked in surprise.</p><p>The expression of the handsome youth slightly changed and he asked in a heavy tone, “How did you know? Who the bloody hell are you?”</p><p>Tang Xiu beckoned with a smile and looked at Duanmu Lin, “Elderly Duanmu, you can give them to me! I can assure you that they will never make any trouble in our country, nor will any blood-sucking incidents like before happen again. I’ll make them leave China in up to a week.”</p><p>“I can set my mind at rest and I trust you. But do you know them?” asked Duanmu Lin with a frown.</p><p>“Well, there’s a Bloodkin living in this Paradise Club actually. And, it’s exactly his younger sister, Shanjenna,” said Tang Xiu with a smile.</p><p>Duanmu Lin thought for a moment before he nodded and said, “If so, then you’ll take care of the rest.”</p><p>With that said, he didn’t dilly dally nor muddle anything in the slightest and led the Elementalists of the Special Ability Bureau to leave quickly. After they left Paradise Manor, a burly middle-aged man asked Duanmu Lin with indignant face, “Chief, who exactly is the owner of this Paradise Club, and why did you give him those Bloodkin? If these vampires were to create chaos, wouldn’t it be hard for us to get rid of them?”</p><p>A smile appeared on Duanmu Lin’s old face as he replied, “You’ve just come out from your cultivation in seclusion, so you don’t know much about recent events. The most powerful force in our country is not our Special Ability Bureau, but his Everlasting Feast Hall. Even I still can’t figure out how terrifying the Everlasting Feast Hall’s power truly is so far.”</p><p>“The Everlasting Feast Hall? How come I haven’t heard of it before?” The middle-aged man was confused.</p><p>“The Everlasting Feast Hall has been staying extremely low-key in the past; even I only learned about it two years ago,” explained Duanmu Lin. “Only after a recent special high-profile appearance of Tang Xiu did I figure out some facts about them, yet even the tip of the iceberg shown by the Everlasting Feast Hall displayed a strength that surpassed our Special Ability Bureau, maybe even a thousand times.”</p><p>Hiss…</p><p>The middle-aged man gasped and asked in a shock, “That’s truly a very terrifying force, but how can the country allow…”</p><p>Duanmu Lin raised his hand to interrupt him. He shook his head and forced a bitter smile. “The Country? Let alone our country, even if all the countries in the world were to join forces, I’m afraid it will be close to impossible to annihilate the Everlasting Feast Hall. Do remember to never provoke this group of cultivators in the future. They won’t intervene in mundane affairs, nor will they encroach the precincts of another.”</p><p>Cultivators?</p><p>The burly middle-aged man shuddered a few times inwardly. He had seen such powerful cultivators in the past, yet it was still a great shock to him that the Everlasting Feast Hal was actually comprised of cultivators.</p><p>“So, that Tang Xiu is…”</p><p>“I can’t really figure out his identity either, truthfully speaking,” said Duanmu Lin helplessly. “All the cultivators of the Everlasting Feast Hall address him as a Boss, but the terrifying existence who founded the Everlasting Feast Hall calls him Master. Some people who are older than him even address him as Grand Master.”</p><p>“This…”</p><p>The stocky middle-aged man was dumbfounded. Such seniority and generational ranks made him faintly shudder inside. It was because Tang Xiu was very young, yet he already had grand disciples. Most important of all was, who exactly was his Master and did he have other elders in his school?</p><p>Back to the Paradise Manor.</p><p>Tang Xiu brought the seven vampires from Salzburg to the European-styled building where Shanjenna was staying in. Ouyang Lulu brewed fragrant tea as Tang Xiu asked her, “Where is Shanjenna, though? There was a fight here; it’s unlikely that she didn’t notice it and is not showing up.”</p><p>“Well, Professor Mo Yi took a lot of her blood yesterday, so she got angry and then went out to find Han Jintong to complain about last night. I tried calling her, but she shut off her mobile.”</p><p>“What did you say?” Shanzeley’s complexion drastically changed as he abruptly got up and shouted, “You dare you to take out my younger sister’s blood? Don’t you know taking out the blood of vampires will cause great harm to us?”</p><p>Tang Xiu rolled his eyes at him and lightly said, “If Shanjenna thinks that she’d be harmed, she would’ve ditched her cooperation with us to study her blood already. Just have a taste of this medicinal pill. If you feel that it tastes good, then stay here for a week and help the research of my researchers.”</p><p>Medicinal pill?</p><p>Shanzeley had received a call from his younger sister, Shanjenna, and learned the matter about the said medicinal pill from her. He looked at the crystal-clear medicinal pill in his hand and hesitated for a short while. Then he threw it to the Bloodkin behind him and said in a deep voice, “You take it.”</p><p>“Aye!” the young vampire didn’t hesitate and straightly swallowed the medicinal pill right into his belly.</p><p>“Aargh…”</p><p>That Bloodkin’s face massively changed after a few seconds as his body began spasming. His wings suddenly spread out in an instant, with eyes turned bloodshot and fangs elongated.</p><p>In a flash, Shanzeley and the other five vampires vigilantly released their wings and prepared for battle.</p><p>“Idiot,” commented Tang Xiu as he shot an indifferent glare at Shanzeley. He crossed his legs and took out a cigarette before lighting it up leisurely and smoking.</p><p>Time fleeted by and after two-plus minutes, a strong aura bust out from that vampire. His wings grew much bigger, while the lines on them became clearer and the mysterious runes inscribed on them increased in number. The scene made Shanzeley and the rest of the vampires instantly realize that this was the sign of his strengthening bloodlines as well as his strength promotion.</p><p>“I… did I just break through to the Count rank?” exclaimed the vampire with overjoyed surprise.</p><p>Shanzeley’s jaw dropped and he was hardly able to turn his head to look at Tang Xiu. He finally understood why Tang Xiu called him an idiot. He clearly gave him the pill, yet he threw it to his underling. What if… it was himself who took that pill? Wouldn’t he be able to break through from Count to Marquis rank?</p><p>‘Bloody woe me!’</p><p>Shanzeley watched his underling with an envious look. He took a deep breath and retracted back his wings and withdrew his bloody eyes and fangs. Then he let out a dry smile and said, “You’re… Mr. Tang, yes? May I know whether you still have that medicinal pill?”</p><p>Tang Xiu rolled his eyes again at his words and snappily replied, “You think such a miraculous pill is common as cabbage—that you can ask for them however much you want? Do you know how many resources I spent to concoct that kind of pill?”</p><p>“… This…”</p><p>Shanzeley scratched his hands and replied with a remorseful yet vexed face, “I admit I was in the wrong, Mr. Tang. But you Chinese have an old adage like an adult should be magnanimous for kid’s mistake, right? Could you please … sell it… err, right, sell me some of these pills? I promise to buy them at a high price!”</p><p>“High price, eh?” said Tang Xiu with a strange expression, “How high is high?”</p><p>The moment Shanzeley heard it, his spirit soared to the sky and he replied immediately with shocking enthusiasm, “I’ll give you a hundred million pounds for one pill!”</p><p>Cough, cough…</p><p>Tang Xiu just inhaled a big puff of smoke and directly choked after hearing Shanzeley’s offer. A hundred million pounds for one pill? This stuff only spent a few million yuan at most—could he sell it for such a sky-high price? Nevertheless, he felt relieved when he gave it a thought since this type of pill was rather common to him, but for vampires, a medicinal pill that could upgrade their bloodline rank was an absolute treasure!</p><p>“200 million pounds. Take it or leave it.”</p><p>After thinking it through and clearly understanding it, Tang Xiu straightly demanded an exorbitant price.</p><p>Shanzeley looked hesitant for a short while before he finally nodded heavily, “I’ll take it. How many do you have?”</p><p>“A hundred,” answered Tang Xiu.</p><p>“Come again?”</p><p>Shanzeley shivered for a while, dumbstruck with astonishment as he watched Tang Xiu and asked again.</p><p>Tang Xiu repeated, “A hundred.”</p><p>Shanzeley’s jaws dropped before he immediately gritted his teeth, “If your pill has the same effect as the one you just gave me, I’ll buy them all. But twenty billion pounds is not a small amount and I’ll need half a month to get the money.”</p><p>Tang Xiu casually nodded at his words, yet he was quite shocked inwardly. It must be noted that 200 million pounds converted to Chinese yuan was nearly around 200 billion yuan! How could these vampires have such a huge fortune? Granted that if… they had accumulated such wealth for centuries or even millenniums, could they still have enough to burn it like this?</p><p>Suddenly, Tang Xiu was reminded by something. He followed up, “If you can’t get so much cash, it’s fine to exchange it for some other things such as jadeite and agate; gold, silver, pearls, and other treasures; or even precious mineral and herbs. You can exchange it with the remains of high-rank fierce beasts!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
