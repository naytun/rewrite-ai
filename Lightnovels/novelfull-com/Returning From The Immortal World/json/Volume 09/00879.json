He had obviously offended some people, yet he still couldn’t realize it.</p><p>“Pa…”</p><p>He slapped Miao Jinlei out of anger and yelled, “They are Tang Xiu’s Tang Family, Zhang Yueming’s Zhang Family, Gu Changmin’s Gu Family, and Zhang Qingfeng of the Zhang. Of these four families, you already fucking know the Tang Family, who is a truly powerful house in Beijing, but the Zhang, Gu, and Zhang Qingfeng’s family are all powerful aristocratic families in Shanghai. Which any of them has wealth less than 10 billion yuan or has no strong network and connections? Yet you provoke four of them all of a sudden. Do you want them to join up and destroy our family?”</p><p>Miao Jinlei covered his cheek and trembled in pain. He was almost going mad. He felt that except for Tang Xiu who he had offended, Zhang Yueming and Gu Changmin were the ones who bullied him! And, where and when did he make Zhang Qingfeng displeased?</p><p>Miao Wentang saw the angry and confused expression of his nephew and felt more disappointed immediately. With trembling hands, he took a cigarette, lit it up and took a few puffs before taking a seat at the edge of the bed and said indifferently, “You still don’t get it, do you?”</p><p>“How can I understand it? I only offended Tang Xiu; where and when did I provoke those three?” screamed Miao Jinlei.</p><p>The statement made Miao Wentang really want to kick him again, but he finally held back and angrily said aloud, “Zhang Yueming and Gu Changmin stood for Tang Xiu back in the charity auction. Do you know what that means; that they will stand up against you if they don’t have an excellent relationship? Last night’s charity event was hosted by Zhang Qingfeng and you’ve literally slapped his face and made him look ugly in the public’s eyes. Now tell me, are those not enough to offend them? Whether it’s Zhang Yueming, Gu Changmin, or Zhang Qingfeng, they will think that you have disrespected them. Is this not offending them?”</p><p>Miao Jinlei didn’t realize this issue back then as anger barred him from being able to notice it. Only now did he suddenly wake up after hearing the reprimands from his uncle, Miao Wentang. His anger subsided instantly and his whole being felt the pressure and was scared.</p><p>Miao Wentang snorted and turned to look at the girl shivering under the quilt and shouted, “Pick up your clothes to get dressed and quickly scram from this place. If you ever dare to contact this kid later, I’ll throw and feed you to the fish in the Huangpu River.”</p><p>“…I…”</p><p>The girl was flustered and glanced at Miao Jinlei only to find that he didn’t spare a glance at all. She hastily wrapped her body with a quilt in a terrified manner before picking up her clothes scattered everywhere on the floor, then rushed out of the bedroom with bare feet. After dressing quickly, she dared not stay much longer and left the room in a hurry.</p><p>Miao Wentang finished smoking the whole cigarette and accurately threw the butt into the ashtray. Then one of his feet kicked Miao Jinlei before he got up and walked toward the door, “You guys take him to the hospital and keep an eye on him properly. If he goes out to make trouble again, I’ll skin him alive.”</p><p>“Understood!”</p><p>The two middle-aged big men glared at Miao Jinlei with a grim face and pulled him up from the floor roughly. They still vividly remembered when this fella called them the dogs raised by Miao Wentang.</p><p>“Hey, be gentle!” screamed Miao Jinlei pitifully.</p><p>Miao Wentang only glanced at his nephew being dragged out with apathetic look. He had an impulse to rush to Bluestar villa complex to see Tang Xiu right away, but he looked at the time and knew that Tang Xiu was probably unavailable now. If he were to rashly disturb him from his sleep, it was more likely that Tang Xiu would be very angry at him.</p><p>“Alas! It doesn’t matter if those three got offended even though they have power and money in Shanghai since they won’t be able to affect my family in Haiqing Province. But the big problem is having Tang Xiu riled up, particularly with those words he mentioned to me on the phone. If he refuses to help solve that predicament, then…”</p><p>Miao Wentang took out a cigarette again while the words Tang Xiu told him kept echoing inside his mind. Only after a long time did he finally take out a mobile phone from his pocket and dial a cell number. Then, he said, “There’s a yellow box in the safe at home. Give it to Er Hu and tell him to leave for Shanghai to give it to me ASAP. I need that urgently.”</p><p>With that said, he hung up and dialed another cell number.</p><p>“It’s very early for you to call me, Second Brother. Something happens?” The voice of Miao Wentang’s big brother, Miao Wenye, was heard inquiring over the phone.</p><p>“Quite an accident, Big Brother…” said Miao Wentang with a bitter smile.</p><p>After narrating the whole story, Miao Wentang finally said bitterly, “I know too well about Tang Xiu, older brother. He definitely isn’t a revengeful man for trivial grievances, nor will he speak out nonsensical things for no reason.”</p><p>“What a waste, that bastard! You help me break his legs, Second Brother!” Miao Wentang furiously thundered on the phone. He was truly enraged and hated his son, even if he was his own kin.</p><p>“First, pipe down, Big Brother. I already taught that wastrel just now,” said Miao Wentang bitterly. “The most important thing for us to do is to find a way to make Tang Xiu comply to help solve the disaster looming over our family. You also know about the Old Blind from Miao Region and her terrifying abilities. Tang Xiu is her successor and I believe he can help our family with his terrifying heritage.”</p><p>“Do you have a way to make him help us?” asked Miao Wenye hurriedly.</p><p>“I don’t; that’s why I want your jade tiger,” said Miao Wentang. “Added to the jade dragon in my hand, he may be willing to help us after seeing these two objects.”</p><p>“About that…” Miao Wenye hesitated.</p><p>“I’m well aware that the jade dragon and tiger are our family heirlooms, big brother,” said Miao Wentang. “It’s also recorded in our genealogy that these two are the treasures of the whole set of zodiacs made of jade. But if our family really encounters the calamity that Tang Xiu has prophesied, even these two things won’t be able to help us then!”</p><p>Miao Wenye considered things for a long time before sighing, “Haih… alright. Send someone to come over to fetch it!”</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>****</p><p>Shanghai, Bluestar villa complex.</p><p>Tang Xiu had just wakened up from his sleep. After taking a shower, he came downstairs and saw Mu Wanying just came out of the kitchen in an apron, accompanied by the scent of meal that hit his nose.</p><p>“Well, I was just thinking as for when I have to wake you up,” said Mu Wanying with a smile after seeing Tang Xiu.</p><p>Tang Xiu scrutinized her appearance and sighed, “Say, Wanying. Other men will likely be surprised and jaw dropped if they see you wear an apron like a housewife, don’t you think? But still, seeing you dress up like this kinda gives you another vibe, you know.”</p><p>Mu Wanying smiled with eyes bent and said in a shy and gentle voice, “Well, I can stay at home every day and be your housewife if you want me to.”</p><p>Tang Xiu couldn’t help but burst into laughter and said, “Although I really want to, thanks, but forget it! I’ll be too excessive and condescending to ask you to stay at home. I’ll be wasting your talent then. Anyways, let’s have a meal, shall we?”</p><p>Mu Wanying was quite a cook, as her four dishes and one soup were full of flavor and delicious.</p><p>Just as the duo put down their chopsticks, Mo Awu came in from the outside and whispered, “Boss, Miao Wentang is here.”</p><p>Tang Xiu and Mu Wanying exchanged glances with a similar expression as the former chuckled and said immediately, “I didn’t expect that he would be truly scared of my nonsensical drivel yesterday. Alright, Awu. Tell him to come in.”</p><p>“Got it!”</p><p>Mo Awu complied and walked away in strides. Without long, he took Miao Wentang to the living room.</p><p>After Tang Xiu and Mu Wanying came out of the dining room, they saw the gloomy Miao Wentang. Tang Xiu deliberately let out a forced smile and said, “Brother Miao, didn’t you say you’d be coming to Shanghai a couple of days later? How come you are you coming over now? Is it for your nephew?”</p><p>“I have beaten that bastard brat and sent him into the hospital, Brother Tang,” said Miao Wentang with a bitter smile. “I also rushed to the other three families, hoping that they wouldn’t take offense of what he did. Though yes, I did come here mainly regarding what you told me last night.”</p><p>Tang Xiu greeted Miao Wentang to take a seat. Then he shook his head and said, “Brother Miao, I said some things that I shouldn’t have said last night, so there’s no need for you to look for me for the following matter. Having ten years of lifespan taken away for revealing it is not something I can afford.”</p><p>The price was ten years reduced lifespan?</p><p>Miao Wentang’s heart was as though severely struck by a thunderbolt. He couldn’t help but tremble a few times with a pale face as he said, “We’ve been through hardships together and we’re brothers, Brother Tang. I know it’s not proper for me to pay you with money to help me and my family no matter the amount. But…”</p><p>Tang Xiu didn’t reply and stayed silent for a long time before he said, “Alright then, let me consider it! Also, it’s still a few years away from that day so there’s no need to be anxious.”</p><p>Except for the helplessness that filled his heart, Miao Wentang truly didn’t know what else to say. Tang Xiu might not be anxious, but for him, he was literally restless! After all, this was all about the safety of his Miao Family.</p><p>Immediately after, the two men engaged in brief small talk and Miao Wentang could see that Tang Xiu really couldn’t make up his mind. He didn’t want to force him anymore and found an excuse to leave, but he told Tang Xiu that he would come again the night before he left.</p><p>In the living room.</p><p>Mu Wanying watched Miao Wentang’s back as he disappeared and then asked in a whisper, “How do you want this to end up?”</p><p>“That’s super easy,” said Tang Xiu calmly. “I want Miao Jinlei to learn his lesson. If the Miao family expels him and makes him live on his own, it would be for the best. I can casually pick the means I have to fool them and get this thing done.”</p><p>Mu Wanying nodded and said, “Let’s be done talking about this. By the way, what are your plans for today?”</p><p>“Haven’t thought about it yet,” answered Tang Xiu with a smile.</p><p>Mu Wanying suddenly looked spirited and asked, “Would you like to go with me to my firm? The company has expanded and it’s now several times bigger. The business is very great nowadays, but I want you to come with me again to deter the people in my company.”</p><p>“Huh?” Tang Xiu was at a loss whether he had to cry or laugh, “Aren’t you the respected Boss? Why would you need me to deter your own employees?”</p><p>Mu Wanying looked a bit squeamish as she grabbed Tang Xiu’s arm and said, “Of course I need you to do that! It’s all because of you that the firm has grown to this scale, so the top executives in the company are kinda reverent towards you. I’m absolutely sure that as long as you come to my company to keep them in check, none of them will have any disloyalty toward me from now on.”</p><p>‘Why do I feel like a Buddha Rulai, who really has the power to slap Wuzhi Mountain?!’</p><p>Tang Xiu smiled after speaking. He thought that he had nothing to do today, so he simply said, “Well, since I have such great power and influence, then I’ll go accompany you! But promise you’ll treat me to lunch today!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
