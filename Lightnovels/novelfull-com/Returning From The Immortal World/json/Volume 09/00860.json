Tang Xiu, however, didn’t expect that he would actually encounter such an incident that was merely normal in the Immortal World. Still… it was obviously the revenge of a mortal enemy.</p><p>“What should we do now, Boss?”</p><p>The intent for murder similarly gleamed inside Mo Awu’s eyes. He had undergone inhuman training ever since he was a child and had spent decades in risking his life through the blaze of war. Such a scene before him invoked his long-lost desire of battle and combat to rise to the surface.</p><p>“Let’s find Wang Xuezhong first,” said Tang Xiu. “I need to see him in person if he’s still alive, or his corpse if he’s dead.”</p><p>“How should we find Wang Xuezhong?” Mo Awu frowned and said, “We haven’t met him, nor do we have his photo at all.”</p><p>Tang Xiu lightly smiled and his figure instantly rose into the sky. When he flew over the burning hall, he saw a group of nearly 100 people surrounding an antique building in front. Without hesitation, he instantly appeared on the highest point of the roof of the building.</p><p>“Who are you?”</p><p>Several shouts came from the nearly 100 people crowded around as two shadows then appeared in the air in an instant, staring at Tang Xiu.</p><p>Tang Xiu glanced at the two people yet still ignored them, even though their cultivation slightly surprised him. He watched the courtyard below instead, and then said, “Who is Wang Xuezhong among you? Come out to see me!”</p><p>During his speech, Mo Awu’s group of three also quickly appeared around Tang Xiu.</p><p>At present, there were only a dozen wounded experts left from Qingcheng Monastery in the courtyard, watching the surroundings fully armed. The entire courtyard had been shrouded inside an array and invisible energy protected everyone inside it. Among the dozen or so people was a tall old man with a childlike face sporting a crane hairdo with eyes gleaming with light.</p><p>That loud voice was like blasting thunder. The old man heard someone call his name and the question came from someone outside the enemy’s group. Seeing those who appeared on the roof of the building as well as the two enemies standing in front of them, he could immediately tell that the four people on the roof were definitely not enemies.</p><p>He and the remaining dozen of Qingcheng Monastery’s strongest experts were nearly falling into despair because of their enemies’ acts of revenge, but at this moment, his eyes shone and seemed to have regained back their spirit. Wang Xuezhong then took two steps forward as he looked up and said to Tang Xiu, “I’m Wang Xuezhong; may I know who you are, sir?”</p><p>Tang Xiu looked at him and observed him for a short while before nodding with a gratified expression, saying, “Great, it’s rather fortunate that you’re still alive, else we’d have to spend quite the effort to find you. Can you tell me whether the Red Silk Flower given by your nephew is still in your hands?”</p><p>Red Silk Flower?</p><p>Wang Xuezhong slightly creased his brows but still replied, “It’s still in my hands, why?”</p><p>“You haven’t used it yet?” asked Tang Xiu.</p><p>“No,” answered Wang Xuezhong.</p><p>Tang Xiu looked glad and asked again, “Since you still have preserved it, how about making a deal with me?”</p><p>Wang Xuezhong’s expression changed and he hurriedly asked, “What exactly is this deal you’re offering to me, sir?”</p><p>“I’ll help you get rid of these people in front; in exchange, give me that Red Silk Flower. What do you think?” asked Tang Xiu.</p><p>Wang Xuezhong’s eyes lit up and he answered, “If you can really help remove the crisis of our Qingcheng Monastery and completely kill these people, I’ll definitely offer you the Red Silk Flower with open hands.”</p><p>Tang Xiu let out a pale smile and shifted his gaze towards the two men standing in the air in front. Then he said, “I don’t know who you are. I’m somewhat concerned if we should really cross paths here. Tell me your origins, else you really must die in this Qingcheng Mountain today.”</p><p>The burly man with a knife scar on his face, Bai Biao, stared at Tang Xiu and coldly said, “You are not qualified to learn of our origins as of yet, sir. But I advise you to leave this place quickly, else it won’t be us whose bodies will be buried in Qingcheng Mountain—it will be you all.”</p><p>“If you can’t differentiate what’s good and bad, then don’t blame for claiming your lives.” Tang Xiu shook his head and said, “After all, the value of your lives compared to the Red Silk Flower is like the distance across a chasm.”</p><p>As his voice faded away, Tang Xiu unleashed a four array disk in an instant. Along with the flashing array disk, he immediately inscribed the array diagram and pushed his hands forward as the Four Divisions Array instantly arranged in just a second. After activating it, Tang Xiu lifted his right hand and shouted, “Lightning inducement, unleash electricity!”</p><p>Countless lightning bolts suddenly appeared from the clear night sky all of a sudden and then bolted downward toward the two people inside the Four Divisions Array without any omen whatsoever. Immediately after, a band of thunderbolts radiated a faint blue light as the lightning quickly penetrated the Four Divisions Array and struck down to the heads of the two men lightning fast.</p><p>“GODDAMMIT!”</p><p>“BASTARD!”</p><p>The two brothers, Bai Zhen and Bai Biao, had their expressions drastically shift. Layers of flame suddenly appeared out of the blue as they turned into two fire dragons that ferociously clawed out of the layer of flame to greet the lightning bolts.</p><p>BOOM…</p><p>The dazzling, yet blinding, explosion blinded most of everyone’s eyes present for a short time, while the detonation of the loud explosion caused their ears to buzz. The nearly 100 killer experts around the courtyard, except for more than 10 with a cultivation foundation that could endure and stay safe albeit constantly backtracking, were shaken to the core. They felt their blood and Qi boil and then fell to the ground while spurting out blood.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>Three silhouettes moved lightning fast towards those who fell to the ground along with their longsword that cut through the expansive sky, sending out sword beams that claimed the lives of those fallen to the ground.</p><p>“Crack…”</p><p>Violent energy suddenly destroyed the Four Divisions Array, shutting off the imprisoning function that trapped Bai Zhen and Bai Biao inside it. But as the two fire dragons were shattered by the lightning bolts, the lightning balls directly barraged the two brothers to the ground, causing their bodies to dye red with their blood. Even though they survived the ordeal, the grave injuries caused them to lose their combat efficiency.</p><p>“Who exactly are you?” After crazily spraying out a few mouthfuls of blood, Bai Biao looked up and bellowed angrily.</p><p>“I didn’t expect that such a powerful strike would be unable to kill you both.” Tang Xiu sighed. “It seems that you’re just a hair away from breaking through to the Golden Core stage. It’s rather unfortunate for you that you’ll only meet a dead end today. There’s no need for you to know who I am either, for I’m not going to go to your so-called hell since you’ll never see me again.”</p><p>Bai Zhen struggled to get up from the ground and roared, “Monsignor, if you wish to have the Red Silk Flower, we brothers can find it for you. We admit that we were too arrogant, so I hope that you don’t take it to heart. We came to Qingcheng Monastery this time all because of the blood enmity that is deep as the ocean between us.”</p><p>Tang Xiu touched his chin and asked, “Then tell me, what is this deep blood enmity between you and the Qingcheng Monastery?”</p><p>A delighted look flashed in Bai Zhen’s eyes and he answered loudly, “Senior, we used to be villagers who lived around Qingcheng Mountain and someone from Qingcheng Monastery recruited us to help them buy daily necessities and living supply from the outside world. At first, they treated us—the six brothers— quite well and we were also happy and satisfied with our life then. But after a few years, the steward, which was the supervisor in charge of the living materials, began to embezzle and deduct our wages, even often bullying us just because they are martial arts experts.”</p><p>“On one occasion, my younger brother, Bai Don, was delivering the kitchen necessities he had purchased to the Qingcheng Monastery. He accidentally saw someone from Qingcheng Monastery practising his martial arts. That someone was the living materials’ supervisor bastard at the time, and he slandered my younger brother in having stolen Qingcheng school’s martial arts and finally beat him to half death.”</p><p>“The rest of us five brothers came to him to ask for justice, yet we were also beaten mercilessly. Due to anger, I proposed to no longer help them buy materials in the future and was driven with fury that time. I said that I’ll expose the deeds of these Qingcheng Monastery’s people to the others, which then caused them to be hell-bent on killing us.”</p><p>“We used to be brothers of six, either blood brothers or cousins. In the end, they killed four of us. I and my fourth brother, Bai Biao, then fell off the cliff during our escape, and yet it finally saved our poor lives just by a fluke—pure luck.</p><p>“We dragged out our ignoble existence by living in seclusion over the years. Then we had a fortuitous encounter and were able to get some cultivation techniques in our hands, which then greatly improved our strength through cultivation practice. Afterwards, we crossed the ocean and fled abroad until we met with our Master, the Dao Master of Poison. And yet, never has the thought of revenge to avenge our grievance left our mind even for a second all these years.”</p><p>“Now that I have told you about it, Senior. Please tell me, is it wrong for us to come to Qingcheng Monastery for our revenge?</p><p>Tang Xiu fell into silence. He could understand this kind of hatred and enmity. Had it been himself, he would probably do something more ruthless than what they did.</p><p>He originally wanted to exterminate these people in front, but after hearing the whole story of the matter, he was a bit reluctant to move his hand.</p><p>Inside the courtyard.</p><p>The Head Abbot of Qingcheng Monastery, Lin Tong, stepped forward and shouted, “It’s nothing but nonsense coming from thieves; pure slander! You all brothers of six were just hiding in our Qingcheng Monastery to steal our martial arts and also the Qingcheng school martial arts ancient manuals, so we sent people to hunt you down to take back our martial arts ancient manuals!”</p><p>“What a damn fucking fart!” Bai Zhen furiously cursed. “Although we brothers are all hunters, we have no hope of learning martial arts, let alone stealing your Qingcheng school’s martial arts classics! In the beginning, it was the steward of your Qingcheng Monastery who stuffed it into my younger brother’s hand when he killed him. I was able to clearly see what he did even though I was escaping then!”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>More than a dozen Qingcheng Monastery experts in the courtyard exchanged glances in dismay. They only knew the report from the steward who said that the six men who usually helped the Qingcheng Monastery to purchase living materials from outside had stolen their Qingcheng school’s martial arts classics, and therefore they were sent to chase and kill them.</p><p>How… and why did it become a trap to frame them as the scapegoats?</p><p>Bai Zhen raised his hand to wipe the bloodstain off the corner of his mouth and angrily continued his piece, “There’s no need for me to lie and deceive this Senior! I always loathe lying, for it was the very reason why the steward heartlessly wanted to kill us in the first place. It wasn’t for those threat words I spoke to him when I was furious, but because his daughter liked my younger brother; that was the chief reason why he had to eliminate us. He told me that time that his daughter must marry a man who’s at least the high-ranking junior of Qingcheng Monastery. You guessed it right! Mu Baizhi.”</p><p>In that instant, the eyes of more than a dozen people in the courtyard were all focused on a middle-aged woman holding a duster. Tang Xiu eyes followed their eyes and also observed the middle-aged woman who still retained her graceful and charming bearing.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
