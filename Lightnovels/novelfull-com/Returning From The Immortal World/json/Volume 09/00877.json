Your presence really makes tonight’s charity party flourish! All the blames are on me as I didn’t have time to check the guest list, else I wouldn’t have dared to be this negligent.”</p><p>Tang Xiu shook hands with him and smiled. “It’s all right. I’m just here to join in the fun while expressing my gratitude on the behalf of my girlfriend.”</p><p>Zhang Qingfeng was full of smiles and he knew that Tang Xiu was just returning the plum in exchange for the peach he had given. With him personally visiting, this gave him enough face. He knew that it was because he had handed over the entire advertising planning of his Zhang Group to Mu Wanying’s advertising company.</p><p>‘That is how a man should conduct and behave himself—with integrity!’ sighed Zhang Qingfeng inwardly.</p><p>He finally understood why Tang Xiu was able to make his business so big since the character of this young man was definitely worthy of deep friendship.</p><p>“You’ve spent quite the expense tonight, Mr. Tang. We shall have a private discussion another day since I have some friends who have a good network and I’m worried that their company doesn’t have an advertising company to cooperate with. I’ll tell introduce them to you and Boss Mu.”</p><p>A smile outlined on the corner of Tang Xiu’s mouth as he replied, “No problem. And, I shall express my thanks to you, Boss Zhang.”</p><p>“Well, speaking of age, I’m much older than you, but if you don’t reject me, you might as well call me Brother Zhang,” said Zhang Qingfeng with a smile. “Addressing me by Boss Zhang feels like I’m being treated as an outsider.”</p><p>“Alright then. But please don’t call me Mr. Tang either, Brother Zhang.” Tang Xiu nodded. “Just call me Tang Xiu or younger Brother Tang. Old Brothers Zhang and Gu always call me such.”</p><p>The smile on Zhang Qingfeng turned brighter as he nodded and said, “That’s settled, then. We brothers will get along well later since I can’t talk much with you now due to us holding a photo shoot, Brother Tang.”</p><p>“Alright.” Tang Xiu nodded with a smile.</p><p>As Zhang Qingfeng walked back to the podium, all the guests of the evening charity gala in the hall, who didn’t know Tang Xiu, looked shocked and burst into commentaries:</p><p>“Who exactly is this young man named Tang? To think that he can make Zhang Qingfeng call a break on the auction to come down and personally greet him? Besides, judging from his words, Zhang Qingfeng wants to hand over the advertising of some companies to this young man’s girlfriend? Isn’t this the same as fawning upon him?”</p><p>“Zhang Qingfeng’s net worth is not less than 10 billion yuan, yet even he acts very humble to befriend him? What great personage is this young man called Tang, exactly? Who is behind him?”</p><p>“Amazing! With just one auction, he literally attracted Zhang Yueming and Gu Changmin to stand up for him. Even Zhang Qingfeng is now currying favor with him. Even those scions from the rich families of Beijing probably don’t have that ability.”</p><p>“I feel that he’s rather familiar, but I can’t recall where I have seen him. But seeing how many bigwigs came to flatter him, I’m sure he’s definitely not your ordinary person.”</p><p>“If only I were as great as him, then I would’ve been the role model for my generation. It seems that I’ll have an idol in the future.”</p><p>“He’s so handsome. His girlfriend must be very happy to find such a handsome and resourceful boyfriend.”</p><p>“I know that woman! She’s the First Belle of Beijing, Mu Wanying. Just WOW! This guy is truly awesome. He could even nail such a fairy maiden.”</p><p>“Argh… it’d be great if he didn’t have a girlfriend.”</p><p>“…”</p><p>On the guest table.</p><p>Miao Jinlei clenched his fists with a grim face. The envy in his eyes was as though nearly spraying a blazing flame as they glared at Tang Xiu. It was just that he didn’t compete in the bid with Tang Xiu for no reason. He hadn’t ever seen Tang Xiu before and no enmity existed between them either.</p><p>But he was jealous because he had already recognized Mu Wanying’s identity, who he had been pursuing for some time, yet she, the most beautiful flower of Shanghai University, didn’t even spare a glance at him. He also brought a female companion to this charity gala tonight, and she was also a flower of Shanghai University that he had just pursued recently. His new girlfriend looked great usually, but was very far away when compared to Mu Wanying in his eyes.</p><p>‘Fucking bastard!’ Only at this moment did Miao Jinlei finally recognize Tang Xiu.</p><p>He was able to study at Shanghai University due to his uncle, Miao Wentang, who had spent enormous financial resources and used his network to make him a transfer student. This was to make him become friends with Tang Xiu there, and it would be best if he could become his hardcore buddy.</p><p>That was the original plan, and he did want to befriend Tang Xiu. After all, he knew that behind him was the Tang Family of Beijing. Befriending a scion with a deep background had many more benefits than downsides. But the sudden meeting and tonight’s conflict swept away all the thoughts he had of befriending Tang Xiu. There was nothing but intense embarrassment and anger in his heart now.</p><p>‘Amazing? What’s fucking amazing about it? Is it because he has the shade and shelter of his family elders? You are nothing but lesser than a fart without your Tang Family. I really can’t get what uncle has been thinking. Why on Earth did he want me to befriend this fucking asshole? There are so many other powerful and wealthy families in Beijing and much more scions who are very resourceful as well. With the power and wealth my Miao Family in the Haiqing Province has, they’ll probably be very happy to express their goodwill and make friends with me, no?’</p><p>As Miao Jinlei thought up to there, he suddenly slapped on the table and straightly dragged his girlfriend from her chair and headed outside with grim face.</p><p>He thought that Zhang Qingfeng, the host of the party, had smacked his face by fawning upon Tang Xiu; hence, he believed that there was no point in him staying any longer. He didn’t need to give Zhang Qingfeng face although his uncle had urged him to come to support Zhang Qingfeng, he refused to heed him anymore.</p><p>At this time, Zhang Qingfeng, who had just returned to the podium, looked dark and gloomy instantly. His eyes followed the back of Miao Jinlei and his female companion as they left, while a sliver of anger rushed from his heart into his head.</p><p>Meanwhile, the rest of the guests in the hall of the charity gala were keenly aware of Zhang Qingfeng’s unusual expression. They similarly turned around and saw the back of Miao Jinlei and his female companion, followed by a burst of whispers in the next moment:</p><p>“Whose junior is that to be so folly? With just a trivial dissatisfaction, he straightly slaps Zhang Qingfeng’s face?”</p><p>“I really don’t know which family has educated such a dumb brat. Who will be the most displeased by his actions? It’s none other than Zhang Qingfeng! He even has literally smacked Zhang Yueming and Gu Changmin!”</p><p>“Well, this young man really has no brain, so it doesn’t matter if he leaves. It’s just that I’m afraid he has offended the three giants at the same time. Whatever he wants to do in Shanghai, he’s doomed to hit stumbling blocks in the future.”</p><p>“Remember him and keep in mind that regardless of whether you already knew him or not before, you must never have any interactions with him again in the future. This kind of idiot is the likes of who will bring calamity to his elders and family.”</p><p>“Idiot!”</p><p>“…”</p><p>Tang Xiu himself also saw Miao Jinlei’s departure and the corner of his mouth curled up in a sneer. Then a smile climbed up his face to replace it as he leaned toward Mu Wanying and asked, “Do you know that guy?”</p><p>“I know him. He’s also a student of our Shanghai University.” Mu Wanying chuckled. “He grew up as a self-made man and has a wealthy family, though he’s also a womanizer.”</p><p>“Eh? Why do I feel like you sound like this guy is chasing you?” asked Tang Xiu with an odd expression.</p><p>“He does pursue me, but I flatly ignore him,” said Mu Wanying with a smile.</p><p>“That’s the first Campus Flower of Shanghai University and the First Belle of Beijing I know of. You know, you always bump into your former pursuers wherever you go.” Tang Xiu smiled while raising his thumb up. “By the way, you said this guy hails from a wealthy family; what does his family do, exactly?”</p><p>Somehow, Mu Wanying looked shy and she slightly lowered her head and replied, “His family is in Haiqing Province. He’s the nephew of Miao Group’s Big Boss, Miao Wentang.”</p><p>“So, he is that Miao Jinlei? The second-generation rich boy who just snatched the goddess in Old Hu’s mind recently, huh?” Tang Xiu was surprised. “Speaking about it, the female companion who is with him just now is…”</p><p>“I also heard about Hu Qingsong’s unrequited secret love for the goddess, who had been pursued for a long time, you know.” Mu Wanying chuckled and said, “It seems that he dragged Yue Kai and the others to get drunk yesterday. It’s just that I didn’t know if the one who was pursued by Miao Jinlei was that girl next to him.”</p><p>“Whether she is or not, I gotta call Miao Wentang to tell him that this brat is not good. This guy would spell doom for the Miao Group if the company were to be handed over to him in the future,” commented Tang Xiu with a smile.</p><p>“I already know that you have a good relationship with Miao Wentang,” said Mu Wanying with a chuckle. “But will your words be useful?”</p><p>“Do you want to hear and watch something later?” asked Tang Xiu with a faint smile.</p><p>“Huh? Watch what?” Mu Wanying was confused.</p><p>“Well, be patient and wait for now, alright?” Tang Xiu mysteriously smiled and grinned, “I’ll show you quite the major drama later.”</p><p>The charity auction continued.</p><p>Zhang Qingfeng naturally wouldn’t let the departure of Miao Jinlei to affect tonight’s charity gala. He continued the entire auction program for nearly an hour to completion.</p><p>It was then followed by the evening banquet in the next hall.</p><p>Zhang Yueming, Gu Changmin, and more than a dozen or so businesspeople who knew Tang Xiu came over to gather here and engaged in conversation. Zhang Qingfeng, who acted as the host, also pulled Tang Xiu and Mu Wanying to the innermost inside to take a seat at the main table.</p><p>The evening banquet was then concluded at eleven in the evening.</p><p>At the hotel entrance.</p><p>Tang Xiu parted ways with Zhang Yueming, Gu Changmin, and the other friends here as he watched all of them leaving. Then he immediately called Mo Awu to drive the car.</p><p>After taking a seat beside with Mu Wanying, Tang Xiu took out his mobile and asked with a smile on his face, “Do you still remember what I told you before? Be prepared to watch a major drama that I’m about to show you.”</p><p>“Yeah, I remember it!” Mu Wanying nodded and said, “Aren’t you going to call Miao Wentang?”</p><p>Tang Xiu let out a hollow laugh a few times and said, “Not really. I won’t only call him, but also turn his face red instantly. You can believe me or not, but once Miao Wentang picks up my call, he will definitely be furious and he will even kick his nephew out of the Miao Family.”</p><p>Mu Wanying shook her head and smiled tenderly, “I can believe you if you can make Miao Wentang give a severe lesson to Miao Jinlei. But I don’t think he will drive away Miao Jinlei from his family. It’s impossible since blood is thicker than water. Even if you do have a good relationship with Miao Wentang, I don’t think you can do a thing to a member of his household, no?”</p><p>“So you don’t believe it. Then just sit tight and see!” Tang Xiu let out an enigmatic smile.</p><p>With that said, he then called Miao Wentang’s cell number and waited for his call to be picked up.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
