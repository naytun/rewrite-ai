As long as he could cure his illness, even though it was not enough for Wang Tao to respectfully pay back his gratitude, it would also serve as extra points to the cause.</p><p>After diagnosing Wang Tao using Chinese medical art, Tang Xiu clearly figured out the guy’s symptoms. Something that was unexpected to him was that this guy turned out to have contracted a particular disease.</p><p>“Your kidney is kind of having a Yang energy deficiency. There should be symptoms of impotence and premature ejaculation.”</p><p>Tang Xiu loosened his hand and looked at Wang Tao with a pale smile.</p><p>An embarrassed look could be seen on Wang Tao’s face as he awkwardly rubbed his hands and asked, “You can only see these symptoms?”</p><p>“Of course, they’re not the only ones,” Tang Xiu shook his head and explained, “You have contracted an STD that is much more serious than normal genital viruses. Your member also begins to become inflamed and has purulent discharge, even ulceration. If you don’t treat it in time, you could become a eunuch and have your life threatened.”</p><p>Wang Tao’s expression whitened as he said, “You’re simply a God, Big Brother Tang. I never thought that a cultivator could actually have such deep knowledge in Chinese medicine. Your diagnosis is correct, I’ve been to several large hospitals and the results from their diagnosis are just like you told me. However, they are helpless in being able to cure the virus. I can only have a medication to suppress it, so I already planned to leave for Beijing to seek treatment. That is, after my family has conducted the opening sale ceremony for the Golden Goblet Emperor Gauze villa complex. I might have to seek treatment abroad should it fail.”</p><p>Tang Xiu secretly felt lucky since he came to Qinglin County in time. If he hadn’t, this guy would’ve really come to Beijing or overseas to seek treatment, making it difficult to find him.</p><p>“I can cure this disease.”</p><p>Wang Tao was overjoyed and said in a hurry, “If you really can cure my illness, I’ll pay anything, Big Brother Tang! You’ll be my great benefactor from now on.”</p><p>“I’m flattered for such heavy words. But the reason I came to Qingcheng Mountain is to repay a debt of gratitude. And since Wang Rui is your big brother, helping you is equal to paying it,” said Tang Xiu with a smile.</p><p>The words, however, made Wang Tao a bit awkward and embarrassed. “You’ve misunderstood something, Big Brother Tang. Wang Rui is not my biological brother. He’s the son of my uncle, my paternal cousin.”</p><p>Tang Xiu frowned intentionally and concealed his real feelings. Just as Wang Tao was anxious that Tang Xiu would take back his words and wanted to speak, Tang Xiu nodded and said, “I’ll still treat you, even if he’s not your real brother. To tell you the truth, I’ve felt like I can relate with you ever since we’ve met, so I’ll still cure you as long as you need treatment, regardless of your relationship with Wang Rui. As for the payment… the best one is as long as you can regard me as your friend.”</p><p>Feeling congenial? And becoming friends?</p><p>The words shook Wang Hao’s heart, as he didn’t expect that he had such a strong affinity with Tang Xiu. Even this Magnificent Tang Corp’s Big Boss felt that they hit it off the first time they met. How could such a big fortune fall on him?</p><p>“I also have another identity,” said Tang Xiu with a smile. “I’m a doctor at the Star City Chinese Medical Hospital. There has been quite a lot of coverage about me; you can find it if you browse the internet.”</p><p>A doctor from the Star City Chinese Medical Hospital?</p><p>Wang Tao felt a bit incredulous inside. How come such a dignified cultivator, as well as the Big Boss of the Magnificent Tang Corp., would work as a doctor in the hospital? He thought for a moment before he quickly took out his mobile and searched for ‘Star City Chinese Medical Hospital Doctors’. After a while, he saw a list of reports about the Star City Chinese Medical Hospital and most of the news was tagged with ‘the Young Divine Doctor Tang Xiu’.</p><p>“Real… it’s real?”</p><p>Wang Tao looked up and asked with a vacant expression, “Big Brother Tang… how exactly did you work as a doctor in a Chinese Medical Hospital… considering your identity?</p><p>“It’s true that I’m the owner of Magnificent Tang Corporation and am also a cultivator,” said Tang Xiu. “But to me, any profession has no distinction of status and rank, be it low or honored. I have the skills, so I must properly put them to use. I went to the Chinese Medical Hospital to render my services as a doctor in my spare time. There have been many patients, be it illness or injuries, that were cured by me. Just as a doctor, I’ve been able to save lives and rescue more and more people. So, Brother Wang Tao, don’t you think you’ll find delight and happiness by helping others at the same time?”</p><p>Wang Tao himself had been taught the saying of ‘taking pleasure of helping others’ since childhood, but he never intentionally helped others; nor did he ever feel happiness and delight in serving others at the same time.</p><p>Tang Xiu was as though sensing Wang Tao’s thoughts and continued again, “Truth be told, when I was in the hospital, I saw many patients who were about to die; injured people who were in pain, whining, and mourning. I especially saw the moments when they were in despair and frightened. And yet, I felt a sense of accomplishment when I reached out my hands to save them. You can imagine that there’s an injured person laying before you with bleeding wounds, and then you finally retain their lives. You then face them while they express their gratitude along with respect, affection, and praise; some of them even wish they could kowtow to express their thanks. Would you feel joy and happiness through such scenes?”</p><p>Scenes that depicted Tang Xiu’s words emerged inside Wang Tao’s mind as he fell into his imagination for a dozen seconds. He was then back to his senses with a gradually dissipating smile.</p><p>“It’s indeed a blissful and joyous scene.”</p><p>“Let me tell you another analogy,” said Tang Xiu with a smile. “I’ll be blissful when I’m capable to cure you since I feel that we can be friends. If you put yourself in my shoes and are also a doctor, then when you see your loved ones’ terminal illness and have to act to cure them, will you feel joyful and blissful?”</p><p>Tang Xiu’s words deeply touched Wang Tao’s heart. He never thought that Tang Xiu would be so affectionate as to liken himself to caring for relatives.</p><p>“We’re brothers; it’s said and done.” Wang Tao looked at Tang Xiu and solemnly said, “I will never say anything about paying you back anymore. Please help me treat my illness, Big Brother Tang, for you are my brother. Others might not dare to say that they will forsake their lives for the sake of their brothers, but I absolutely can do it.”</p><p>Tang Xiu laughed in a crisp voice and said, “Great. I’m really not mistaken about you. You’re a man of character.”</p><p>Immediately after, Tang Xiu took out a paper and quickly wrote a prescription. Then he handed it to Wang Tao and said, “Tell the men under you to get medicine according to this prescription. Remember, what you must buy are top quality medicinal herbs, these being wild herbs. I’ll start boiling the Chinese herbal medicine for you after you buy all of them, then apply it on the infected part of your body to remove the virus.”</p><p>After saying that, he wrote another prescription and gave it to Wang Tao again, “The medicinal herbs written here are as expensive as the previous ones. You can buy them for several hundred yuan. After you buy them, I’ll continue treating the torment you’ve been suffering. It’s medicine for your internal organs and will nourish your kidneys to treat the Yang deficiency symptoms. I dare not say anything else, but you can dramatically improve the quality of your sexual life as long as you take the medication a few times. Drinking it continually for a month will make you able to satisfy your woman repeatedly every night.”</p><p>“That would be great!” Wang Tao was ecstatic and his eyes were particularly blazing when he looked at Tang Xiu. Then he handed over the two prescriptions to the woman and told her to get the herbs personally. In the meantime, he boiled tea by himself and brought his best Cuban cigar out from abroad and personally served them for Tang Xiu.</p><p>“Big Brother Tang, you’ve come from far away place, so just stay here! We, brothers, are like old friends even at the first time we met. Besides, I also want to know more about you and get along well.”</p><p>“Might as well stay here even if we brothers still have plenty of time to meet in the future,” replied Tang Xiu with a smile. “Besides, I can’t go anywhere for the time being and gotta stay with you. I won’t go even if you want to drive me out!”</p><p>“But why?” Wang Tao didn’t have the slightest idea to drive Tang Xiu away, but the reply confused him and he curiously asked, “Are you staying here temporarily to wait for my brother?”</p><p>“Hey, didn’t you say it previously that your brother is being locked up to face the wall to reflect on his mistakes?” said Tang Xiu snappily. “How can I not stay here? I must stay here for some time to wait for your subordinate who’s buying those medicinal herbs to come back since I need to personally administer the herbal medicine for you.”</p><p>Wang Tao instantly came to his senses and said embarrassedly, “You see, my pig brain is kinda smart… but, well, every man has a fool up his sleeve, no? Anyways, we felt like old buddies at the first meeting today, Big Brother Tang. I’ll tell my people to prepare good wine and meals later today. Let’s get drunk before we part.”</p><p>“Nope. Just tea and meals for dinner.” Tang Xiu shook his head and said, “Forget alcohol.”</p><p>“Do you think the wine I’ll be preparing is not as good as your Magnificent Tang’s Gods Nectar, Brother Tang?” asked Wang Tao quickly. “I admit it’s not comparable to that wine indeed.”</p><p>“I gotta say you’re sometimes smart and yet stupid like a pig sometimes. I even feel that you love imagining things to entertain all sort of ideas,” commented Tang Xiu helplessly. “You wanna know why you mustn’t drink? It’s because you must drink that herbal medicine today. If you were to get drunk, how can you drink that medicine to treat your illness, huh?”</p><p>Wang Tao was instantly petrified and the color of his face turned into the shade of a baboon’s bottom. It took a long time before he could ease up from his embarrassment.</p><p>Outside the courtyard’s gate.</p><p>The female who just went out of the courtyard with the two herbal medicine prescriptions saw a Mercedes Benz business car coming from the distance. She was familiar with its plate number and instantly realized that her Big Boss was coming.</p><p>As expected, Wang Xuegan in a black suit opened its door and came out of the car. He looked at the female and asked, “Is Little Tao at home?”</p><p>“He is, Sir!” answered the female quickly.</p><p>Wang Xuegang nodded and was about to enter when he suddenly stopped and asked again, “What are you going to do?”</p><p>“A guest came to visit and young master Wang asked me to buy herbs according to the prescription wrote by that guest,” answered the female.</p><p>“Who’s this guest?” asked Wang Xuegang with a frown.</p><p>“I don’t know.” The female shook her head and said, “I wasn’t around when young master Wang was conversing with him.”</p><p>Wang Xuegang’s brows creased deeper and discontentedly said, “Show me that prescription!”</p><p>The female quickly handed the prescription to Wang Xuegang. She knew that her Big Boss had started from a barefoot doctor and his career had been rapidly promoted after he cured a certain big personage of his sickness due to coincidence.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
