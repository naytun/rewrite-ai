He looked at the vacant expressions on everyone’s faces and asked aloud, “Why do all of you have such an expression? Do you think that there’s no way Xiu is getting out of this place?”</p><p>Old Anji glanced at him and said, “Every prisoner being detained here is equal to a bird whose wings have been cut off, or a poisonous snake whose fangs have been broken and lost its freedom. Hence, Xiu is just making a joke. He won’t be able to go out this cell 18 to have some exercise or fresh air. As for another reason, that cell in front is cell 1. There’s only one path for those who enter it—death. Even the prison guards are no exception.</p><p>“No kidding. Is that cell holding some kind of monster or something?” asked Saptanshu incredulously.</p><p>“It’s not a monster,” replied Old Anji. “It’s a devil.”</p><p>Tang Xiu couldn’t help but laugh and said, “To tell you the truth, I may be afraid of some things, but never the devil. Hey, the two of you, open this cell door. I gotta go to cell no. 1 in front. I wanna see that devil.”</p><p>The two prison guards had received Sander’s order to allow Tang Xiu to move around in the prison, albeit only a small range. They exchanged words in a whisper for a short while before one of them took out the key and opened the prison cell door and said, “If that devil from cell 1 throws your corpse out, we’ll collect your dead body for you by then.”</p><p>Tang Xiu couldn’t help but smile. He headed out of the cell under the watchful eyes of the tongue-tied and dumbfounded others, then went straight to the door of the opposite cell.</p><p>Cell 1 was very large—at least 50 square meters in size. There was only one bed inside, a fancy and high-quality mattress. There were also a variety of home appliances inside that made it feel like a small room and not a prison cell.</p><p>Inside the cell now, Spectre was lying on the bed with a book covering his face. It was unknown whether he was asleep.</p><p>Tang Xiu walked forward to reach a chair and took it. He then directly took a seat two-plus meters away from the bed. He then crossed his legs before he picked up the half-pack of cigarettes and took one and ignited it. He shook his head after blowing out a cloud of smoke and said, “This cigarette is really disappointing and smells like shit.”</p><p>Spectre’s fingers moved but turned calm again shortly. However, a cold and detached voice came out from the book, “Smells like shit, huh? It can still make people know that they’re still alive. You had better cherish that cigarette smoke—nobody knows whether they can still puff out once more after one smoke.”</p><p>Tang Xiu couldn’t help but chuckle and said, “Why do I feel like that you’re not like the famous, legendary devil Spectre, but instead are a philosopher?”</p><p>Pa…</p><p>Spectre lifted his hand to raise the book and directly threw it to the side. Then he sat on the bed, leaned his head and folded his arms, and watched Tang Xiu. He said with a pale smile, “You’re very interesting, Monsieur. At least you dare come to my place alone—the only one who dares to do so in the last 5 years, so I don’t want to kill you now.”</p><p>“Well, it seems like I have quite the charming personality, don’t I?” Tang Xiu smiled.</p><p>Spectre’s complexion turned chilly as a stream of wind suddenly erupted between his fingers. The half-pack of cigarettes that Tang Xiu put on the table were wrapped by the stream of wind before appearing in his hands. He took one of them and lit it up. After taking in some puffs and blowing the smoke out, only then did Spectre inquire, “Let’s have a chat. Why did you come here?”</p><p>“I’m saving you and taking you out,” answered Tang Xiu.</p><p>As though he heard something extremely funny, Spectre burst into laughter, “Hahaha, that’s so fucking interesting. Someone wants to save me and take me out? Hahaha…”</p><p>“Is that a problem?” asked Tang Xiu.</p><p>Spectre looked at Tang Xiu as though he was looking at an idiot and smilingly said, “Do you really think that I can’t leave this place if I wanna go out?”</p><p>“You do have the ability to escape according to my men’s narrative about you.” Tang Xiu nodded and said, “I don’t know why you keep staying here, but I believe that you’ll end up following me. Also, I’m sure that you’ll continue to work under me in the future.”</p><p>Spectre squinted his eyes and suddenly swayed his arms as three sharp arrows made of wind shot at Tang Xiu’s eyes and mouth.</p><p>Tang Xiu just casually raised his hand and flicked his fingers, similarly releasing three streams of qi that shattered those wind arrows. Then he smiled and said, “I see, you turned out to be a Wind Elementalist, so you do have an ability to be proud of.”</p><p>Spectre’s countenance slightly changed. His body swayed and disappeared in a flash as his shadows revolved around Tang Xiu. The dense wind blades followed as the air suddenly turned dry and a bit hot as a purple-red flame appeared out of thin air and wrapped around the wind blades.</p><p>“Die…”</p><p>The blazing wind blade with purple flame overwhelmingly swept towards Tang Xiu.</p><p>Tang Xiu heavily punched his fist out. The overwhelming waves of qi spread out from his fist and formed a violent flux of energy which bombarded the blazing wind blades in the air. The steel chair Tang Xiu was sitting on fell apart, whereas Spectre’s bed also blasted into pieces while the violent energy flux came blasting into Spectre’s chest.</p><p>BOOM…</p><p>The reinforced concrete wall now had a hole in it. The two prisoners in the cell next to cell 1 were dumbfounded and slack-jawed as they saw Spectre getting blown away.</p><p>“I didn’t expect the quality of this wall to be this bad, though.” Tang Xiu shook his head while smiling.</p><p>Cough… cough…</p><p>Blood seeped out of the corners of Spectre’s mouth while his eyes were filled with a dignified look. He tightly stared at Tang Xiu and asked, “Who the hell are you, and where did you come from?”</p><p>“Spare the nonsense of where I come from, shall we?” Tang Xiu waved his hand and said, “We’ve come to visit these two gentlemen. You shall wait for me to pack them up and make them docile before I continue beating you up. Well, you two… should be Ammos and Ammosai, aren’t you? The two Fire Elementalists?”</p><p>Ammos and Ammonite exchanged glances and the former snorted and asked, “Who the fuck are you?”</p><p>“The law can’t sentence you to death, but I can easily kill you,” directly announced Tang Xiu. “So, I’ll give you a chance to submit to me and be my loyal men later. I can take you outside if you want, but if you don’t agree, I’ll torture you and make you suffer many days and nights before I kill you.”</p><p>“Fucking arrogant!”</p><p>Ammosai roared angrily and waved his hands as two fire serpents instantly appeared and wrapped around his arms. Layers of flame immediately hurled toward Tang Xiu as the two fire serpents blazed back and forth in an attempt to kill Tang Xiu.</p><p>“Exterminate!”</p><p>After Tang Xiu formed a seal, the fire in the surrounding air instantly disappeared. Ammosai’s face drastically changed as the flame and his fire serpents dissolved and vanished without a trace.</p><p>“Impossible!”</p><p>Ammosai desperately tried to sense the element of fire, but to his horror, he could no longer feel the least bit of fire energy. Being unable to sense the fire element energy meant that he couldn’t use his superpower at all.</p><p>Ammos could also sense it as well. He ended up like Ammosai—unable to sense the existence of the fire element at all. The strange situation struck him with horror and made him flustered. He stared tightly at Tang Xiu and fiercely shouted, “How the hell did you do it?”</p><p>“I can easily control the world’s energy as long as I want to use it,” Tang Xiu sneered. “If I don’t want to make them exist, not even Elementalists such as you can even think about using them. Now tell me, are you willing to submit to me?”</p><p>“That’s impossible,” shouted Ammos and Ammosai in unison.</p><p>Tang Xiu didn’t ask again and released a violent pressing aura. His figure instantly dashed in front of the duo as his lightning-like fists bombarded the two men one after another. They might be very powerful, but they had no powers left, leaving the duo unable to fight back the barrage of Tang Xiu’s strikes.</p><p>“Aaaargh… (Aaaargh)!”</p><p>Their shrill screams came spreading out from cell no. 2. All the prisoners and prison guards within 100 meters could hear them very clearly, yet none of these prison guards came rushing as they had been ordered from the top to ignore everything regardless of whatever the issue was.</p><p>Inside the prison monitoring room.</p><p>Sander stared fixedly at the surveillance screen, a look of horror on his face. Outsiders might be unaware of how powerful Ammos and Ammosai were, but he was crystal clear about the duo. These two brothers were second only to the most horrifying existence, Spectre; hence, they were detained in cell no. 2.</p><p>And yet, these two dreadful men were unexpectedly beaten by Tang Xiu and even screamed out miserably. This made him look at Tang Xiu through the surveillance screen like he was watching some freaking monster.</p><p>“Is this guy a damned devil or something, Warden? How can he be that powerful?” asked the prison guard with a shocked face.</p><p>Sander narrowed his eyes all of a sudden as he pulled out a sharp knife and stabbed the prison guard’s heart. The two guards behind him also moved in that instant and killed the other two in the surveillance room. In just a few seconds, they already killed all the three prison guards inside the room.</p><p>“Call our men to come here and keep this monitoring room under our control. No matter what happens in the surveillance footage, it can’t be known to outsiders,” ordered Sander with all seriousness.</p><p>“Understood!” The two prison guards immediately nodded.</p><p>Inside cell 2, Tang Xiu was still savagely beating Ammos and Ammosai and kept at it for several minutes more. Only after the duo was badly bruised and beaten did he finally stop and kick them to the corner. Then he asked coldly, “Now tell me, are you willing to pledge your loyalty to me in the future?”</p><p>“…”</p><p>The duo still didn’t answer because they didn’t want to serve under anyone else.</p><p>“If so, then I’ll keep beating you up,” Tang Xiu said. “Rest assured, though. You’ll be able to endure my beatings for a day and a night. Even if you two are made of steel, I’ll turn you into a steel juice. And by the way, I forgot to tell you—you won’t die even if I savagely beat you for days and nights. One of my identities is that of a powerful doctor.”</p><p>BAM… BAM…</p><p>As his voice faded away, Tang Xiu began the beating session again. He even used both his hands and feet. After several minutes he kicked the duo into cell 000001. But Spectre frowned deeply, tons of thoughts churning inside his mind as he watched Tang Xiu beating the two brothers Ammos and Ammosai.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
