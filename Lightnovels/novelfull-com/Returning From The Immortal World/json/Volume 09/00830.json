He didn’t have the slightest idea to find out about the Golden Shield Special Ability Bureau of the United States. He wasn’t, and never would be, a politician. His motive was just pure business; he wanted to make money to buy cultivation resources for his family members to become immortal cultivators in earnest.</p><p>Tang Guosheng respected and fully approved of Tang Xiu’s judgment at this time. He shook his head to express his opinion that they didn’t need to act like that and said directly, “Xiu’er has his own plan. Since he doesn’t want to leave anyone alive, we might as well annihilate them completely! Besides, I’m sure the US will stay low for a few years after the Golden Shield Special Ability Bureau suffers such a great loss.”</p><p>Having said that, their eyes shifted back to the virtual holographic screen to watch several American Golden Shield ability users unleash their abilities in an attempt to escape from where the cargo ship just exploded.</p><p>The beautiful woman was doing fine. She was a Water Elementalist and also seized the time to quickly grab a small boat while manipulating the water. Hence, she was able to drift over a kilometer away without serious injuries. Dorot, however, didn’t possess such a sharp sixth sense like the belle and reacted much slower. At this moment, his back was dyed red by his blood, with more seeping out from his lips. He desperately manipulated two flames and sprinted on the sea’s surface.</p><p>Bang, bang, bang…</p><p>Six explosion sounds came from behind them, causing the fleeing Dorot and the belle to look behind. Their complexions dramatically changed as they saw six members of their Special Ability Bureau being bombarded with artillery shells that streaked out from the water. Their bodies were blown up and turned into a bloody mist as they floated several meters in the air.</p><p>“What the fuck is going on, and what are those shits?”</p><p>Torn apart inside, Dorot felt like he was about to explode with fury. Unfortunately, no one could explain, not even the slightly injured belle.</p><p>Sanger Heyburn. A 48-year-old Water Elementalist and a member of the Golden Shield Special Ability Bureau. She was one of the five strongest ability users in the entire Golden Shield Special Ability Bureau and was also Dorot’s best general in battle.</p><p>At this time, her ability was just slightly affected even though she was lightly injured in the cargo ship’s explosion. She was practically like a fish in the water after submerging under the sea, manipulating the current of the water around her to constantly accelerate herself. Not even a supercar at max speed was faster than her speed in the water.</p><p>‘The sea is my world. I can still survive after staying in the sea for a few months. No matter what kind of weapons the enemy uses, nothing can threaten me as long as I’m in the sea,” imagined Sanger Heyburn.</p><p>Suddenly, a dreadful aura came, followed by buzzing sounds that traveled fast in the water. Two seconds after it caught up with her, she felt a tremendous force on her back. Her body burst apart and dyed the seawater red.</p><p>On the sea.</p><p>The pretty woman rowed the small boat and quickly appeared next to Dorot. Looking at the man’s miserable condition as he coughed up blood, she quickly shouted, “Come aboard. I’m faster than you at sea. I’ll take you and escape.”</p><p>The furious flame of anger in Dorot’s chess subsided considerably. He sprinted and jumped onto the small boat and straightly dispersed the flame he manipulated. After looking at the pretty woman whose injuries were light, he then ferociously looked back.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>He clearly saw that the last two members of the Golden Shield Special Ability Bureau were hit by artillery shells that flew out from the sea. Although the shells didn’t reduce them to ashes, it still directly blasted their bodies and killed him.</p><p>“Fucking bastards! Even with torpedoes or naval mines, it’s impossible to have such huge power, speed, and precision. What fucking weapon is that? Who the hell is attacking us?”</p><p>Dorot was truly maddened and tormented by the artillery shells that swiftly came out of nowhere like devils. He was forced to see one of his trained men blown up, causing his heart to ache.</p><p>“I’m sure it’s some devilish shit used by those Chinese,” said the belle in a cold voice. “There’s no one else in this area but those two Chinese liners. Dorot, we were likely ambushed by the Chinese. I can tell that there are Chinese submarines in the water.”</p><p>“CHINA?!” Dorot yelled furiously. “I already guessed it should be those damned Chinese. But this bunch of assholes was nearly destroyed by the hands of those French Special Ability Bureau Elementalists. How the fuck do they dare to shoot us? We were still so fucking far away from them, so how the hell did those fuckers find us?”</p><p>“Our eyes have undergone surgery that has greatly improved our eyesight. Do you think that no one among those Chinese also had undergone a similar surgery? On top of that, I don’t think those two liners are just ordinary liners. They must have been modified and had a military surveillance system installed. It’s easy to spot us with that kind of instrument. Just pipe down, will you? Things have already reached this point and its useless to get angry over it now. What’s more important now is to escape far away from here.”</p><p>Dorot took a deep breath to suppress his anger, then said with a grim face, “As long as I don’t die today, I’ll definitely make those Chinese fuckers pay a terrible price in the future. I’ll massacre their cities,—at the very least, I will slaughter a small town to vent my hatred!”</p><p>“You’re right. Only by slaughtering the Chinese citizens can we wash away our shame today—only by using their blood,” replied the pretty woman.</p><p>Suddenly, the pretty woman shuddered. Two water columns appeared from both sides of the small boat in almost an instant, wrapping her body in a flash to forcefully move her dozens of meters away.</p><p>“BOOM…”</p><p>The small boat was hit by an artillery shell. Dorot, who was unable to detect it ahead of time, was instantly hit and he fainted in the flame of the explosion. His body was still intact, but his internal organs were shattered by the impact of the explosion. Unless there was a magical pill refined by a Perfected Golden Immortal, nothing could take him away from death.</p><p>“DOROT!”</p><p>The belle was full of sorrow. She didn’t have much of a sense of belonging to the Golden Shield Special Ability Bureau, but Dorot was different. He was the reason why she enlisted to join the bureau. It was not like a sentiment between a couple, rather it was comradeship from when they had gone through a lot together.</p><p>At this time, she was completely infuriated. Dorot, one of a handful of friends she trusted the most, was killed like this.</p><p>“DAMN CHINESE PEOPLE! I’LL MAKE YOU PAY WITH YOUR BLOOD SOONER OR LATER!”</p><p>The pretty woman furiously roared as she manipulated the water dragon to wrap her body. It took her away with speed faster than before.</p><p>Shoo! Shoo!</p><p>Two half-a-meter-long artillery shells completely locked onto the pretty woman mid-air. She cursed for a few seconds before the two shells bombarded her.</p><p>Inside the Subaquatic Corvette, Tang Xiu calmly watched the pretty woman being killed by the two shells. The coldness in his eyes gradually subsided as he turned to look at Tang Guosheng and said, “Grandpa, I still need to stay at sea for two days. You must have alarmed a lot of people since you took a lot of our family’s manpower to come here without telling anyone why. Also, we have killed the French and American ability users, so I’m sure the news of their death will reach the people of these two countries. You must take back our family’s men and leave here as quick as possible to return to our country.”</p><p>Tang Guosheng asked, “The fact that we killed these two countries’ ability users, should we disclose it, say, to those above…”</p><p>“No. It’s best not to tell them directly.” Tang Xiu shook his head and said, “Duanmu Lin should be their spokesman. Just inform Duanmu Lin directly. I believe he will not only solve the following problems but will also erase all traces. He may even become very excited since… well, it’s a kind of a present we are giving to him!”</p><p>Tang Guosheng’s eyes lit up and he nodded with satisfaction. “You’re right. Let’s do it this way, then. Also, pay attention to your safety after we leave, got it? You must stay alive no matter what.”</p><p>“Don’t worry, grandpa!” Tang Xiu nodded. “I would never make any stupid mistakes.”</p><p>After a long while, Tang Xiu sent Tang Guosheng and Tang Min back to the liner. He then watched the two ships disappear into the distance and over the horizon. Then he turned to look at Gu Xiaoxue and said, “You know, I used to feel a sliver of a sense of belonging to a family in the past, and the one who gave me that feeling is only your Master. But now that I have more family members, it turns out that such a feeling is really great.”</p><p>An envious look flashed in Gu Xiaoxue’s eyes. She was an orphan. She didn’t know who her parents were, not even if they were dead or alive. However, she couldn’t care less about that, for who she cared about was her Master, Gu Yan’er. “Family” to her was limited to her Master and the core members of the Everlasting Feast Hall.</p><p>“The feeling of… kinship? A sense of belonging to a family?”</p><p>Suddenly, Gu Xiaoxue’s expression slightly changed and she asked, “Grand Master, do you only regard Master as a family member?”</p><p>“Being a Master for a day is a father for life,” answered Tang Xiu with a smile. “If she’s not my family member, then who is?”</p><p>Suddenly, Gu Xiaoxue’s heart ached as the complex emotions inside her were in a frenzy. She didn’t know if it was because she felt sorry for her Master or if it was because of other reasons.</p><p>In the next two days, Tang Xiu took Cheng Xuemei and Gu Xiaoxue back to the previous barren island that they visited and he continued to train Cheng Xuemei. After a few days of training, Cheng Xuemei was finally able to control her own power, and she even learned an immortal cultivation technique from Tang Xiu.</p><p>Having tasted what cultivation, she was so fascinated that she even found herself addicted to it. Unfortunately, Tang Xiu didn’t have much time to delay and told her that the training time for her was up, much to her chagrin.</p><p>“Then what I should do next?” asked Cheng Xuemei, looking a bit worried.</p><p>“I know what you’re worried about. You’re still on a mission, after all, and the people in Japan probably think that you’ve died inside the vestige, so you’ll be questioned if you go back,” said Tang Xiu. “But you can rest assured about that. I’ll help you figure out a way to deal with it properly.”</p><p>“You mean… I can still return to Japan and continue my mission?” asked Cheng Xuemei, surprised.</p><p>“Of course, you can,” answered Tang Xiu with a smile. “I’ve told Kuwako to arrange things to cover you up. She’ll even help you in the future, so you naturally won’t have to ditch your mission like that.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
