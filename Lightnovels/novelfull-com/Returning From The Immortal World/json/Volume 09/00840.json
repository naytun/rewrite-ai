He had encountered many strong enemies in his multiple decade assassination career—even some he had to flee from. However, the handsome Oriental youth before him right now had a terrifying strength that sent chills and dread down to his heart.</p><p>‘He’s too strong.’</p><p>He was perfectly aware of the strength possessed by the two brothers, Ammos and Ammosai. Defeating the duo would never be an easy feat for him, let alone doing it so easily like Tang Xiu.</p><p>Suddenly, Tang Xiu, who had been beating Ammos and Ammosai brothers, turned to look at Spectre and asked, “Do you think this kind of beating is meaningless?”</p><p>“I find it meaningless indeed,” indifferently replied Spectre with squinted eyes.</p><p>Tang Xiu smiled and raised his hands to the front of his eyes. Then he turned his palms upward as two glittering blue crystals sudden emerged above, making Ammos and Ammosai feel a sense of foreboding as Tang Xiu penetrated the blue crystals into their bodies.</p><p>“AAARGH…”</p><p>Tragic screams burst out from their mouths. Their bodies stiffened in that instant, and they suddenly curled and rolled up on the floor with their bodies violently convulsing. Their facial features distorted while their green veins on their forehead bulged out and all the blood vessels inside their bodies suddenly rebelled. The agonizing pain made the duo feel that death was much better than being alive for the first time.</p><p>Tang Xiu turned to look at Spectre and said with a pale smile, “Since I’ve come here, you only have to remember one thing—that those who follow me will prosper and those who are against me will vanish. It’s better to go out with me than stay in this dark prison or constantly wander around.”</p><p>Spectre backtracked two steps, but the dread and solemnity on his face suddenly turned into a smile as he said, “If my guess is correct, you should be a Chinese, am I right? I’ve studied the culture of your country and read a certain sentence in a book that said people might be somewhere while longing to be somewhere else. Hopefully I didn’t misuse idiom. But how are you going to solve this problem? Also, this is the act of punishing others to warn the rest, isn’t it? It won’t work on me, unfortunately. Even if I can’t beat you, I don’t think you can stop me from escaping either.”</p><p>“You’re overestimating your abilities, you know that?” said Tang Xiu indifferently while flipping his hand to take out a jade bottle. “Even if you grow wings, you can never escape from the palm of my hand if I want it so. Try it if you don’t believe me.”</p><p>“I’ll give you a chance, then. I’ll leave this place with you and go outside to work for you if you can catch me,” sneered Spectre.</p><p>Having said that, his hand instantly slashed the steel door at the speed of lightning as his figure dashed forward like a lightning bolt.</p><p>“Spirit Order Art.”</p><p>Tang Xiu activated a seal as hazy energy instantly shot toward the back of Spectre. His body, which was about to rush out of the door, suddenly stiffened. At the same time, Tang Xiu quickly took out four array disks from the interspatial ring and swiftly arranged the Four Divisions Array to trap Spectre inside.</p><p>“BREAK!”</p><p>Spectre roared furiously and his complexion flushed red. The energy inside his body violently burst out to shatter that special energy inside his body, restoring his rigid body to normal. He complacently laughed inwardly and continued his sprint to the door.</p><p>BAM…</p><p>An invisible shield of energy blocked him. The force of the huge impact caused the energy shield in front of him to sway and ripple as his body was bouncing backward. Yet, his back then touched an energy shield again; he had rebounded and slammed into the floor.</p><p>“What the hell is this thing?”</p><p>The pride and complacency inside his heart were diluted by cold bitter water. After bouncing up from the floor in the blink of an eye, he turned to look at Tang Xiu with disbelief on his face.</p><p>“An array formation,” answered Tang Xiu calmly.</p><p>“You’re a Chinese ascetic? Daoist cultivator?” Spectre exclaimed perplexedly. “I’ll be damned. Why on Earth would a dignified cultivator have so much free time to do such trivial things like this? Exactly why are you coming to this prison for?”</p><p>“I can tell you about if you wanna know.” Tang Xiu let out a pale smile and said, “But you won’t have any leeway to run away or move once you learn about it. Submit to me and you’ll live; disobey me, and you’ll die a tragic death.”</p><p>Spectre gripped his fists and looked like he was struggling. Only after a long while did he finally shout, “Tell me then.”</p><p>“I want to form an army of cultivators, so I need a lot of strong people who can charge and shatter the enemy lines for me. The purpose of my visit to labor camp 1319 is to purchase a large number of prisoners. You can say that I’m recycling some trashes here,” said Tang Xiu with a pale smile</p><p>“No fucking way I’m some waste,” angrily roared Spectre, despite the horror inside him upon hearing Tang Xiu’s objective.</p><p>“You’re nothing but garbage in my eyes,” sneered Tang Xiu. “Don’t think that you’re worthy of being hailed as the strongest hitman in the assassin world, even if you’re a dual attribute Elementalist. You’re nothing but a cockroach in my eyes; killing you is as easy as pinching an ant. Also, I’ll tell you another thing. Some of my men who came with me this time are much stronger than you. They can easily obliterate you even if I don’t act personally.”</p><p>“Are they also cultivators?” asked Spectre.</p><p>“They are,” answered Tang Xiu.</p><p>Spectre was speechless, and the anger on his face slowly subsided. He then turned to look at Ammos and Ammosai twitching on the floor, and said desperately, “I’ll agree to follow you, but I also know a Chinese saying that an Emperor never lacks hungry soldiers. What benefits can you give me?”</p><p>The jade bottle in Tang Xiu’s hands instantly entered the Four Divisions Array and floated in front of Spectre as he slowly said, “There are two medicinal pills inside this. You can increase your strength, even if you only take one of them. Of course, you’ll have to learn an Immortal cultivation technique before you can take these medicinal pills. But I’ll teach you a set of Immortal cultivation techniques and turn you into an immortal cultivator.”</p><p>“I can also become an immortal cultivator?” Spectre stared at Tang Xiu dumbfoundedly with disbelief in his eyes.</p><p>“Nothing is impossible in my eyes.” Tang Xiu nodded and continued, “Once you become an immortal cultivator and work hard in your cultivation, with the aid of medicinal pills, let alone just surpassing your current strength, it won’t be a problem for you to reach the state where you are 10 million times more powerful than currently.”</p><p>“I agree!” said Spectre with excitement.</p><p>He might be a prisoner here, but his identity in this prison was very special—even the highest-ranking official in this prison wouldn’t dare to offend him. Thus, he could leave this place easily if he wanted to do so, despite him being guilty of his crime and sentenced here. Even if he didn’t want to be detained here, there were only a few people in the world who could catch him.</p><p>Hence, that was why he was angry and unwilling to be intimidated! Yet, being tempted with such benefits gave him ecstasy.</p><p>He was never short on money, nor was he lacking in glory over the years. He had his own way to earn if he so wished to, and he had countless women if he wanted them. But today, the desire of becoming stronger filled his heart. Despite being coerced right now, he was given a chance at a great opportunity.</p><p>“I… We agree too.”</p><p>Ammos’s distorted complexion, who was still convulsing on the floor, suddenly lifted, as he difficulty squeezed out those words that stiffly came out of his throat. Although Ammosai didn’t speak, he also chose to agree.</p><p>Tang Xiu smiled lightly in response and waved to retract back the two blue crystals. After the two brothers gradually recovered and calmed down, he removed the Four Divisions Array that trapped Spectre inside. Then he turned back to sit on the previous chair said, “I already read all the information on you all. The three of you should be the strongest inmates in labor camp in 1319. However, what I want to build is an army of cultivators and I’ll need a lot of men. The objective of my arrival to Tel Aviv this time is to bring out at least 100 prisoners with decent strength from this place.”</p><p>“Over 100 men?” Spectre was astounded and perplexedly said, “Do you perhaps want to cause a prison break?”</p><p>“Not really. I’ve always believed that things that can be solved with money never require the use of violence and force.” Tang Xiu shook his head. “Besides, my arrival here is a very secretive issue, so I don’t want any outsiders to investigate it. So, I’ll just have to spend some money to buy you out.”</p><p>“That’s impossible!” Spectre shook his head and said, “Even if Augustino values money like his life, he wouldn’t dare to sell so many convicts at the same time.”</p><p>“He wouldn’t dare indeed, but that’s not true of Gus Gilles and Sander.” Tang Xiu sneered, “As long as the criminal charge of selling prisoners is placed on Augustino, Sander’s official position will not only increase, but he and Gus Gilles can also earn a huge fortune.”</p><p>“Is this your plan?” asked Spectre while squinting his eyes.</p><p>“That’s right.” Tang Xiu nodded.</p><p>“There are a lot of ability users around Augustino from what I’ve found out.” Spectre shook his head and said, “He’s also quite a powerful man himself. Although he’s a bit weaker than me, not many can stand up to fight him. You will first need to kill that Augustino fellow. But since I already chose to follow you, I’ll eliminate those ability users around him!”</p><p>“I’ll send two people to help you later since he’s a tough guy,” said Tang Xiu indifferently. “As for our next move, I still need to stay in this prison to secretly pick the prisoners worthy of my purchase. You three can tell me if you have suggestions or those who you can recommend.”</p><p>“Alright.” Spectre nodded.</p><p>The two brothers, Ammos and Ammosai, exchanged glances and nodded in unison. They had just suffered from inhuman torture and were heavily injured at this time, so they were self-aware of their condition and didn’t promise to help solve the ability users around Augustino.</p><p>Tang Xiu took out two Holy Healing pills and threw them to the brothers and said, “Take these and your injuries will recover in a short time. Also, I’ll grant you each another medicinal pill, but you’ll take that pill after you learn a set of Immortal cultivation techniques from me in the future!”</p><p>“Thank you…”</p><p>“Call me Boss starting today onward,” said Tang Xiu.</p><p>“Thank you, Boss,” said the duo again.</p><p>Tang Xiu lightly smiled. However, he did not feel relieved to accept them like this, so he demanded the three men not to resist as he cast a Restriction Art seal on their bodies and fully controlled their lives.</p><p>At this time, hundreds of prisoners in nearby cells had heard the noises from the cell no. 1. Although many of them were secretly surprised that someone would provoke that fiendish devil inside that cell, none of them actually moved to take a look.</p><p>However, the five people in the opposite cell no. 18 knew that the one who entered the cell was Tang Xiu. But what shocked them the most was that the screams were not from Tang Xiu, but the two brothers in the cell no. 2.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
