Hence, he still wore a respectful attitude and replied modestly, “Brother Zhao is kidding me; I’m nothing but a small businessman, still very far from you. But still, I’m very grateful that you could honor me in taking time out of your busy schedule to join us. Anyhow, the tea has been served in the VIP room, so shall we head there and have a chat?”</p><p>“Alright,” said Zhang Xueming with a smile.</p><p>After the two men were done with the pleasantries and came to the VIP room, Zhao Xianming asked with a smile, “You’ve created such a big scene for the opening sale ceremony of your Golden Goblet Emperor Gauze Complex Villa, Brother Wang! I met some business owners when I just came here and I heard that you also spent quite a sum to invite the big star Zhang Xinya, didn’t you?”</p><p>“Yeah, they are some friends I’ve invited and came to give me face, Brother,” said Wang Xuegang with a smile. “As for Zhang Xinya, I did invite her to Qinglin County to ask her to sing at the opening ceremony.”</p><p>“That’s quite amazing, Brother Wang!” Zhao Xianming squinted his eyes and sighed, “My company held a welcome party for our new blood last year and I tried to invite her to perform at the event with quite a large amount of money. It was a pity that she refused the invitation. I really can’t compare with you in this regard!”</p><p>‘Compare my ass…’ cursed Wang Xuegan inwardly. He had known Zhao Xianming for many years. This fellow was rich and all but very stingy and a miser in nature. It was surely that the contract fee he offered for Zhang Xinya was so low that it would be strange for her to come.</p><p>Whereas he had spent literally millions for this occasion. He had got all the help could muster from his network before he was successful in inviting Zhang Xinya.</p><p>After the small chit-chat of pleasantries, the door was knocked and Wang Xuegang’s middle-aged female secretary entered and reported in a low voice, “Boss, young master Wang has just come along with Mr. Tang and the superstar Zhang Xinya.”</p><p>Wang Xuegang’s expression moved. It was rather normal for his son to come along with Tang Xiu since they were acquaintances, but how come Zhang Xinya came with them?</p><p>As he thought up to there, he then looked at Zhao Xianming and smilingly said, “I’ll have to excuse myself, Brother Zhao. I need to go to receive some guests and I’ll introduce you to a great personage later.”</p><p>Zhao Xianming blankly stared and stopped Wang Xuegang as he asked, “You’re just piquing my interest, so don’t leave me dry,, Brother Wang? Who exactly is this great man?”</p><p>“Soon, Brother Zhao. You’ll know about him soon,” immediately replied Wang Xuegang with a mysterious smile.</p><p>Having said that, he quickly left with the middle-aged female secretary. Just as he walked to the staircase, he saw Tang Xiu and Zhang Xinya come upstairs along with his son, Wang Tao.</p><p>“Boss Tang, Miss Zhang. You two seem to have already known each other from your mannerisms,” greeted Wang Xuegang with a smile.</p><p>“We have indeed known each other for some time, though we didn’t expect to meet in Qinglin County,” said Tang Xiu.</p><p>Wang Xuegang quickly understood and smilingly said, “Since you already know each other, it will save me from introducing you two to each other. I’ll take the honor to escort you to the VIP lounge so you two can have some rest. The ceremony is in about 30 minutes and I will depend on you both later.”</p><p>“Well, I’m just attending to have some fun, Boss Wang,” said Tang Xiu. “There’s no need for you to say that I will help you with the event, no? Besides, it’s Xinya who’ll sing, so there’s no need for me to get involved.”</p><p>“Well, I still have to make money for you, Boss. So, there’s nothing I can do but tire myself out,” interjected Zhang Xinyue with a smile.</p><p>Boss?</p><p>Wang Xuegang blanked out with disbelief in his eyes and asked with a surprised yet amazed expression, “Miss Zhang, you just said that… Boss Tang is your company’s…”</p><p>“… small shareholder,” interjected Tang Xiu quickly. “A friend of mine invited me a while back, and I was kinda unable to refuse him regarding investing some money. Don’t listen to her joke, Boss Wang.”</p><p>Wang Xuegang shivered inside a few times. Although Tang Xiu’s comment was light, he knew the people, including their background, of who established the entertainment company where Zhang Xinya worked under. Yet… it was unexpected that Tang Xiu and these people were friends. Friends enough that they were able to drag this young man out to invest some of his money, meaning that they must have a very good relationship.</p><p>‘…Maybe, Tang Xiu also has an official background.’</p><p>The thought crossed Wang Xuegang’s mind. His face suddenly beamed with a smile and he exclaimed, “You’re young and yet very promising, Boss Tang! I just hope that you can give guidance and help to my son since you two are friends.”</p><p>“It’s only natural for friends to help each other out.” Tang Xiu nodded.</p><p>After some perfunctory pleasantries, they came to the VIP lounge. As the tea and dessert were delivered, Wang Xuegang smilingly said, “Please have a chat here, ladies and gentlemen. I still need to greet other guests. Tao, serve Mr. Tang and Miss Zhang with the best hospitality and be sure to satisfy all their needs.”</p><p>“I understand, Father,” replied Wang Tao as he quickly glanced at Zhang Xinya.</p><p>Time flew by quickly, and the opening sale ceremony finally arrived. Zhang Xinyue, who was now the host and the guest star who would sing in the event to replace her older sister, Zhang Xinya, was cheered by the jam-packed crowd as she came to the entrance of the sales center. It was literally the effect of a superstar as there were at least several thousands of people coming here.</p><p>Zhang Xinyue was not her sister, Zhang Xinya, yet she didn’t look to be anxious in the slightest and took the microphone with a smile. “Welcome everyone…”</p><p>After her speech, Zhang Xinyue handed the mic to Wang Xuegang next to her. As the owner and developer of the Golden Goblet Emperor Gauze villa complex, he began his speech, “Well, I shall not repeat what Miss Xinya just said, everyone. But I’d like to convey my gratitude for the support you all have given. Also, I especially would like to introduce the distinguished guests who have honored us with their presence. Next to me is the deputy mayor of the city…”</p><p>“This one is the owner of Auspicious Gold Group, Zhao Xianming, from our city…”</p><p>“This is the county official, the Chief of Economic Development of our Qinglin County…”</p><p>“… and finally, I’d like to introduce you to a very distinguished guest we have here…”</p><p>As Wang Xuegang spoke up to there, he immediately made a pause to make everyone guess; yet, at this moment, the several thousands of people were surprised since they could tell that this special VIP was probably extraordinary from Wang Xuegang’s expression alone. Even Zhao Xianming, as well as the city officials and the deputy mayor, were somewhat surprised.</p><p>Wang Xuegang walked to the very edge of the line and came to Tang Xiu. He amicably pulled Tang Xiu back to the place where he just stood and excitedly said, “This man is a guest from afar, the owner of the very famous Magnificent Tang Corporation, Mr. Tang. He also has another identity as the kind-hearted and highly skilled miracle-working doctor: the young divine doctor, Tang Xiu.”</p><p>Tang Xiu?</p><p>In that instant, a burst of exclamation came from the crowd, including a surprise from the deputy mayor and Zhao Xianming. The reputation of Magnificent Tang Corporation was growing more resounding each day. It was at the point that they were known to everyone in the country. To think that its Big Boss, a great personage, turned out to have come here! It was very unexpected!</p><p>More so than that, nearly everyone presented here had heard about this young divine doctor, Tang Xiu, a figure who had been the hot topic of major media for years and even won the respect of countless people.</p><p>“Oh my God! I didn’t expect that Tang Xiu, the young divine doctor of the Star City Chinese Medical Hospital, is unexpectedly the owner of Magnificent Tang Corporation. The richest family of Qinglin County is truly worth the name; to think they can achieve such an amazing feat like inviting a great celebrity like Divine Doctor Tang to come here!”</p><p>“This is big news! My life can be considered to not be in vain since I was able to see such a revered and honorable guru.”</p><p>“I’m so fortunate to come here today; else, how could I possibly be able to see such an amazing great man!”</p><p>“This is truly inspiring! I never expected that the Big Boss of Magnificent Tang Corporation is so young, and yet is also the famous young divine doctor of Chinese medicine. He’s my idol, you know!”</p><p>“Amazing…”</p><p>“…”</p><p>Tang Xiu could only force a wry smile inwardly as he saw the excited faces below the stage. He came here for the Red Silk Flower and he must show his face in public yet again. Both of his identities were even introduced at the same time. This literally barred him from staying low-key even though he wanted to.</p><p>“Alright, for the next part. I invite Boss Tang to have a speech for us here,” said Wang Xuegang smilingly.</p><p>“Boss Wang, isn’t this out of the line with rules?” said Tang Xiu quickly, “Besides, there are city leaders, county officials, and distinguished people from the business community here. For me to speak here is just rather…”</p><p>Zhao Xianming was the local’s richest and most powerful man and was a very proud man to the bone. Only a handful of people he could see eye to eye with and took a liking to only a few. But he was actually a genuine admirer of Tang Xiu. Not only was it because Tang Xiu was the owner of Magnificent Tang Corp., but also due to his achievements in Chinese medicine.</p><p>Therefore, Zhao Xianming took a step forward and said with a beaming smile, “You’ve come from afar, Boss Tang, so you are our most honored guest. If you’re not qualified to say a few words, I’m afraid none of us here dare to speak.”</p><p>Tang Xiu smiled and shook his head. “Ah, you’re Boss Zhao! Since you said so, then I’ll borrow some great courage to speak a few words. I feel very fortunate to be able to attend the opening sale ceremony of the Golden Goblet Emperor Gauze villa complex since I’ve been given a chance to get acquainted with these many friends. I’m very happy myself and while speaking here, I would like to say my sincere wish that the opening ceremony of this villa complex will result in complete success. I hope the villas here will be very popular and be liked by everybody here and you are interested in buying them. That’s all I can say; thank you.”</p><p>Wang Xuegang received the microphone Tang Xiu handed him and said with excitement, “With the auspicious words from Mr. Tang, I’m now announcing that the Golden Goblet Emperor Goble villa complex is now open for public purchase. We are pleased to invite all the friends and guests who are interested in buying the villa of their choice to visit our sales center. Also, I’d like to invite all the guests who ordered a villa in the morning to come to attend the lunch banquet we’ll be holding at 12 o’clock. There we will appreciate the passionate songs that will be sung by our famous star singer, Miss Zhang Xinya.”</p><p>Shortly after, Wang Xuegang and everyone else came back from the sales center to the VIP lounge building. A lot of people came to visit Tang Xiu because of the exposure of his identity, causing him to exchange greetings with them. After which, he quietly slipped away to the roof with Wang Tao and seized his chance to have leisure time.</p><p>“Your father is truly excellent at business,” said Tang Xiu after he lit up a cigarette and sat cross-legged on the roof smoking.</p><p>“However excellent his business wisdom is, he can’t be compared to you, Big Brother Tang,” replied Wang Tao with a smile. “You know, the name of your company, Magnificent Tang Corporation, is like a blasting thunder that resounded in everyone’s ears, including me. You also saw how fast my Dad changed his expression and attitude the moment he learned of your identity, right?”</p><p>“Hehe!” Tang Xiu responded with a chuckle.</p><p>The two men chatted for a long time afterward. Only when the time denoted 12 sharp in the afternoon did they finally come down from the roof and go to the hall provided for the lunch feast.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
