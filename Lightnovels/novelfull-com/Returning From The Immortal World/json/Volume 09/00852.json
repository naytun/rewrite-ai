After seeing that the road ahead was almost paved, Tang Xiu intentionally wore a surprised look and asked, “I need a Millennium Wild Ginseng and a Red Silk Flower. Can you help me find them, Wang Tao?”</p><p>Wang Tao stared blankly for a while as he patted the back of his head all of a sudden and forced a smile, “Had you come half a month earlier, I could have put them before you in just a minute, Big Brother Tang. But now… I can only take out the Millennium Wild Ginseng since I already gave the Red Silk Flower to my uncle.”</p><p>“What?” Tang Xiu’s expression changed and he looked deeply disappointed.</p><p>He literally traversed thousands of miles to Qingcheng Mountain just to get the Red Silk Flower from Wang Tao. But the latter turned out to have given the flower to his uncle—the Vice Abbot of Qingcheng Daoist Monastery—half a month ago, which made him feel helpless inside.</p><p>Wang Tao’s expression suddenly moved, and he quickly said, “Big Brother Tang, I can accompany you to Qingcheng Monastery to find my uncle if you really need that Red Silk Flower. Although I heard that he also needs that flower as it seems to be related to the configuration of the medicine. Half a month ago, he still had several precious herbs, so the Red Silk Flower shouldn’t be used up by now.”</p><p>“How about going there now?” asked Tang Xiu immediately. “I don’t wanna delay it any longer.”</p><p>Seeing how anxious Tang Xiu was, Wang Tao laughed inwardly. He actually had another intention out of his selfishness to personally bring Tang Xiu to Qingcheng Monastery. Not only did he want to show his goodwill to Tang Xiu, but he also wanted to let his uncle know that he was the one who sent that Red Silk Flower. That flower should be a very good object if such a mighty cultivator like Tang Xiu seemed to be hell-bent on obtaining it.</p><p>“How about waiting until the day after tomorrow, Big Brother Tang? You see, I still have to take the herbal medicine medication, while I also must participate in the opening sale ceremony of my family’s Golden Goblet Emperor Gauze villa complex. If you could wait for me, we’ll immediately leave for the mountain right after the opening ceremony.”</p><p>Tang Xiu thought it over and silently nodded. He didn’t know the location of the Qingcheng Monastery, so it was better to wait for Wang Tao for two days to take him there instead of entering the vast mountain without knowing where it was. Yet, he could see the obvious intention of Wang Tao’s words, hoping that he could attend the opening sale ceremony of his family’s villa complex.</p><p>‘This really gives me a headache!’</p><p>Tang Xiu was keenly aware of the smug joyful light gleaming in Wang Tao’s eyes. He forced a wry smile and said, “So, where will the opening sale ceremony of your Golden Goblet Emperor Gauze villa complex be held? I’ll be attending on time the day after tomorrow.”</p><p>At the side, similar excitement could be seen hanging on Wang Xuegang’s face. He might have a big enterprise and be honored as the Qinglin County’s local tycoon due to his wealth and importance, but the compared to some large companies in China, it’s like the difference between day and night! The Magnificent Tang Corporation may have been established less than a year ago, but he knew that this company was very large and has been developing like a soaring rocket.</p><p>A few months ago, the said company had acquired a very large plot of land in Shanghai and also held a tender for construction companies all over the country. His construction company was not qualified to attend the tender; the rumors were that only the first top 10 of domestic construction companies were eligible for bidding.</p><p>Wang Xuegang thought that he was already rich, but compared to this person before him, the gap was like a chasm. Though the Magnificent Tang Corp. had long been valued to have industries worth no less than 10 billion yuan, it was still unknown whether it also included the other invisible wealth Tang Xiu might have.</p><p>If he could invite Tang Xiu to attend the opening sale ceremony of the Golden Goblet Emperor Gauze villa complex, it would definitely cause a huge sensation in the real estate industry, even the entire business community. That would lead to his company’s reputation to soar and would smooth out the path of development in the future.</p><p>Senbao 5-star hotel.</p><p>Inside the presidential suite 1208, Long Zhenglin rested comfortably on the sofa, imagining the scenes of Tang Xiu getting shut out by Wang Tao when he visited that guy, a frenzied smile appearing on his rough face.</p><p>“Ding… dong!”</p><p>The doorbell sounded and Long Zhenglin lackadaisically glanced at the door. He immediately waved to Jin Shi, who was sitting cross-legged in cultivation, and said in a weak voice, “Could you please open the door? Your Boss might have come back and found the door locked.”</p><p>Jin Shi just let out a hollow smile in response to his words and headed to the door. If someone else spoke these words to him, he would’ve definitely slapped that person, but Long Zhenglin was an exception. This guy had a very close relationship with his Boss, so Jin Shi didn’t dare to offend him.</p><p>“Huh? It’s you?” as Jin Shi opened the door and looked at the slim yet graceful Zhang Xinya with her excited face, he couldn’t help but exclaim.</p><p>Zhang Xinya herself had seen Jin Shi, so she instantly affirmed that Tang Xiu had come to Qinglin City. She was a bit absent-minded at this moment, yet she was very excited inwardly and quickly asked, “Is Tang Xiu here? I wanna see him.”</p><p>“Boss is not here. He’s currently outside tending to some things,” answered Jin Shi.</p><p>Zhang Xinya took a deep breath and directly squeezed herself into the room. A disappointed look flashed in her eyes when he saw that the man nested in the sofa was actually Long Zhenglin. Then she asked again, “Where he could possibly go to?”</p><p>“I don’t know the whereabouts of my Boss,” said Jin Shi. “He only ordered Awu to follow him to deal with some matters and told the rest of us to say here and wait for him.”</p><p>Zhang Xinya was silent for a short while before she took out her mobile to dial Tang Xiu’s cell number. This time, it only ran a few times before her call got picked up.</p><p>“Where are you, Tang Xiu?”</p><p>“Qingcheng Mountain, Qinglin County.”</p><p>Zhang Xinya couldn’t help but feel happy inwardly. She used to call Tang Xiu, but she could also sense the obvious rejection expressed by Tang Xiu. But now, he didn’t even lie to her and directly told her where he was.</p><p>“I’m also in Qinglin County and am staying in the presidential suite of the Senbao 5-star hotel—the same lodging as you. Your men told me that you’re outside tending to some things, so I won’t bother you. But I’ll be waiting for you here.”</p><p>Having said that, she directly hung up the phone, seemingly afraid that Tang Xiu would flatly refuse her.</p><p>Long Zhenglin got up from the sofa to look at Zhang Xinya with a strange expression covering his face, “You know, if anyone outside knew that the big star Zhang Xinya is actually waiting for a man in a hotel, I’ll be damned if none of the men in the world will be jealous of him, no? You like my Big Bro, don’t you?”</p><p>“I do. I like Tang Xiu!” replied Zhang Xinya without hesitation.</p><p>Cough! Cough!</p><p>Long Zhenglin was so stunned that he choked on his saliva. He was at a loss between either tears or laughter as he said, “I wouldn’t have asked had I known it earlier—asking or not ends up with the same result, damn it. Big Bro’s luck with pretty flowers is truly against heaven!”</p><p>“I know that he has great luck with women, but I don’t care. But… who exactly are you?” asked Zhang Xinya.</p><p>“Ehh? Tang Xiu hasn’t mentioned me to you?” Long Zhenglin rolled his eyes and resentfully said, “Long Zhenglin, the second young master of the Long Family? Darn it. I have always been his most faithful and loyal brother, for God’s sake!”</p><p>Zhang Xinya faintly smiled and said, “I once met Long Zhengyu, so you’re his younger brother! No wonder you have such bearings and temperament. You should also have tons of young women liking you, no?”</p><p>My demeanor, huh?</p><p>Long Zhenglin’s eyes lit up before he clapped his hands and smilingly said, “You seem to have good eyes, big sis-in-law. You’re right; though I may be not as charming and handsome as Tang Xiu, I still have my good demeanor, don’t I? Anyways, please have a seat big sis-in-law. Are you thirsty or would you some fruit? I’ll make some tea for you and called the Hotel’s attendant to send them immediately…</p><p>“Thank you.” Zhang Xinya smiled inwardly. Since Long Zhenglin came to Qinglin County with Tang Xiu, she could tell that this guy had a very close relationship with Tang Xiu. If she could make Long Zhenlin see her in a good light, she could get more news about Tang Xiu and this guy might be able to speak good things about her.</p><p>She was one who had been full of confidence of herself in the past, but Tang Xiu’s estranged attitude toward her had hit her so hard that she could only accept such treatment.</p><p>Qinglin County, at Wang Tao’s residence.</p><p>Tang Xiu calmly concocted the herbal medicine while a rich scent of medicinal herbs filled each corner of the kitchen. Yet, his mind was racing as he silently thought about some issues. At present, what he urgently needed to do was to get the Red Silk Flower as this magical herb was simply too scarce. But the Red Silk Flower obtained by Wang Tao unexpectedly had changed hands to Wang Rui’s father, the Deputy Abbot of Qingcheng Monastery. He didn’t know whether he would get that flower when he visited the Qingcheng Monastery the day after tomorrow.</p><p>‘Should I use something to exchange for it?’</p><p>‘Exchanging it with the immortal cultivation technique is out of the question since Qingcheng Monastery is also an old sect. Once I impart the immortal cultivation technique to someone from Qingcheng Monastery, this sect will definitely gather cultivation resources wantonly. That will prove to be very disadvantageous for my own progress and the Everlasting Feast Hall’s development.’</p><p>‘What about medicinal pills? This may be a good option, but I don’t know whether Wang Rui’s father will like the medicinal pills refined by me either.’</p><p>‘As for something else that can be used…’</p><p>Countless thoughts wandered in Tang Xiu’s mind, making him even put the call from Zhang Xinya to the back of his mind.</p><p>10:00 at night, Tang Xiu watched Wang Tao take the herbal medicine and apply the boiling liquid for an external application on the ulcerated area of his member. Then he explained, “Take the medication and apply it every day successively for half a month; then your illness will be completely cured. Also, take the herbs with you when you go with me to Qingcheng Monastery the day after tomorrow. That way, you can still boil and administer them when we get there.”</p><p>“No problem.” Wang Tao quickly complied.</p><p>Tang Xiu suddenly thought of something and asked, “If I list the names of some precious herbs, can you help me buy them? What I need are premium quality herbs. You can set the price for them.”</p><p>“I may not have the ability to accomplish other things, but I’m absolutely good when it comes to buying medicinal herbs.” Wang Tao grinned and said, “Qingcheng Mountain may not have various things, but it never lacks herbs. After we come back from the Qingcheng Monastery, as long as the precious herbs you need can be found here, I can buy them for you no matter how many.”</p><p>“Then I’ll present you a big gift if you can help me buy them,” said Tang Xiu with a smile.</p><p>“Big gift? What is it?” Wang Tao’s expression moved and he hurriedly inquired.</p><p>Tang Xiu patted his shoulder and smilingly said, “It won’t be a surprise if I tell you now, right? No rush, mate. You know haste makes waste. I’ll naturally fulfill my promise and gift you a big surprise when I obtain a lot of precious herbs from you later.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
