As he looked at the just abused female prisoner, he grinned and said, “You got quite a good luck to bump into us, you see. But you gotta remember, we never met tonight and the one who told you that you can leave is not me, capiche?”</p><p>After saying that, he no longer paid attention to the female prisoner and quickly disappeared into the stream of people who were rushing outside.</p><p>The name of the female convict was Chen Yan, who used to be a vicious and merciless fiendish character as well. She lived abroad with her parents since she was a child, and then faced a tragic fate after the death of her parents when she was still a minor. Afterward, she had been adopted by a certain black force, who then trained her and eventually turned her into a ruthless character who could kill without batting an eye.</p><p>Unfortunately, streaks of bad luck struck her as the black force she had been affiliated with, was then cracked down by the government and she was jailed for being an international wanted criminal. After being sent to the concentration camp 1319, she was desperate upon finding that the prison was not women’s prison, but a hellhole that detained both male and female convicts.</p><p>She was quite capable of herself but not very strong. It thus led to her being cast with covetous and greedy eyes by many male convicts for more than 4 years because of her good looks. If it wasn’t for the Boss of her cell, the 70-plus years old man who had covered her, she could have been tortured and dead. Despite so, the old man couldn’t escape the threat from the prison’s police officer. Without any means left to evade her predicament, she had been repeatedly molested and abused by those police officers.</p><p>Chen Yan watched the stream of people in the corridor. She quickly dressed up, wiped off the blood on her face and then headed out of her cell. To her shock inside, she found those who were now rushing outside were all very strong characters in the prison.</p><p>‘Exactly what happened here?’</p><p>She felt a bit restless and disturbed inside, yet she finally steeled herself and started to walk and follow the crowd to the outside. To her shock, yet again, they met dozens of guards at their posts, but they didn’t stop them, and even let the jailers who led the group to smoothly send them to the outermost gate.</p><p>“Open the gate!”</p><p>A police officer, who led ten or so jailers, looked at the prison guards who were on guarding duty at the gate and shouted before handing over the forged pass check to them.</p><p>“Where are you going with these many felons, man?” quickly asked the prison guard, who was in charge of guarding duty shift, with a change in expression.</p><p>“Warden’s order. He ordered us to go out to have them fight in the underground fighting match. What’s wrong? You wanna go against Warden Augustino’s order? Or, are you jealous of him making money?”</p><p>“No no no. Open the gate and let them go!”</p><p>The electric iron gate slowly opened as more than ten jailers led the convicts and left quickly. When the crowd stepped out of the prison gate, a look of ecstasy was evident on their faces as they ran straight to the front fast. Chen Yan was amid the stream of people. Little did she expect that she would finally encounter the day she was away from this prison. Her face was flushed red, full of excitement inwardly as she paced forward faster.</p><p>And yet, there was still something that surprised Chen Yan. All the convicts who escaped the prison were unexpectedly heading to the main road ahead. None of them separated and dispersed.</p><p>“Hey, where exactly are we going?” Asked Chen Yan to another convict who walked next to her after she deliberately picking up her speed and caught up with her.</p><p>The female convict looked at Chen Yan with a surprised expression and then grinned. “You don’t know where to go? Didn’t Boss tell you before?”</p><p>Boss?!</p><p>Chen Yan was dumbfounded. How could she know who that Boss was?! Being able to follow this crowd was completely due to the reminder of that Whisker fella. After the silence for a short while, she hurriedly replied, “Boss only said that he wanted me to go out. He didn’t say anything where to go, though. But I see that you seem to know where we’re heading to.”</p><p>The female convict picked up her speed more and quickly said while running, “Then don’t ask if the Boss didn’t tell you. Just follow everyone else and some people will meet and aid us outside.”</p><p>‘Some people are going to aid us?’</p><p>Chen Yan’s face slightly changed. Seeing that the female convict didn’t want to speak more, she suppressed the puzzlement inside. To her, being able to escape from this prison was the most important, to begin with. She could no longer withstand living inside anymore.</p><p>“Huh?”</p><p>Less than 2 kilometers from the prison gate, she could see two SUVs and four buses parked in front with the aid of the dim starlight in the sky.</p><p>With folded arms behind his back, Tang Xiu watched the dozens or so jailers and around 200 prisoners who were approaching fast. As the prison guard quickly approached, he nodded with satisfaction and said, “You’ve accomplished your mission, and the Vice-Warden should have told you what to do next. Take this, and thanks for your cooperation. There are 10 million dollars in that suitcase as a token of my regard.”</p><p>An ecstatic look covered the constable in charge’s face. He respectfully saluted Tang Xiu, and then quickly took the suitcase and quickly disappeared into the night in the distance along with more than ten of prison guards.</p><p>“Boss.”</p><p>200 heavily sentenced convicts quickly gathered in front of Tang Xiu, each with fiery eyes that contained deep respect. They still didn’t know Tang Xiu’s origins yet, but they were aware of two facts. Their future Big Boss was very strong, and he was definitely a man who was also adept at in trickery and schemes.</p><p>Otherwise, who would have dared to purchase 200 prisoners from the world’s harshest and most horrible concentration camp 1319? Who else could afford to buy 200 convicts?</p><p>They might be dreadful characters once, but they were also smart people and were crystal clear that they had been purchased today and how much sensation and a huge stir it would make internationally.</p><p>Tang Xiu happily nodded and shouted, “First of all, I want to congratulate you on being able to leave that place and come here alive. I also congratulate you on the more exciting future life you’ll have. However, remember my words, that I’m the sole reason that can go on living in the future. Alright, everyone. Keep the order and board your bus in turn. We’ll soon leave for the waterway and boarded the already prepared liner.”</p><p>Mo Awu paced two steps forward and said in a heavy voice, “Form 4 groups and board your bus respectively!”</p><p>A few minutes later, all the purchased convicts had boarded the buses. After Tang Xiu taking a seat in one of the SUVs, Mo Awu strode to the car’s window and whispered, “Unforeseen things happened, Boss.”</p><p>“What accident?” asked Tang Xiu with slightly creased brows.</p><p>“We just counted the number of people and except for Spectre, there should be 199 prisoners here since Spectre is currently with Jin Shi and Xue Sha to carry out their mission, so Spectre is not here,” said Mo Awu. “But from the number we just counted, there are a total 200 people here and Spectre is not around.”</p><p>“We got one extra?” Tang Xiu wore a strange expression.</p><p>“Yes. We got one more,” answered Mo Awu.</p><p>“Take some men and cross-check the list, Awu,” said Tang Xiu with a smile. “Find that extra and bring the person to me.”</p><p>“Understood!”</p><p>As the car started and left to the distance, Mo Awu, who boarded one of the cars, and other members of the escort began to cross-check the list in four buses.</p><p>Inside the third bus.</p><p>Chen Yan was feeling a bit restless as she quietly sat in the last row seat, with two female convicts at her sides. She knew who these two female convicts were as they held quite a name in the entire concentration camp 1319 for being vicious, merciless yet very strong characters. She even had witnessed one of them once tore apart the body of a black man with her bare hand, and thus added 218 years more to her sentence.</p><p>That, however, was not the chief reason she was feeling restless inside. What she was worried about was that young man she had just seen was definitely a very powerful man. Even she couldn’t tell whether she had been accidentally drawn into this huge incident was a blessing or a calamity.</p><p>‘No good.’</p><p>Chen Yan’s complexion abruptly changed when she saw two sturdy men holding the list and walked from the front while counting the number of people and calling out their numbers.</p><p>‘What should I do?’</p><p>Chen Yan’s mood turned chaotic. She wanted to jump out of the window to escape, but the other convicts around her may not allow her to escape. It was very likely that she would be captured in a flash and be killed on the spot.</p><p>Hei Xiong, who was holding the list, kept counting until the last row of seat. He watched the five female convicts and inquired with a heavy voice, “State your name and your prison number.”</p><p>“Ivy Cody, 0001184.”</p><p>“Candy, 0000634.”</p><p>Chen Yan took a deep breath and said, “Chen Yan, 0000460.”</p><p>“Wait a sec.”</p><p>Hei Xiong looked at the list and after skimming through it several times, he didn’t find the name of Chen Yan. His sharp eyes sized up Chen Yan and said in a deep voice, “Where the hell did you come from? Your name is not listed on the list of the purchased prisoners!”</p><p>Chen Yan steeled her heart and answered, “I accidentally saw a lot of prisoners coming out along the corridor, so I came out of my cell and joined everyone else. But I’m also perplexed, how stupid and confused I was to appear here.”</p><p>“You what?”</p><p>Hei Xiong was stunned silly and many convicts around him looked at Chen Yan with a strange expression.</p><p>After Hei Xiong collected himself, he responded and immediately ordered, “Come with me!”</p><p>“Where to?” asked Chen Yao quickly.</p><p>“To see the Boss!” answered Hei Xiong with a deadpan expression.</p><p>He made a phone call and the two SUVs in front then stopped. After which, Hei Xiong took Chen Yan to arrive outside the SUV’s window where Tang Xiu was riding, and then respectfully reported, “Boss, I brought the said person.”</p><p>Tang Xiu glanced at Chen Yan and lightly said, “Get on the car.”</p><p>Chen Yan walked to the other side of the car with some worries inside. After opening the door, she took a seat next to Tang Xiu but didn’t hurry to talk. She was so tense and restless inside and fully guarded against Tang Xiu in case this guy would suddenly attack her.</p><p>The convoy then began moving again.</p><p>Tang Xiu took out a cigarette from his pocket, ignited it and took and blew out two deep puffs. As he blew out the smoke, he slowly said, “Aren’t you owing me an explanation?”</p><p>Chen Yan’s lips squirmed a few times before she shook her head and said, “Umm, well… I dunno how to explain it, really. I was at a loss and baffled why I brought myself here.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
