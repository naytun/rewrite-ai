Kuwako also sent her people to catch up with her, so that everything proceeded smoothly. Tang Xiu also gave one of the tech products to Cheng Xuemei so she could deal with some people in Japan. Without a doubt, that tech product was nothing but trash, a type of auxiliary product that was consumer goods.</p><p>When they separated, Tang Xiu only said a few words to Cheng Xuemei, but he believed that she would understand the meaning, “Cheng Xuemei, you’re one of Tang Xiu’s people from now on. You’ll still be one of my people even after you become a ghost. Only I can make you go further down the path you’ve chosen to walk on for thousands of years in the future.”</p><p>Early in the morning.</p><p>The first ray of sunshine rose from the East as the Subaquatic Corvette anchored near the port of Jingmen Island. Following the discussion with Tang Guosheng previously, the space around the small port had been removed of people and ships, and the area had now been taken over by the Everlasting Feast Hall.</p><p>On the shoreside near the port, Duanmu Lin and Tang Guosheng stood side by side while several members of the China Special Ability Bureau waited with expectation.</p><p>“Are you sure Tang Xiu told you today, Old Tang?”</p><p>Duanmu was also full of similar expectations. Tang Guosheng informed him that Tang Xiu obtained a type of submarine, a subaquatic corvette from three-star vestige. The news practically gave him insomnia. Another thing he learned was that Tang Xiu used that submarine to kill tens of ability users from the USA’s Special Ability Bureau. Even their number one figure, Dorot, was murdered. Thus, he was even more eager to see the submarine.</p><p>Tang Guosheng smiled at his words and said, “When have I ever lied to you? Xiu’er asked me to inform you. If you don’t believe me, let’s stop waiting here, then.”</p><p>Duanmu Lin immediately let out an apologetic smile and smiled. “Don’t! I may not believe anyone else, but you, Old Tang, are someone I believe 100%, no, 10,000%! Let alone waiting for a day, I’ll keep waiting for more than a year.”</p><p>Tang Guosheng looked pleased and smilingly said, “No worries, then! Xiu’er always keeps his word. I can’t say precisely, but he should appear in front of us in a while…”</p><p>His voice was abruptly stopped as Tang Guosheng saw the subaquatic corvette emerge and float on the surface ahead. Excitement covered his old face as he raised his hand to point to it and shouted, “Speak of the devil. That’s the submarine I told you about. Xiu’er and the others have come back!”</p><p>Duanmu looked around and watched the cabin hatch of the subaquatic corvette open as Tang Xiu and Gu Xiaoxue came out from inside. He suddenly paced forward and loudly greeted Tang Xiu, “Welcome back, Tang Xiu!”</p><p>Tang Xiu and Gu Xiaoxue walked on the surface of the sea and headed straight to the front of Duanmu Lin and Tang Guosheng. Then he smilingly said, “Well, the feeling of coming back alive is really great; I can taste it, Senior Duanmu. Also, I haven’t let you down either. I can be said to have made great merit and contributions, and I even brought you back a large number of treasures. It’s a pity that I wasn’t able to bring back anything else when I came out though. If I had, it would have really benefitted our country.”</p><p>Duanmu Lin grabbed Tang Xiu’s hand amiably and said, “It’s enough. This is enough. I learned the specific details of what this subaquatic corvette can do from your grandfather. It’s something that I’ve never dreamed about! It’s just a submarine, yet it can completely annihilate tens of ability users from the U.S. Special Ability Bureau, and even accomplished the most important issue, eliminating Dorot. This subaquatic corvette is definitely the epitome of a seabed terror killer!”</p><p>Tang Xiu chuckled and said, “Well, I don’t know if it’s some terrifying killer or not. I just know that its weapon configuration is really great—well equipped and fast. By the way, it also has an excellent interior too. The extraterrestrial race who left behind these remains really understood how to enjoy life.”</p><p>“Can you take me to see the submarine?” asked Duanmu with a smile.</p><p>“Senior Duanmu, I obtained this subaquatic corvette from the three-star vestige, but I can’t be said to own it as my personal property. You represent the government who I want to give this submarine to, so the subaquatic corvette will be handed over to you.”</p><p>“You truly know what’s right and what principle to follow, Tang Xiu. A role model for the young generation,” praised Duanmu Lin with satisfaction. “I accept this subaquatic corvette on behalf of our country, and I believe the reward from the state will be handed over to you soon.”</p><p>“Well, this port is kind of a good place,” said Tang Xiu out of the blue, a smile on the corners of his mouth.</p><p>“The members of our Special Ability Bureau will withdraw immediately, and this area will be handed over to your Everlasting Feast Hall,” said Duanmu Lin without hesitation. “Also, you can expect the government’s approval documents to be sent to you soon. This place will become your Everlasting Feast Hall’s private port.”</p><p>“Then I’d like to thank you for that, Senior Duanmu,” said Tang Xiu with a smile. “I’ll also tell Kang Xia to send 100 roomes of God’s Nectar to the headquarters of the Special Ability Bureau, both as a token of goodwill and my thanks.”</p><p>“Good. Good, good.”</p><p>The wrinkles on Duanmu Lin’s face stretched out and his smile was sincerely coming from his heart.</p><p>Tang Xiu then looked at Tang Guosheng and inquired, “What are you going to do after this, Grandpa? Do you want to go with me to the Everlasting Feast Hall, or are you leaving Jingmen Island with Senior Duanmu?”</p><p>Tang Guosheng keenly sensed the faint peculiar light in Duanmu Lin’s eyes and immediately replied, “Nah, I don’t want to get into the mess that young people like you guys get in. I’m going back to the capital when Brother Duanmu is done here.”</p><p>“Well, it’s been hectic for me recently, so I’ll stay in Jingmen Island and have a good rest.” Tang Min, who was behind her father, suddenly interjected and smilingly said, “Your paternal aunt wants to stay here; are you not going to entertain me, Xiu’er?”</p><p>“I naturally must entertain you with the best hospitality since you’re willing to stay, auntie,” replied Tang Xiu with a smile. “In that case, we’ll take our leave, Senior Duanmu. Please feel free to contact me whenever you need my assistance.”</p><p>A disappointed look flashed in Duanmu Lin’s eyes, but he still nodded with a smile. He thought that Tang Guosheng would choose to go with Tang Xiu. That way, he could have an excuse to visit the Everlasting Feast Hall as well. He couldn’t figure out the actual situation of the Everlasting Feast Hall the last time he visited the premises. But if he went with Tang Guosheng, he might have an unexpected discovery of what he wanted to find out.</p><p>‘It’s really a pity…’ Duanmu Lin felt somewhat helpless inside.</p><p>Immediately after, four cars left the port, and Tang Xiu brought Tang Min to the Everlasting Feast Hall. The latter received the best hospitality there, and even Gu Yan’er came out of the exquisite pagoda after she got the news. Tang Min was very curious about her, so she grabbed her to have a chat for a long time. She even learned a lot of things from her that gave her a huge shock.</p><p>As the day faded away and night came, and as Tang Xiu had dinner with Tang Min, Gu Xiaoxue came to the private room. She looked at Tang Xiu and said, “Grand Master, Banshou came and he learned that you’re here, so he wants to see you.”</p><p>“Banshou is currently in the Everlasting Feast Hall?” asked Tang Xiu, surprised.</p><p>“He just escorted ten street children from the Northwestern region yesterday. Except for two children, eight of them have an excellent aptitude and personality. He originally planned to leave tonight, but after learning that you’re here, he wants to see you. He said that he needs to report his work,” said Gu Xiaoxue.</p><p>“How many children have been adopted by our Everlasting Feast Hall now, exactly? What’s the specific number?” asked Tang Xiu.</p><p>“Combined with the last eight children, a total of 62,200,” answered Gu Xiaoxue.</p><p>“That many?” Tang Xiu was shocked. “How can it dramatically increase like that all of a sudden?”</p><p>“The Northwestern region has been struck with droughts that makes life in some impoverished areas very difficult,” explained Gu Xiaoxue with a forced smile. “Thus, the situation has led to cases where the inhabitants began to sell their children and women. The government has been working hard to solve the problems there, but there are too many people in need of help. Life has been difficult for a lot of the street children and orphans. So much so that a dozen or so orphanages have been sending out children to Banshou to take care of after exploiting some special means.”</p><p>“Why would the orphanages want the children out?” Tang Xie was puzzled.</p><p>“Those ten or so orphanages are going to close soon,” replied Gu Xiaoxue. “If we don’t take the children, I’m afraid these kids will become homeless sooner or later. Also, those orphanages are actually private orphanages that rely on public donations. There have been only a few kind-hearted people who’re willing to adopt the children there.”</p><p>Tang Xiu caught the gist in a flash as he nodded and said, “What about the traces to us? Have you cleared them up?”</p><p>“When Banshou’s team reported this to me, I realized some people with ambitions would find out about this large-scale adoption of orphans, so I sent a group of our Everlasting Feast Hall’s elites to clean up all the traces. Nobody will find out about any leads even if they want to investigate it,” said Gu Xiaoxue.</p><p>“Alright, then.” Tang Xiu took a deep breath and looked at her. “Bring Banshou here!”</p><p>“Alright.”</p><p>As Gu Xiaoxue left the room, Tang Min asked with a surprised look, “What are you gonna do after adopting so many homeless children?”</p><p>“I’m going to train and cultivate them to build an army of cultivators,” answered Tang Xiu.</p><p>“Forming an army of cultivators?” Tang Min was struck dumb with wonder, “What exactly do you wanna do? Could it be that your real intention is to rule the world?”</p><p>“Auntie, do you really think the objective of your nephew is just to that point? Only to rule this world?” Tang Xiu shook his head and laughed. “Hahaha… When my strength has reached a certain level, even a sneeze of mine would be enough to make the whole Earth explode. Didn’t you just hear the existence of the Immortal World from Yan’er? I brought up these children to cultivate them so that they will be able to follow me. I hope for them to become good helpers for me to move unhindered in the Immortal World later.”</p><p>Tang Min was silent for a few minutes before asking with a bit of anticipation on her face, “Do you think your auntie has any hope of going to the Immortal World, Xiu’er?”</p><p>“It won’t be a problem in the future if you’re interested,” answered Tang Xiu with a smile. “At the worst, I’ll just have to trick the Heavenly Dao rules in this world. By then, the entire Tang Family can follow me into the Immortal World.”</p><p>“Awesome!” Tang Min fiercely clapped and called out excitedly.</p><p>“But Auntie, it’s best not to tell even Grandpa about what you’ve known for the time being,” said Tang Xiu with a smile. “After all, these issues are no trivial matter. Once they are leaked, I’m afraid that it will bring unnecessary troubles to our family. And I already have arrangements set up for the Tang Family in the future.”</p><p>“Good. Good. Good. I’ll keep it in mind,” replied Tang Min quickly.</p><p>Quickly, Banshou came in a hurry to the private room and excitedly shouted when he saw Tang Xiu, “Boss! I can meet you at last. I went to Shanghai a couple of days ago, but found out that you weren’t there.”</p><p>Tang Xiu smiled and waved at him, gesturing Banshou to take a seat and then smilingly said, “You’ve been working hard these days. I’ll give you a target to reach now. You will stop adopting children when the number has reached 80,000. I will have other arrangements for you and Dingzhi by then.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
