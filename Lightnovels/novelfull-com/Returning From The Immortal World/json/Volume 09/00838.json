It seemed like this guy should be sentenced for a few hundred years judging by his criminal record.</p><p>“How many years is his sentence?” Tang Xiu interrupted Sander and asked with a pale smile.</p><p>Sander glanced at Saptanshu and lightly said, “With such heavy crimes, he’s been sentenced to 260 years.”</p><p>“He’s quite interesting, I think, and should be suitable to stay in cell 18.” Tang Xiu smiled and said, “Warden, how about you stretch the rules and put him in the same cell with me?”</p><p>“Alright, take him to the cell 18, too.” Sander nodded. “Trash this brat first if he’s crossing the line.”</p><p>Immediately after, the 13 people including Saptanshu looked at Tang Xiu with a weird expression. They really couldn’t tell something. Is this guy a fellow convict or the Boss of this prison? This fellow convict just talked with the Warden, and the latter actually listened to him?</p><p>The few prison guards who were with Sander were the latter’s trusted men. Although they didn’t understand why their immediate superior would listen to a prisoner, they still immediately released Saptanshu’s handcuffs and pushed him to follow behind Sander and head outside.</p><p>They walked along the corridor with many gates. The longer they passed through the corridor, the heavier guarded it was with tighter security. As they walked halfway through, the group took the elevator to the fourth floor and walked down the dark corridor to the end. They then found prison cell 18. When the steel door to the cell opened, Tang Xiu and Saptanshu were pushed inside.</p><p>“This is your place now; I’ll come to teach you every day,” said Sander with some deep, mysterious meanings in his words. He deeply looked at Tang Xiu and then immediately ordered the prison guard to close the door and lock it from the outside.</p><p>There were four prisoners inside the cell already. But Tang Xiu couldn’t believe that there was a woman among them. The woman had the muscles of a bodybuilder and looked exceptionally robust and stocky. There was a fierce scar on the left cheek of her rough face that looked like a poisonous scorpion.</p><p>As for the other three, one was a middle-aged man who boasted a burly and stocky physique with a lot of tattoos on his body; even two-thirds of his naked arms were fully covered in tattoos.</p><p>There was also a thin old man with white hair, seemingly in the last years of his life. However, although the two dumbbells in his hands were at least tens of kilograms, they looked very light in his hands that were continually lifting and putting them down.</p><p>The last one was a gentle looking young man around 25 years old. He wore gold-rimmed glasses and sat in the innermost corner of the cell reading a book. He didn’t even look up, nor did he blink, when Tang Xiu and Saptanshu were sent inside.</p><p>“How interesting. Two prisoners were sent to our cell at once. This is the first time in history,” The burly man, who sat on the bunk, stroked his chin and grinned.</p><p>Tang Xiu observed the four people before he finally shifted his sight to Saptanshu and smilingly said, “Well, I heard that the first thing that happens when someone first arrives at a cell is that the old inmates will haze them with beatings. Judging from their looks, you’ll probably suffer from beatings and bruises, mate.”</p><p>Saptanshu angrily glared at Tang Xiu and clenched his fist which emitted cracking sounds from his bones. He then grimly said, “Brat, I think I need to teach you a lesson before we get beaten then. No way those fucking guards sent me to this cell if it wasn’t because of your dirty fucking trick, asshole.”</p><p>Slap…</p><p>Tang Xiu just raised his hand and slapped Saptanshu’s face in response to his words. Before the fellow was able to respond, he pulled him into the air and smashed him into a single bed a few meters away and spoke casually, “Me taking you here is actually good for you, bastard. Don’t swear at me before you figure out how else I’ll make you learn to be docile and obey me.”</p><p>Having said that, he looked at the other few people who had surprised faces as they watched him, and then said, “Well, I’m a newcomer here and I’ll probably disturb you all for a few days. The name is Xiu. The four of you, why don’t you introduce yourselves to me?”</p><p>The burly man wore a bit of a serious expression when he looked at Tang Xiu. He saw Tang Xiu’s beat Saptanshu a while ago with a speed that secretly shocked him inside. He was also a ruthless man and once killed a tiger bare-handed. He even fought with polar bears to the death and the number of enemies that died to his hands for decades was numbered in the tens of people.</p><p>Yet, he could very well see that the Oriental young man in front of him was definitely an expert.</p><p>“Xiu, eh? That’s a very interesting name, and you’re also very powerful. If you can knock Emily down, it will prove that you have the ability to make us introduce ourselves to you.”</p><p>The bodybuilder-like female convict coldly snorted and interjected discontentedly, “Your balls shrink after seeing a powerful expert, Katu? To think that you’re pushing me to beat him, do you find it interesting or something?”</p><p>“Well, my balls are indeed shrinking back to my stomach in front of you, Emily.” Katu grinned and said, “Spare the nonsense and just play with him, will you? Let us see which of you can stand and have the right to talk.”</p><p>Emily rolled her eyes and immediately looked at Tang Xiu, then hooked her index finger and said without being salty, “That shit tried to see us have some play, so I might as well use it as a warm-up. I definitely won’t break your legs, brat. But as for your hands… that will depend on my mood.”</p><p>“If I must fight you all, only that old man is worth a fight. As for you, though… I think it’s better for you to forget it!” Tang Xiu shook his head indifferently.</p><p>The white-haired old man let out a pale smile that contained meaning. “Do you really want to fight me, child? You wanna bully this gramps?”</p><p>“Well, it’s better to bully you than beat these few weak people, don’t you think?” Tang Xiu smiled.</p><p>Emily seemed to have been insulted by the words. She roared and instantly hurled toward Tang Xiu. Her speed was extremely fast—almost comparable to the martial arts grandmaster level. Her howling fist appeared in front of Tang Xiu in a blink of an eye and attempted to knock down Tang Xiu.</p><p>Crack…</p><p>Tang Xiu reached out and grabbed her fist. He then followed with a seemingly light punch that instantly smashed Emily’s face. The latter screamed as the blow sent her backward over six meters away, and she fell heavily on the bed of the youth who was reading a book.</p><p>The pupils of the white-haired old man contracted and the smile on his face instantly vanished. He watched Tang Xiu with a solemn look and said after taking a deep breath, “You’re very powerful indeed, Xiu. Not even I can become your opponent since I can’t beat Emily in just one strike. Alright, I’ll introduce myself to you. You can call me Old Anji.”</p><p>Old Anji?</p><p>The information about the inmates in this cell from the file that Sander gave him appeared in Tang Xiu’s mind. The report said that this Old Anji was once a mercenary, a terrifying character who had gone through hails of bullets from fierce battlefields, yet he still lived for decades. It was said that the number of people he had killed was definitely in the hundreds.</p><p>“It’s really a pity that you’re too old to fight the enemies. You can only be a guard at the nursing home now,” Tang Xiu spoke out some words that the Old Anji couldn’t figure out. He then stared at the youth who never looked up and lightly said, “You should be an Asian given your looks. Which country are you from?”</p><p>The young man raised his head for the first time while his fingers held his glasses. He let out a shy smile at Tang Xiu and answered, “China. The name is Zhang Xiaohua.”</p><p>Zhang Xiaohua?</p><p>Information regarding him appeared in Tang Xiu’s mind. This guy was the world’s top hacker who created the most terrifying virus on the internet, ‘The Spider’, which paralyzed the network in some European country for four days and indirectly caused a few billions of dollars in losses. The file also noted that he should possess special abilities since he could kill 29 people by himself, plus he destroyed 16 buildings which led to more than 140 people being injured.</p><p>“Can you let me see your special abilities, Zhang Xiaohua?” asked Tang Xiu in Mandarin.</p><p>A suspicious look appeared on Zhang Xiaohua’s face. He put down the book in his hand, then leaned on the wall and looked at Tang Xiu as he asked, “You’re also a Chinese?”</p><p>“I am.” Tang Xiu nodded.</p><p>“How do you know that I have special abilities?” asked Zhang Xiaohua curiously.</p><p>“The whole prison detains 1,260 convicts and I’ve read each inmate’s criminal records, including yours,” answered Tang Xiu.</p><p>Zhang Xiaohua looked empty and he asked quizzically, “The information on the inmates of this prison should be top secret. There are only a few outsiders who can view it apart from the highest-ranking officials of this prison, no? I hacked the prison network system to read information of the prisoners here previously; are you also well-versed in computer networks and a hacker?”</p><p>“I’m not a hacker, nor am I well-versed in networks,” Tang Xiu shook his head. “It’s just that you’re gifted and I think for you to stay here is quite a pity. Maybe I’ll tell you more if you get out of prison.”</p><p>Having said that, he could see that Zhang Xiaohua didn’t have the intention to show his special ability, so he directly ignored him. Then he turned around to look at Saptanshu and sneered, “Stay obediently there and don’t mess with me, else those four can teach you a lesson.”</p><p>“Grandma told me once that a wise man must know when to sit back when the odds are against him,” replied Saptanshu as he slumped down to sit on the side and stretched his hands against the bed leg.</p><p>Tang Xiu nodded with satisfaction and turned around to walk to the front of the cell. He then heavily kicked the cell door as two prison guards rushed over in just a few seconds. One of them used his electric baton to slam the iron window and shouted, “Stay still and be quiet!”</p><p>“I wanna see the prisoner in front,” said Tang Xiu.</p><p>“You what?”</p><p>The two prison guards outside were shocked, watching Tang Xiu as though he was a lunatic. They were not the only ones, of course, as the old inmates of the cell 18 were similarly looking at Tang Xiu like he was a madman.</p><p>‘Is this guy looking for death?’</p><p>The same thought emerged in their minds as everyone in the entire prison knew that the cell in front was cell 1, a cell that only detained one inmate. That was the fellow that could be called the devil himself… Spectre.</p><p>Up till now, no one dared to enter that cell. Those who had gone in before had all turned into corpses.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
