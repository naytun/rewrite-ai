She hastily ran to the front of Tang Guosheng and shouted, “KILL THEM!”</p><p>The two men and two women who had been standing behind Tang Min moved in a flash. One of the women instantly appeared in front of Tang Min and released a dreadful aura. The longsword she always carried in the scabbard on her back was jettisoned upward immediately. The moment she brandished it, she created a layer of swaying sword images.</p><p>A storm blasted out in a flash, which simulated the water to billow upward from both sides of the liner.</p><p>The rolling, billowing waves were accompanied by layers of sword images that instantly swept across the two fire dragons. The stocky man only felt darkness in front of him as his two fire dragons were torn apart and shattered by the bombardment, creating splashes of flame everywhere. Yet, the oncoming sword images were still on their path to strike him head-on. His pupils shrunk and he forcefully pushed his hands forward.</p><p>“Wall of Fire!”</p><p>Layers of overlapping flames rapidly coagulated and stretched densely like a cobweb, eventually forming a thick wall of fire. The rolling flame kept flowing and was injected into the wall of fire when it then pressed forward toward the sword images.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The stocky man shook and staggered while backing up in that instant. At the moment when the two streams of fire formed above the sea, he flew back to their passenger liner. The four French ability users behind him, however, unleashed their powers one after another, forming a whistling cyclone which was entangled with water arrows. The two powers complemented each other, causing their speed to increase to the max, and they aggressively strode forward at the moment when the wall of fire was destroyed.</p><p>Blast…</p><p>The four people were thrown back upside down by the rolling waves. But at the moment when they were blown away, several strops of wind were released by the Wind Elementalist on the passenger liner behind them, wrapping their bodies and taking them back to their liner deck.</p><p>The middle-aged woman who just brandished the sword paced back for three steps in order to stabilize herself. Her sharp eyes were tightly locked on the stocky man and she sneered, “Hmph, such weak ability users, yet you dare to waylay in broad daylight? Surely not all Frenchmen are as wild and unbridled as you?”</p><p>The stocky man’s expression turned a bit ugly, and he likewise glared back at the middle-aged woman and growled, “Who the hell are you? What power did you just use, and how can it be that powerful?”</p><p>The middle-aged woman just sneered in response and ignored him. Instead, she looked at the surprised Tang Min and nodded at her, then returned to her previous position behind.</p><p>“Do the others have similar strength as you?” asked Tang Min hurriedly.</p><p>“More or less, yes,” answered the middle-aged woman.</p><p>“If the four of you join forces, can you kill their leader?” asked Tang Min once again.</p><p>“I would need some major effort to do so if it’s me alone, but the collateral damage would destroy the ship. If two of us join forces, it would be enough to eliminate him. And he would never leave this sea again even if he had two lives if the four of us join hands.” The middle-aged woman nodded.</p><p>“Then what are you waiting for? Just kill them immediately, these French are really screwed!” said Tang Min excitedly.</p><p>“Don’t act for now,” said Tang Guosheng quickly. “They have too many people and their strength is not something to scoff at. I’ll tell them to retreat first; it wouldn’t be too late for you to act if they refuse.”</p><p>The power of the middle-aged woman sent by his grandson, Tang Xiu, truly shocked him. He thought that Tang Xiu had neglected these people. It made Tang Guosheng instantly remember that his grandson told him that all core members of the Everlasting Feast Hall were Daoist cultivators.</p><p>At this time, he looked at the Elementalists on the enemy’s ship. His fear and dread were no longer there as he lifted his head up and stared at the stocky man. He then shouted heavily, “This is your last warning. BACK OFF AT ONCE! Else I will fulfill the threats you gave me, but on you!”</p><p>Although the stocky man was a bit perplexed, he was fearless. He still had some deadly cards up his sleeve, so he boisterously laughed at the warning. “Hmph, you wanna scare us away by depending on that old hag? Old man, your old fossil head seems to have been kicked by a donkey, wasn’t it? Waterflood, your turn.”</p><p>“No problem.”</p><p>A hot, voluptuous woman with a willow-like slender waist and provocative attire paced a few steps forward. With the sound of delicate laughter, drizzles suddenly began to pour down from the sky. At the same time, six men and women in azure attire and holding various types of weapons, came from behind her and rose in the air.</p><p>Around the liner they were boarding, the already billowing sea surface suddenly became more violent and the wind increased in intensity. Then, water columns shot up to the sky for a total of 72 pillars, and they absorbed the drizzles around them amid their extreme rotations.</p><p>“Be careful. Don’t let the ship be flipped over!”</p><p>Tang Min, who was standing on the deck, swayed a few times.</p><p>In that instant, the four men and women who had longswords on their backs flashed forward like shooting shells and instantly appeared on the ship in front. Their four longswords were immediately spinning and mixing with each other, instantly forming a Four Divisions Sword Array. This was followed by a burst of horrifying aura which caused the increasingly dense water columns around them to become slightly distorted.</p><p>“Sword Shadows–Lightstream!”</p><p>An overwhelming sword light that blotted out the sky howled forward towards the enemy ship. The four figures behind the sword light then stirred up the void in the surroundings and formed an exceptional dark space. The seemingly alive water columns were rushing to attack them, but the violently spinning sword light gradually turned the sea into a terrifying space of endless heavy rain.</p><p>****</p><p>Ten thousand meters away from the battle scene.</p><p>A cargo ship was floating on the sea, containing a man and a woman dressed in black tuxedos standing atop its roof. The man was tall and handsome yet forceful, while the woman was tender and charming. They were looking at the sea in the distance as though they were able to see through the void. They turned out to be watching the scene of the battle over 10,000 meters away.</p><p>“If my guess is correct, those four should be the Chinese legendary Daoist ascetics, Dorot. Only those kinds of people would be able to unleash such a powerful combat power,” said the delicate and pretty woman with a smile as she teased the hair on her temple with her lily-white hands, adding a mature charm to her femininity.</p><p>“Hmph, they are the so-called Chinese ascetics indeed,” snorted Dorot. “I once met a brat who was stronger than those four. But that brat was too wild and arrogant, so my Master and his senior brother joined hands to kill him. I wouldn’t have let my Master die at that time due to his heavy injuries if I had possessed my current strength.”</p><p>“I don’t think so.” The belle shook her head and said, “Your Master used to be a very powerful ability user in our country, the United States. He also participated in the Crusaders’ eastern expedition; even currently, you are not as good as he once was. Though he passed away due to his severe injuries, you still wouldn’t be able to replace the version of him when he died. In any case, those French ability users are quite capable, like that Waterflood I’m quite acquainted with. I once fought and defeated her, and I know that the six behind her are all ability users of the water attribute. Their combined abilities lead to a drastic increase in power—more than tenfold. So, what do you think? Who will win the showdown in the end, the Chinese or those French Elementalists?”</p><p>“No matter who is stronger or weaker, they will not be the ones who will be the final winner,” said Dorot apathetically. “Those French didn’t get anything in three-star vestige, but those Chinese obtained quite a lot. We can’t do anything to them on Haiben Island, but here…. We have to get the things they obtained from the three-star vestige.”</p><p>The delicate belle smilingly replied, “Let me do it, but know that you’ll still have to pay the price.”</p><p>“Hmph. I know what you want.” Dorot snorted. “You want the water attribute crystals, don’t you? I’ll give them to you. If you’re still not satisfied, I’ll find someone to help you manufacture a water attribute wand after going back.”</p><p>The belle’s eyes lit up and replied without hesitation, “Deal!”</p><p>****</p><p>Back to the battle scene.</p><p>The four experts of the Everlasting Feast Hall had fully unleashed their powers.No matter how imposing and majestic the scenes created by the combined powers of Waterflood and the other Water Elementalists were, they were still far inferior to the Four Divisions Sword Array. Even the French ship was smashed with dozens of fractures created by the sword chops from the violent sword array. The array alone seemed like it was about to solve the predicament, judging by the appearance of the whole ship.</p><p>“MOVE AND SEIZE THEIR SHIP!”</p><p>The stocky man roared and hurled toward the four experts of the Everlasting Feast Hall. At the same time, the tens of other ability users soared and unleashed each of their powers one after another, launching a fierce attack toward the Tang Family.</p><p>The battle was brutal and ruthless with combatants dying here and there.</p><p>Despite fighting each other to the death at this time, both sides were trying not to damage the ships. They were aware that whichever side survived the battle would still need the ship to leave this place.</p><p>****</p><p>Hundreds of nautical miles away from the battle scene was a yellow sand island. Tang Xiu was silently sitting cross-legged on a reef, continually absorbing the star force from outer space. With his diligent cultivation, his Stars Tyrannical Body cultivation became more profound, and he was only two layers away from achieving perfection.</p><p>Kacha, kacha…</p><p>A robot bee flickered its metal wings and landed in front of Tang Xiu. As its claws landed on the reef, it finally ejected out some holographic footage.</p><p>As Tang Xiu opened his eyes and watched the scene displayed on the holographic footage, his complexion instantly changed. His fingers slid from the virtual screen as a series of strange symbols emerged, the characters and numbers of the Posdoret galaxy.</p><p>The numbers displayed the exact distance from his position to the location of the scene displayed on the holographic screen.</p><p>“You two, come back!”</p><p>Tang Xiu’s figure soared in the sky and looked down, and he shouted to Gu Xiaoxue and Cheng Xuemei from two kilometers away</p><p>After some time passed, two figures sprinted quickly. Cheng Xuemei, who sprinted after turning off her gravity suit, was now able to control part of her power. Although her speed was much slower than that of Gu Xiaoxue’s, she was already delighted with it.</p><p>“You called for us, Grand Master?” asked Gu Xiaoxue.</p><p>Tang Xiu instantly flew toward the Subaquatic Corvette anchored on the shore and left his voice behind, “Return to the Subaquatic Corvette at once. Our people are being attacked hundreds of nautical miles away from us. We must rescue them immediately.”</p><p>Our people?</p><p>Gu Xiaoxue’s complexion changed. Her figure flashed and instantly appeared next to Cheng Xuemei. Her white-lily-like hands grabbed Cheng Xuemei’s collar and she took her to dash to the Subaquatic Corvette.</p><p>“Who are ‘our people’ that we need to rescue, Grand Master?” quickly asked Gu Xiaoxue as she appeared at Tang Xiu’s side.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
