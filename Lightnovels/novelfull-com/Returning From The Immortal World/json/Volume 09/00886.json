The country’s major media flocked to this bustling city while countless fans who loved to collect antiques, people who liked jades, experts who studied jade carvings, and even some businesspeople came to the city one after another.</p><p>As for Paradise Manor, this dining, leisure, and entertainment venue was full of tourists in recent days as numerous people had filled the hotels and cottages near it, so much so that the available rooms were unable to entirely fulfill the demand.</p><p>For the people that couldn’t find accommodations, they simply set up tents outside the Paradise Manor while waiting for the people who owned the twelve zodiac jade carvings to appear.</p><p>“Who will become rich billionaires?”</p><p>It was the topic that was widespread and was all the rage nowadays.</p><p>Hao Lei was now inside the VIP building of Paradise Manor. Her name was quite a sensation and quite famous now. She sat near the window, frowning and looking distressed as she watched the crowd streaming in tides outside without saying a word for a long time.</p><p>Creak…</p><p>The door was opened and Chi Nan entered with a small smile as she looked at Hao Lei who turned around in surprise. She spoke with a smile, “Well, how’s the taste of becoming a big star, Sis Lili? Is it fascinating enjoying the taste of fame?”</p><p>Hao Lei forced a wry smile. “If I knew this would turn into this kind of carnival, I wouldn’t have agreed to supervise this matter when Boss asked me to—even if I was beaten to death. Do you think I’m enjoying this? This is simply torturing; it is making me afraid that this will affect all the tasks I’ll carry out in the future, you know. Anyways, why are you here? Aren’t you always cultivating in seclusion in our Jingmen Island’s headquarters?”</p><p>The smile on Chi Nan’s face was getting thicker and she gave her a gentle hug. She tenderly smiled and said, “I can’t always be in seclusion for cultivation, can I? It’s natural to go out and get some fresh air. Never would I have thought that I would hear this interesting thing when I just returned to Shanghai, though.”</p><p>“Damn, you’re just gloating.” Hao Lei rolled her eyes and snappily replied.</p><p>“Why should I gloat over you?” Chi Nan replied with a tender smile, “I’m sympathizing with you. Hahaha…”</p><p>Hao Lei thought for a moment and said, “Well, how about I talk to Boss to give you the work here? It won’t be a problem as you’ll work on the behalf of Grand Fortune Jewelry. I only need to announce to the public that you’re the person they need to look for regarding the twelve zodiac jade carvings.”</p><p>“No no no!”</p><p>The smile on Chi Nan’s face froze as she waved again and again, “My good sister Lili, please let me go, will you? I’m not suitable to show my face to the public! Besides, the Boss has given the task to you and you’ve become a famous person, so how would I have the nerve to go against his words? Boss will scold us, definitely.”</p><p>“I’m so unlucky, sigh!” Hao Lei shook her head and sighed. “My goodness, Boss really has me to stand for him.”</p><p>“Anyways, Sis, what would Boss look for these twelve zodiac jade carvings for? 100 million US dollars for a piece is simply an astronomical price. Does he think that having too much money is a burden and simply wants to burn it?”</p><p>Hao Lei hesitated for a moment before she replied in a low voice, “I dunno much about this either, even Mo Awu doesn’t dare to ask about it. Nana, you are also well aware of Boss’s character, aren’t you? Don’t talk too much if he doesn’t want to tell us personally.”</p><p>“I know that,” replied Chi Nan quickly with a nod.</p><p>“Given what I know about him, he will never do things for no reason such as burning money, Nana. Even if he has made a fortune recently,” said Hao Lei, “I think he has a definitive purpose for this matter. Either that, or there is something about these zodiac jade carvings that is quite extraordinary, so the 100 million US dollars should be well-spent.”</p><p>“Yeah, Boss has never made a loss in business, that I know,” assented Chi Nan. “Anyways, you just said that he just struck a gold mine. What exactly is it?”</p><p>“Well, it can be said that it is due to the Salzburg vampire clan from Europe. They made a deal with him and Boss sold them a hundred medicinal pills,” answered Hao Lei with a smile. “You know what? They paid 200 million GBP for each, or paid with equivalent items and useful resources for cultivation.”</p><p>200 million GBP?</p><p>Despite knowing some significant big business transactions, Chi Nan was still shocked by the news. The deals she learned of in the past were worth tens of billions of Chinese yuan. But such a business deal with 200 million GBP for each pill for a total of two billion GBP was unheard of even to her.</p><p>“Sis Lili, is this vampire clan way too generous and easy to deceive? How come they actually spent so much just to buy a hundred medicinal pills? Are they so rich and so flustered to waste their money?”</p><p>“You see, the medicinal pills Boss took out are of enormous help to the vampires. I heard that Shanjenna, who used to live in the Paradise Club before, also benefitted from it greatly.” Hao Lei smiled.</p><p>Chi Nan suddenly understood and sighed, “The Bloodkin seem to stop at nothing to spend their capital for the sake of becoming stronger.”</p><p>At the entrance of Paradise Manor.</p><p>Yang Pengchao and Yue Li were panting after running. They hadn’t had breakfast, nor lunch, and the hot weather made them hungry, thirsty, and tired. Yang Pengchao held a black leather bag as he squeezed through the crowd of media workers outside with Yue Li to come to the gate blocked by dozens of security guards.</p><p>“You two, please show us the VIP membership card of Paradise Manor.”</p><p>Jin Shi, who temporarily served as the captain of the security guards, coldly looked at them and spoke.</p><p>Yang Pengchao and Yue Li exchanged glances and said with hesitation, “Hello, we don’t have VIP cards for your venue.”</p><p>“It doesn’t matter,” said Jin Shi. “You only need to pay two million and you can apply for a VIP membership cards of Paradise Manor. Of course, your money will also be saved in your VIP cards and you can spend it here.”</p><p>Two million yuan?</p><p>Yang Pengchao secretly smacked his tongue as he looked at the indifferent Jin Shi. He quickly turned to look at the hundreds of media workers nearby and then whispered, “Actually, we are here to sell some objects. Isn’t Hao Lei, the General Manager of Grand Fortune Jewelry, currently inside this Paradise Manor? We’re looking for her…”</p><p>Jin Shi’s expression immediately moved and he said, “Please come in with me, you two.”</p><p>Ten minutes later, Jin Shi had brought Yang Pengchao and Yue Li to the temporary VIP room and said, “I have just notified Manager Hao and she should be coming soon. You should rest here first.”</p><p>“Thanks,” said Yang Pengchao and Yue Li hurriedly.</p><p>Both of them came from the bottom of the society; how would they ever come to such a luxurious venue previously? They had been literally astonished along the way here. As Jin Shi left and they were the only people left in the several hundred square meter VIP room, Yang Pengchao turned to look at the tea table in front of the huge sofa with several fine cakes already served on it.</p><p>Growl…</p><p>Yang Pengchao’s stomach growled and he looked at Yue Li with embarrassment. Then he asked with hesitation, “Are you hungry? There are cakes, pastries, and tea on the table; you should eat them first if you’re hungry.”</p><p>Yue Li endured her hunger as she shook her head and said, “Let’s not eat them, shall we? If we were to eat them here and we need to pay, we’ll be…”</p><p>Yang Pengchao steeled his heart and interrupted her by pulling her to the sofa and took a seat. Then he grabbed two plates of cakes and drink and said, “It’s all right. As long as they buy my jade monkey, aren’t we going to have the money to spend here? Besides, you’re hungry and I can still afford to pay for these cakes and drinks even if the jade monkey isn’t sold later.”</p><p>“Alright, then,” said Yue Li while feeling warm inside as she received the plate and remained silent afterward.</p><p>Creak…</p><p>The VIP room’s door was opened and Hao Lei strode inside along with four burly experts of the Everlasting Feast Hall in black suits. When she saw them hurriedly standing up from the sofa while holding the plate of cakes and drinks, a look of surprise flashed in her eyes as she smiled at them and said, “How do you do, both of you? I’m Hao Lei, the General Manager of Grand Fortune Jewelry. I just heard that you have one of the twelve zodiac jade carvings; is this true?”</p><p>Yang Pengchao put the plate down. He was somewhat anxious upon seeing Hao Lei who had a dignified aura and came along with these cold-looking burly men in black suits, yet he still braced himself forward and replied, “That’s right, I have the jade monkey.”</p><p>“Please sit down. There’s no need to be nervous,” said Hao Lei with a smile.</p><p>“How may I address you, Mister?” asked Hao Lei smilingly.</p><p>“I’m Yang Pengchao and she’s Yue Li,” said Yang Pengchao in a hurry.</p><p>“Alright, Mr. Yang. You mentioned that you have the jade monkey. May I see it?” asked Hao Lei smilingly.</p><p>Yang Pengchao hesitated and didn’t take the jade monkey out immediately, but instead hurriedly inquired, “The newspaper said that you’re willing to pay 100 million US dollars to buy one of the twelve zodiac jade carvings, is this… is it true? If I give you the jade monkey, what if you don’t give me the money?”</p><p>“Pfft…” Hao Lei chuckled and said, “Little Brother, you don’t need to worry about that issue. The most important trait my Boss never lacks is his integrity and good faith. I’ll definitely pay you 100 million US dollars as long as the jade monkey you’ve brought is what my Boss needs. We’ll even keep your identity confidential for your safety.”</p><p>“Really?” Yang Pengchao was surprised.</p><p>“Our words are more precious than gold,” said Hao Lei with a nod.</p><p>While Yang Pengchao prepared to take out the jade monkey from the black leather bag, Yue Li, who was next to him, suddenly asked, “Sis Hao Lei, you just mentioned that the person who wants to buy the twelve zodiac jade carvings is your Boss? But I checked your information on the Internet; you’re supposed to be the General Manager of Grand Fortune Jewelry!”</p><p>“You’re still student, aren’t you?” Hao Lei smiled and said, “The term of General Manager and Big Boss are two different concepts. I’m only responsible for managing the Grand Fortune Jewelry as its General Manager, but I am not the owner, nor the Boss in a real sense. Of course, our Boss will meet you if your jade monkey is real.”</p><p>Yue Li suddenly understood and nodded in embarrassment.</p><p>Yang Pengchao took the jade monkey out from his bag and handed it over to Hao Lei. “This is the jade monkey. I bought it for 200 yuan before.”</p><p>“200 yuan?”</p><p>Hao Lei was dumbfounded as her eyes lingered on the jade monkey for a few minutes, then took it in her hands and carefully appraised it. She had seen the dragon and tiger jade carving from Tang Xiu and learned from him that each zodiac jade carving had a gray signet on its head.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
