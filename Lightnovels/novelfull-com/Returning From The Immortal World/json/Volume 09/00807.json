And also, a sealed demon stone, no less?</em></p><p>Tang Xiu stared fixedly at the black stone the size of his fist with a thumping heartbeat. He believed the small coffin made of demon stone he had found before did not belong to this world, so he decided to use it less once he absorbed the demonic power inside it.</p><p>At this moment, however, he finally realized that Earth may really have Demon Stone in existence somewhere, otherwise it wouldn’t have been possible for another piece to be present here. He needed Demon Stone, and if he had a steady supply of this stone he could completely enhance his physical strength and solidify it to the perfection of the first stage of Stars Tyrannical Body from the Heavenly Art of Cosmic Genesis cultivation.</p><p>“Family Head Ma, where did you get this ore?” asked Tang Xiu in a deep voice as he looked at Ma Jianfeng.</p><p>Ma Jianfeng thought about it and answered, “I can’t tell where we got it from specifically. My family has a lot of members and a lot of juniors obtain precious items from outside, then they give the items to the family in exchange for wealth or position. It’s just that this one left a bit of an impression, as it’s so strong that even a divine weapon can barely leave a mark on it.”</p><p>“Then I may have to trouble you for help to ask where this piece of ore came from,” said Tang Xiu after taking a deep breath. “If you can give a satisfactory answer, then I can help solve the old patriarch’s problem, or the Ma Family’s problem, for free.”</p><p>Ma Jianfeng’s face changed and he nodded without hesitation, “No problem. I’ll check it out immediately.”</p><p>Half an hour later, however, Ma Jianfeng returned with a dejected look. He wryly smiled when he saw anticipation on Tang Xiu’s face and said, “I’ve asked and checked it out. The stone was brought by a member of Ma Family around 60 plus years ago from outside, but he didn’t leave any information about this ore. Also, he passed away more than 30 years ago.”</p><p>Tang Xiu nodded with disappointment. After collecting these 10 precious ores, he said, “Since the Ma’s problems are temporarily resolved, then I won’t stay for long. I’ll visit your family again within a year and completely solve your family’s Feng Shui structure problem then.”</p><p>“Alright, let me send you off.”</p><p>Ma Jianfeng respectfully walked Tang Xiu out of Ma Family manor. He watched the vrooming car leaving and then turned to look at the silent, stocky Ma Chengye, and thoughtfully said, “Second Uncle, this Tang Xiu is definitely not simple. We were lucky that we haven’t completely lost decorum with him, else I’m afraid that our family would be very miserable.”</p><p>“You’re right.” Ma Chengye nodded and said, “If he’s just a divine doctor, there’s indeed no need for us to pay that much importance towards him, yet he’s also a Feng Shui master, which is rather extraordinary. Regardless of in this era or in ancient times, who dares to offend a Feng Shui master? In case that one’s provoked such people, they will definitely arrange an evil Feng Shui diagram on the offender’s ancestral tombs, which will invisibly kill them. Jianfeng, your fourth son is way too outrageous, and it occurred to me that you must severely punish him to give warnings to the others.”</p><p>Ma Jianfeng himself had already been disappointed with his fourth son, and he heavily said, “That little bastard almost ruined our family, and I’ll severely punish him over this matter. I may have to trouble you to kick that brat to the ancestral hall for 3 years, so as to make him repent and turn a new leaf, Second Uncle. Also, we must spread the news that Tang Xiu is an honorable guest of our family. Whoever dares see him as an enemy will be enemies with our Ma Family.”</p><p>Ma Chengye, however, looked hesitant and argued, “Don’t you think your decision is rather rash? We have yet to completely check Tang Xiu’s background.”</p><p>A smile appeared on Ma Jianfeng’s dignified face as he replied, “I just received a message 10 minutes ago. Can you guess what his identity is?”</p><p>“What is it?” asked Ma Chengye quickly while staring at him.</p><p>“He’s an offspring of the Tang Family who was separated and lived outside for many years,” answered Ma Jianfeng. “It is said that the Tang Family’s old patriarch is very fond of him. You must know that he usually has a group of experts with him. I’ve asked the bodyguards of my fourth son and finally determined that there’s at least one martial arts grandmaster among Tang Xiu’s men.”</p><p>“Martial arts grandmasters working for others?” Ma Chengye was struck dumb. He immediately nodded and said, “It should be correct, as only a family such as the Tangs can have such a great ability to send martial arts grandmasters to protect him.”</p><p>That night the news of Ma Family’s fourth son, Ma Xiaorong, being badly beaten and then severely punished by his family was spread quickly throughout Tianjing, and even several neighboring cities. A certain number of people with status and ability also obtained the news that the Mas were on friendly terms with Tang Xiu.</p><p>Tang Xiu! They had heard this name before as the young miracle-working doctor from Star City Chinese Medical Hospital in Shuangqing province. There had been much news and coverage in various media channels about him.</p><p>****</p><p>Mingyuan Resort.</p><p>Ren Qi was listlessly nesting on the soft couch, quietly watching the news broadcast on the TV. Although he didn’t work in the bureaucracy system, and there was no need for him to know some important political contents in the news, he still persevered on watching it because his father had instilled this habit of watching news from an early age.</p><p>Knock, knock…</p><p>A pretty young woman in a tulle skirt was at the door. She waltzed in with a lotus-like manner as her steps brought her in front of Ren Qi, and she smilingly said, “Hey, what have you been thinking about? You just keep watching the news, and yet your mind is somewhere else…”</p><p>“I just received the news, you know.” Ren Qin forced a smile and said, “It’s said that Fourth Ma just bumped into a solid iron sheet and is currently being punished by his elders, and it’s quite severe at that. We won’t be seeing him in the next three years.”</p><p>“Ehh?” The young woman was surprised. “What exactly happened? Isn’t Ma Jianfeng, that Ma Family’s head, always doting on him so much?”</p><p>“I dunno about the details,” Ren Qi shook his head and said, “But this is definitely related to Tang Xiu. Because shortly after the Ma Family spread out the news that Fourth Ma is being severely punished, further news had it that they are on very friendly terms with Tang Xiu, and whoever sees Tang Xiu as an enemy will become an enemy of Ma Family as well.”</p><p>“Those Ma Family’s old foxes can release such news?” The young woman was shocked. “It seems like they really have a very close relationship with Tang Xiu.”</p><p>“It could be, but I might have made a bit of a mistake here myself, though.” Ren Qi bitterly smiled.</p><p>“Why is that?” asked the young woman.</p><p>“You see, Tang Xiu came to our Mingyuan Resort today, but I didn’t even recognize him that time,” explained Ren Qi. “Little did I think that he’s that young Divine Doctor Tang Xiu. Also, there’s something you may not have learned. He’s also the secret Big Boss behind the Magnificent Tang Corp, and I’ve sent people to investigate something. He… he’s a junior of the Tang Family of Beijing, and one of the Tangs’ old patriarch’s most doted upon juniors no less.”</p><p>“Even if he has a very powerful background and identity, and you didn’t recognize him; what gives, though?” The young woman was still surprised.</p><p>“Sigh… You don’t understand.” Ren Qi shook his head and sighed. “He’s Long Zhenglin’s Brother and they have a very good relationship. If I can make a good relationship with Tang Xiu, for the sake of Long Zhenglin’s face, it will bring about great benefits not only for me but also for our Ren Family in the future. Don’t forget the fact that the Tang Family is a superfamily, which is one of the best in all of China.”</p><p>“This…” The young woman was also an astute person and understood everything instantly. Despite having no interest in networking and the benefits it could provide, she could still see that Ren Qi had just missed a great opportunity.</p><p>****</p><p>Shanghai.</p><p>After Tang Xiu returned from Tianjing, he immediately packed up his stuff and set off to Jingmen Island by overnight train. He bought a sleeping bag so he could pass the night sleeping, and when he changed transport and boarded the ferry he would arrive at Jingmen Island at noon.</p><p>On this occasion, Tang Xiu didn’t bring Mo Awu and the rest because he only earned one quota to enter the three-star vestige, thus he had no way to bring Mo Awu and ordered him to stay in Shanghai. Before leaving, however, he had already informed those close to him of his whereabouts but only told them that he would have a long trip. He didn’t tell them his destination.</p><p>****</p><p>Jingmen Island.</p><p>In the remote small port to the southeast, dozens of old fishing boats were on the shore with many fishermen smelling of fish. Wang Xiaodong had his own fishing boat, and he always went fishing in the sea diligently during this season, and then traded his hauls with fishmongers.</p><p>However, there was no indication of going out to see today despite the good weather and shining sun. He lazily laid on the deck of his fishing boat, resting his head on his hands’ pillow, knocking his legs while watching the busy figures of the familiar people around him. Occasionally, a few fishermen came skimping with him merrily, and he responded perfunctorily.</p><p>“Are you Wang Xiaodong?”</p><p>A group of four people, two men and two women, stopped on the shore as the stocky middle-aged man among them asked him.</p><p>Wang Xiaodong squinted and looked at him, and then immediately sprung up after having seen the person clearly. His eyes wandered away towards the two tall, beautiful women and shouted, “Yeah, I’m Wang Xiaodong. Who are you? Anything I can do for you?”</p><p>“I’m Zhu Long.”</p><p>The stocky Zhu Long jumped on the bow deck and took a stack of hundred-yuan bills from his chest pocket, throwing it to Wang Xiaodong. “The deposit has been transferred to your bank card via the bank. I believe you’ve received it. You are crystal clear about our purpose and deal. We’ll wait until our people arrive and then leave.”</p><p>With eyes lit up, Wang Xiaodong visually counted the stack of hundred-yuan bills in his hand and estimated that it should be at least 10,000 yuan. With the thought that he just struck gold in mind, he happily put away the money and asked, “Zhu… Big Bro Zhu Long, right? Well, easy money to get rich. I’m glad to serve you. Anyway, I already have all the things prepped, such as rations and water enough for us for 10 to 15 days at sea. By the way, how many people are going with you, exactly? My fishing boat can only take on a few people. Including the four of you, this babe can only accommodate 10 more.”</p><p>“There’s only one person left,” said Zhu Long indifferently.</p><p>Wang Xiaodong looked relaxed immediately and asked again, “So pray tell, Big Bro Zhu Long… You go to the sea this time to enjoy the magnificence of the ocean, right? I mean, looking at your demeanor and the attire you four are wearing, you all should be quite rich, but why would you rent my fishing boat instead of renting a luxury yacht?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
