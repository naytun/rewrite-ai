Numerous people in Tianjing could be said to have visited him, and the Ma Family was no exception. He also had been acquainted, and had a good relationship with, Ma Jianfeng, the Head of Ma Family for 20 years.</p><p>Therefore, Jiang Kun knew perfectly well about Ma Jianfeng’s situation, including his good-for-nothing son. People said that dragons would beget dragons and phoenixes would give birth to phoenixes, yet a rat that made a hole was enough to drain one’s wealth. He really wondered how such a powerful and capable man as Ma Jianfeng could beget such a lame duck.</p><p>Sigh…</p><p>Jiang Kun sighed and was about to bid farewell, when he seemed as if he was struck by lightning. His complexion suddenly changed as two names popped up into his mind: Star City and Tang Xiu?</p><p>His pace came to an abrupt halt as he came to and stood in front of Ma Xiaorong, finally asking, “Where did you say this Tang Xiu is coming from?”</p><p>His question made Ma Jianfeng’s expression slightly changed, as well as the faces of the tens of Ma Family’s core members standing nearby.</p><p>“Who knows which hell this bastard is from?” answered Ma Xiaorong indignantly.</p><p>“SHUT UP! Just answer your Uncle Jiang’s question,” Ma Jianfeng yelled angrily. “What’s this Tang Xiu’s background?”</p><p>“Didn’t you just tell me to shut up?!” Ma Xiaorong muttered, yet still conscientiously replied, “I really don’t know what his origin is. I only know that he’s with Long Zhenglin, the second son of the Long Family from Star City.”</p><p>Jiang Kun thought for a moment and asked, “How old is he? What does he look like? Does he have any particular feature?”</p><p>“He’s around 21-plus years old and very handsome, though he’s not as handsome as me. But I didn’t pay attention to any particular features he has.”</p><p>You, handsome? Handsome my ass! You look even worse than a pig right now!</p><p>Jiang Kun furiously cursed in his mind a few times before he turned to look at Ma Jianfeng. “I have seen Tang Xiu’s photo, and he does look handsome and looks like a 20 something-year-old. You should have a smartphone, right? Just browse the internet and search his name.”</p><p>Ma Jianfeng frowned. He immediately took out his mobile phone to search Tang Xiu’s information online and quickly found Tang Xiu’s photo. He handed the phone to Ma Xiaorong and shouted, “Look at this photo; is it him?”</p><p>Ma Xiaorong took a glance and immediately replied, “Yes. That’s the punk. He’s the one who made me like this.”</p><p>Slap…</p><p>Ma Jianfeng fiercely slapped Ma Xiaorong’s face hard, beating him to the ground. He even kicked Ma Xiaorong several times in front of everyone and furiously shouted, “You bastard! How can I have such a wastrel bastard son like you? Do you fucking know who he is? He’s Tang Xiu, the young Divine Doctor! Your grandpa is still waiting for him to save his life! AND YOU… Yet you actually have a conflict with him?! I’ll kill you, you bastard!”</p><p>Several elders of the Ma Family hurriedly stopped him, but one of them was still exasperated at this young chap’s atrocious demeanor and scolded, “You son of a bitch! You’re really are a good-for-nothing wastrel who creates troubles everywhere. Never did I expect that you’d poke a hornet’s nest today. I would have beaten you up just as bad, if your father didn’t just now!”</p><p>Ma Xiaorong was perplexed, and even dumbfounded by the cursing.</p><p>“W… W-what happened to grandpa?” asked Ma Xiaorong, covering his red cheek while he sat weakly on the ground.</p><p>His question, however, simply added fuel to the flames of the anger of the Ma Family’s tens of core members, even some of whom were nearly unable to hold their urge to beat him to death. The old patriarch was seriously ill, and all the core members of the Ma Family had received a notice, while Ma Xiaorong himself had received several calls and texts about it, but he didn’t see any of them?</p><p>Yet, just now… he even had the face to ask what happened to the old patriarch?</p><p>Several members of the family were holding Ma Jianfeng, but the anger on his face became more intense. He took a deep, heavy breath a few times and snarled loudly, “Starting today, cut off all allowance for this bastard; also, take back all of his cars and outside properties! Anyone in the family who dares to help him secretly will be expelled from this family forever. And spread the news to all of his crook friends outside, whoever dares to give him credit or lend him money will be regarded as the Ma Family’s enemy. And they better be prepared to face the Ma Family’s wrath!”</p><p>“Big Brother!” hastily cried out Ma Xiaorong’s paternal aunt.</p><p>Ma Jianfeng still roared resolutely, “Don’t even think to persuade me! Whoever dares to do so then get the hell out of the family! This good-for-nothing asshole has always made trouble. If we can’t discipline him, he will become the source of disaster to our family in the future!”</p><p>In that instant, everyone fell into silence. Ma Jianfeng had absolute authority in the family, so no one dared to risk his ire at this time.</p><p>Taking a deep breath again, Ma Jianfeng turned around and ordered, “Track Tang Xiu immediately! He happens to be in Tianjing, so you must find him as quickly as possible. Do remember not to startle him after you find him. I’ll see him personally to apologize to him.”</p><p>Several core members of Ma Family immediately left in a hurry.</p><p>****</p><p>Tang Xiu and Long Zhenglin rushed to the residential area where Long Zhenglin lived after leaving Mingyuan Resort. Tang Xiu urgently hoped that Long Zhenglin would hurry to Qingcheng Mountain to find the whereabouts of the Red Silk Flower.</p><p>“Anyway, I need to return to Shanghai and will hasten to Jiangmen Island tomorrow morning. You must get that Red Silk Flower regardless of the price. If that man really doesn’t want to sell it, however, do not push things, but stay close to him. I’ll contact you as soon as I return, and we’ll find another way later.”</p><p>“Got it.” Long Zhenglin nodded.</p><p>Tang Xiu patted his shoulder and said, “Just leave Tianjing as fast as possible. That Fourth Ma chap is kinda rotten, so don’t provoke him for now. We’ll come back and slowly clean him up after I’m done with my things.”</p><p>“Sure. I believe in your ability, Big Bro.” Long Zhenglin grinned. “Alright, less explaining and just hurry back to Shanghai then! I’ll pack my things and will rush to Qingcheng Mountain.”</p><p>“Alright!” concurred Tang Xiu as he turned and sat back in the car.</p><p>Half an hour later, when Mo Awu was driving on the highway, he glanced at the rearview mirror and reported, “Two cars have been following us for ten minutes or so, Boss.”</p><p>Tang Xiu looked back and apathetically said, “Ignore them for now. If they are from the Ma Family and dare to attack us on the way back, there’s no need to refrain.”</p><p>“Understood!” Mo Awu nodded.</p><p>However, two black SUVs behind them suddenly picked up speed, and then gradually decelerated after overtaking the car driven by Mo Awu. The two cars blocked the road in front of them on the right and left sides. Just as Mo Awu was preparing to change lanes, the window of one of the cars suddenly opened, and a stocky middle-aged man’s head poked out, waving his hand toward the back and gesturing for them to park on the roadside.</p><p>“Stop the car!” ordered Tang Xiu immediately.</p><p>Mo Awu parked the car on the roadside. He went straight to the rear door and stood. He watched the two cars stopped in front of them. After a while, four middle-aged men came over, and he talked to them indifferently, “What do you want?”</p><p>“Excuse me; is Divine Doctor Tang in the car?” asked the first middle-aged man.</p><p>“Who are you?” asked Mo Awu, pressing his brows.</p><p>“I’m Ma Jiandong of Ma Family,” replied the middle-aged man smilingly. “The Head of Ma Family, Ma Jianfeng, is my eldest brother. I was sent with a command from him to politely invite Divine Doctor Tang to visit our family. Also, eldest brother is currently on the way, and he should arrive here within half an hour.”</p><p>Tang Xiu opened the window to look at Ma Jiandong outside and lightly said, “The Ma Family invite me to visit your residence; do you perhaps want to hold a Hong Men banquet?”</p><p>Ma Jiandong clearly understood the meaning behind Tang Xiu’s word and forced a wry smile. “You’ve misunderstood it, Divine Doctor Tang. The Ma Family absolutely have no intention to murder our invited, honored guest. The reason we are inviting you is that my brother would like to apologize to you in person, in the hopes that you, in your benevolence, will forgive my nephew’s wrongdoings.”</p><p>A gleam flashed in Tang Xiu’s eyes.</p><p><em>‘If they didn’t have a plan to hold a banquet to murder the invited guest, then why would they make such a big parade just to invite me? Could it be that the Ma Family have something they want from me? Also, this man addressed me as ‘Divine Doctor Tang’. Could it be that there’s someone ill in the Ma Family, so they need me to treat that person?’</em></p><p>“I’m sorry. I don’t want to be involved with the Ma Family, nor do I care about what happened,” replied Tang Xiu indifferently. “If you just want to apologize, don’t delay and waste my time.”</p><p>“Divine Doctor Tang, we… we actually would like to request something from you,” said Ma Jiandong hastily.</p><p>“Then say it. I’m in a hurry and must return to Shanghai,” said Tang Xiu.</p><p>Ma Jiandong hesitated for a while and bitterly said, “In fact, it’s about my father. He’s seriously ill, and I want to invite Divine Doctor Tang to treat and heal him. The vice chairman of Tianjing Chinese Medicine Association, Jiang Kun, is a good friend of my eldest brother’s, and he recommended you to us. He thinks you can save my father with your outstanding medical expertise.”</p><p>“I don’t have time,” Tang Xiu flatly refused.</p><p>“Please see it as a humble request of our Ma Family, Divine Doctor Tang,” Ma Jiandong pleaded. “Please save my father, for the sake of showing our filial piety to him! My eldest brother said that we are willing to pay anything as long as… you can cure my father’s illness.”</p><p>“In case I disagree, then what? You won’t let me go?” sneered Tang Xiu.</p><p>Ma Jiandong was stunned and looked hesitant for a while before he forced a bitter smile. “Divine Doctor Tang, my eldest brother did give me a death decree to keep you here no matter what. But I will kowtow to you if you want me to, as long as you can stay and wait for him to see you.”</p><p>Tang Xiu was silent for a short while and lightly said, “This is not the place to stay for a long time. Let’s just go to the service area in front! I see your filial piety, so I won’t embarrass you, rest assured!”</p><p>“Thank you! Thank you, Divine Doctor Tang!”</p><p>Ma Jiandong was overjoyed and immediately returned to the two cars in the front with the other three middle-aged men. They started the car and drove ahead.</p><p><strong>Hongkang Highway Service Area</strong></p><p>After waiting for 20 minutes plus, several cars arrived quickly. A group of people got out from the cars, as the Head of Ma Family, Ma Jianfeng, rushed to the front and came over to the car where Tang Xiu was riding.</p><p>“Are you… Divine Doctor Tang?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
