After saying everything she needed to convey, she left in a hurry and came to suite 1206. When she saw her older sister Zhang Xinya’s red eyes and her despondent state, she felt distressed despite having mentally prepared for it.</p><p>“Xinyue, why did you come here?”</p><p>Although Zhang Xinya was in a depressed mood, she was still surprised upon seeing her young sister catch up with her in Qinglin County and appear before her. After she asked, however, she suddenly realized that Zhang Xiaoyu must have called her younger sister about her situation here, or else she wouldn’t rush to come.</p><p>Zhang Xinyue gently grabbed Zhang Xinya’s hand and softly said, “Sis, please let everything go.”</p><p>“I can’t.”</p><p>“Please give it some time, alright?”</p><p>Zhang Xinya sighed gloomily. But she immediately shifted the topic to avoid causing her sister more agony, “Sis, take a look at your face now. How will you participate in the opening ceremony of that villa complex tomorrow? How about I take your place?”</p><p>“No can do. Those people have paid me a lot. I may be not in a good shape, but I can adjust my condition by then,” refused Zhang Xinya hurriedly.</p><p>“What they want is your fame—for you to appear there. We’re almost identical both in height and appearance, so there won’t be a problem if I attend the show instead of you.” Zhang Xinyue shook her head and said, “Besides, do you think my singing is inferior to yours?”</p><p>“You sing really well and no one can tell who is who unless they are particularly familiar with us, but…” said Zhang Xinya.</p><p>“Sis, can you please listen to me first?” Zhang Xinyue interrupted her and said, “Just have a look at your eyes now. They are all red and swollen and you’re in a depressed state. If you were still to attend the opening ceremony tomorrow, some unfavorable situation will definitely occur. Let’s talk seriously, shall we? If a situation occurs while you’re in the middle of a show, it’s going to have a big impact on your reputation. The gossip news will be very eager to get the scoop and will cover your scandal. Instead of giving them a chance to fabricate gossips and slander you, it would be better for me to take over your show for this event.”</p><p>“This…” Zhang Xinya hesitated.</p><p>“Alright, let’s just decide as such.” Zhang Xinyue smiled and said, “That’s right, have you had lunch? I drove over all night long, so I’m starving and need to fill my empty belly.”</p><p>“I’ll call someone from the hotel restaurant to send the meals now,” said Zhang Xinya quickly.</p><p>The next day.</p><p>When Tang Xiu had just finished breakfast and came to the lobby of the 5-star Senbao Hotel, Zhang Xinyue, who wore a mask, sunglasses, and a black windbreaker, stood in the corner of the rest area with Zhang Xiaoyu. Once they saw him, they quickly came to greet him.</p><p>“You are…”</p><p>Tang Xiu was able to distinguish Zhang Xinya and Zhang Xinyue if he carefully observed them, but at this moment, he was having trouble since the woman was currently wearing a mask and sunglasses.</p><p>“Mr. Tang, let’s go together since you’ll also attend the opening ceremony of the Golden Goblet Emperor Gauze villa complex,” said Zhang Xinyue with a smile.</p><p>“It seems you really have a way to convince your sister, huh,” replied Tang Xiu and smiled back. “But if you wanna go with me, you’ll have to follow me in seeing my friend first since I’ll go with him later.”</p><p>“You have friends here?” Zhang Xinyue was surprised.</p><p>“What’s wrong? Can’t I have friends here?” asked Tang Xiu with a smile.</p><p>“I don’t mean that. I’m just curious why you came to Qinglin County.” Zhang Xinyue quickly waved and said, “Alright then. It’s fine if you take me to go see your friend. We all can directly go to where the show is being held.”</p><p>Tang Xiu looked hesitant for a moment before he nodded and said, “If so, let’s do that!”</p><p>Zhang Xinyue didn’t take her sister’s bodyguard’s car but took Tang Xiu’s car instead, followed by Zhang Xiaoyu, who was now her temporarily personal assistant and took the front seat.</p><p>“Big guy, drive slowly. Xinyue Big Sis is prone to motion sickness.”</p><p>Mo Awu just squinted a glance at Zhang Xiaoyu and started the car without uttering a word, then quickly drove toward Wang Tao’s residence.</p><p>10 minutes later, the car stopped in front of the gate of Wang Tao’s residence. As Tang Xiu and Zhang Xinyue came to the courtyard, Wang Tao was already outside in a bubbly mood.</p><p>“Huh?”</p><p>When Wang Tao saw Zhang Xinyue, his eyes turned round like beads. Only after Zhang Xinyue came to him with Tang Xiu did he finally come back to his senses, as if he was awakening from a dream. He stretched his hand out in a hurry and said, “Hello, Miss Xinya, I’m Wang Tao. Wang Xuegang is my father, and the villa complex Golden Goblet Emperor Gauze is real estate developed by our family.”</p><p>There was a disgusted look gleaming in Zhang Xinyue’s eyes, though it was concealed well. She didn’t shake hands with Wang Tao but turned to look at Tang Xiu.</p><p>Wang Tao’s lecherous nature and his womanizer conduct was something that Tang Xiu had long heard of, so he said with a smile, “My, my, you ignore me directly when you see a belle, huh? And you told me that we are good friends.”</p><p>Wang Tao stared blankly and immediately took back his hand before letting out a hollow, dry laugh. He looked at Tang Xiu and said, “Please don’t get offended, Big Bro Tang. Everyone loves a beautiful woman, and this is my first-time seeing Miss Xinya, so feeling attracted to her is kinda normal, no? Anyhow, let’s go and have a chat inside.”</p><p>“Let’s spare the chat inside, shall we? Just use the time to take your herbal medication. Besides, we need to rush to the Golden Goblet Emperor Gauze villa complex. If my guess is correct, they should be prepared there,” said Tang Xiu.</p><p>Wang Tao thought for a moment and replied, “Alright then. We can still have a chat on the way there.”</p><p>With that said, however, he still couldn’t help but be overcome by his urge to glance at Zhang Xinyue before making a quick turn to run into his villa.</p><p>Zhang Xinyue took back her gaze from Wang Hao’s back and whispered, “I don’t like him. His eyes are full of lust. This person is not a good man.”</p><p>“He just said that everyone has the heart to love beautiful women, didn’t he?” said Tang Xiu indifferently. “Who makes your appearance look so beautiful? It’s normal for people to look at you more and more. But as you said it, this brat is indeed a notch more lascivious than normal people. Just keep a distance from him if you don’t like him.”</p><p>“I’ll keep a distance from him, but I have to correct your statement, mind you.” Zhang Xinyue nodded.</p><p>“What statement?” Tang Xiu was puzzled.</p><p>“Everyone has the heart to love a beautiful woman, but this sentence proves that you’re wrong because I’m standing next to a different kind of man,” said Zhang Xinyue.</p><p>“Cough, cough…” Tang Xiu coughed and no longer touched the topic.</p><p>The villa complex Golden Goblet Emperor Gauze.</p><p>The winding road was very wide and was connected to the road with a magnificent gate at the foothill of the highest peak on the outskirts of Qingcheng Mountain. The gate was more than 30 meters in height and width while more than ten security guards in black uniforms were checking the passes on travelling cars.</p><p>At present, two middle-aged men were sitting on a black Buick sedan while looking at the driver’s registration number and the car’s information. After taking the Buick sedan slowly into the gate, one of them slowly said, “Wang Xuegang’s eldest brother is the Deputy Abbot of Qingcheng Monastery, a real power figure of the school. Since we’re going to uproot the Qingcheng Monastery, let’s just kill him in passing!”</p><p>Another middle-aged man with a hideous scar on his cheek squinted his eyes and said, “You’re right. Six of our brothers died to the hands of the Qingcheng Monastery, whereas us four kinda escaped by a fluke. Now that we’re here for revenge, let’s play it bigger and kill them all. But there are too many people and a lot more eyes mixed in with them, so we’ll need to carefully consider the number and how to do it.”</p><p>“There’s no need to think it over. I brought some Drunken Dragon Powder.”</p><p>“What?” Scarface gasped in shock, “Bai Zhen, did you entrust Miao Wentang to buy Drunken Dragon Powder from that foreign toxicologist? And you even brought it here? Don’t tell me you wanna use the Drunken Dragon Power on these normal people too? It’s too wasteful. You’re just killing a chicken using an oxen’s butcher knife!”</p><p>“I know it’s a waste killing Wang Xuegang with Drunken Dragon Powder, but I won’t use too much of it,” sneered Bai Zhen. “As long as I put a tenth of the Drunken Dragon Powder for today’s banquet, that damned Wang Xuegang will drink a pot of them. Even if he’s lucky enough not to die, too many people will die here and bring him great trouble. Hehehe… then we’ll send some people in disguise as family members of the deceased to seek Wang Xuegang out for revenge. We’ll evacuate immediately after stabbing him to death so that it won’t attract the attention of outsiders.”</p><p>“What a scheme!” Scarface murmured, “If that’s the case, not only will we kill Wang Xuegang, but will also ruin his business. It seems that Wang Xuegang and his family are doomed to fall apart and die.”</p><p>Bai Zhen nodded and looked northward before coldly saying, “It’s been 24 years that we Brothers fell from that cliff. Yet, we actually had a fortuitous encounter that made us cultivators. We successfully become in-name disciples of the Poison Dao Master because of our good foundation. 24 years of penance and self-torture, all to avenge ourselves and cancel out our hatred. This time, we’ll completely annihilate the Qingcheng Monastery’s people!”</p><p>“We can be at ease with that!” Scarface sneered, “All the experts we have trained these years have already climbed up the mountain ahead of time. They will immediately kill the Qingcheng Monastery’s people once they receive our orders.”</p><p>Inside the villa complex of Golden Goblet Emperor Gauze, Wang Xuegang was waiting for the arrival of two distinguished guests inside the spacious office on the second floor of the three-storied sales center with a face full of expectation.</p><p>He had invited many people for this occasion, including the real power figures of Qinglin County’s government, department authorities, some city officials who held high office, and naturally, some of his cliques in the business community. Even Zhao Xianming, the chairman from the City Heavy Industry Group, had promised to attend the event in person.</p><p>“Boss, Boss Zhao is coming.”</p><p>A middle-aged woman strode into the room and looked at Wang Xuegang who was standing in front of the window.</p><p>Wang Xuegang turned and nodded as he replied, “I’ll come out to greet him immediately. Also, clean up VIP room 3. I’ll bring Boss Zhao over there.”</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Zhao Xianming was a big-bellied middle-aged man. His complexion was rather pale due to his drinking and womanizing habits, yet he was also the Big Boss of the largest company in the city with an extraordinary bearing, contrary to what might be expected. At this time, he was with several company owners at his side. As he saw Wang Xuegang come to greet him, he smiled and said, “It’s been a few months since the last time we met, Brother Wang. Yet, you’re still this spirited! That’s right, today is the opening sale ceremony of your Golden Goblet Emperor Gauze villa complex, isn’t it? Well, since you can expect a lot of banknotes flying into your pockets soon, it’s natural that you’d be a spirited and happy man, right, Brother Wang? Come, I’d like to congratulate you ahead of time.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
