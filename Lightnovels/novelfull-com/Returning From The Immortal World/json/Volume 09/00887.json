She smilingly said, “You guys don’t need to worry; I just appraised this jade monkey. If I’m correct, this is what my Boss is looking for—the jade monkey of twelve zodiac jade carvings. Of course, the final decision will be in the hands of my Boss, but he’ll immediately catch up soon. Once he has determined the authenticity, we’ll transfer 100 million US dollars to your account right away.”</p><p>“Great!” Yang Pengcaho exclaimed in surprise.</p><p>“Little Brother, I just heard you say that you bought this jade monkey for 200 yuan. Can you tell me about the situation?” asked Hao Lei smilingly.</p><p>“This…” Yang Pengcaho regretted when he said that. He was afraid that Hao Lei or her Boss wouldn’t give him that 100 million US dollars after knowing that he had only spent 200 yuan to buy it.</p><p>‘What comes will come, I guess. Even though they don’t give me the 100 million USD, I’m still willing to sell it as long as they can give me more than a million yuan.’</p><p>Yang Pengchao decided to set a price inwardly.</p><p>Immediately afterward, he looked at Yue Li and then said, “Actually, I’ve been crushing on Yue Li since high school. I had always wanted to gift her something on Valentine’s day, so I looked around for a gift. I originally wanted to buy something at a boutique or some novelty shop, but then I found this jade monkey on a roadside stall. I thought it was very beautiful, and it was priced at 200 yuan, so I bought it. But then… Yue Li was taking a leave of absence on that Valentine’s Day; hence, I couldn’t gift her this jade monkey. It has been on my bookcase in my house since.”</p><p>A trace of joy filled Yue Li’s eyes as she said, “You were… in high school…”</p><p>Yang Pengchao grabbed her hand and didn’t let it go even though she struggled twice. Then he nodded and said, “I’ve been crushing on you since junior high and even after you enrolled in the top high school in the county you are studying at now.”</p><p>Hao Lei watched the two eighteen-years-old teenagers in front of her. She could tell that their feelings were very real. She let out a faint smile and said, “You guys are really great and I can tell you like each other. Also, you truly have very good luck; to think that you can sell a 200-yuan object for 100 million US dollars, that is the blessing and care that Heaven has bestowed upon you. However, there are some words I’d like you to hear.”</p><p>Yang Pengchao and Yue Li hurriedly shifted their visions to Hao Lei. “Please do say!”</p><p>“I’ve seen too many couples who can share hardships and difficulties, yet are unable to do so when they get rich,” said Hao Lei. “If my Boss has appraised the jade monkey as a real one, you’ll have 100 million dollars, so you’ll become a millionaire. But I hope you won’t be blinded and confused by money and lose your most sincere and pure love because of it. You guys are still young and you haven’t understood what the greatest loss is. But I can tell you one thing; even if you have a hundred times more than 100 million US dollars, money and riches cannot necessarily buy true love.”</p><p>Yang Pengchao looked at Yue Li and then turned to Hao Lei and said, “I’ll forever keep your words in mind. As long as she doesn’t leave me in this life, I won’t give up on her either.”</p><p>Yue Li didn’t utter a word, yet her hands that grabbed Yang Pengchao’s gripped tighter.</p><p>It was four in the afternoon and Tang Xiu was rushing to the Paradise Manor. He asked Hao Lei where she was and soon caught up to the VIP room. To his surprise, the owner of the jade monkey was actually a couple younger than him.</p><p>“Boss, this is Yang Pengchao and she’s Yue Li.”</p><p>Hao Lei introduced them after greeting Tang Xiu.</p><p>Tang Xiu produced a faint smile and nodded at the duo as he said, “I’m very pleased to meet you; I’m Tang Xiu. I’m really hoping to buy the zodiac jade carving from its owner at a high price.”</p><p>Yang Pengchao was a bit surprised when he saw Tang Xiu since he felt that this person was familiar. But the most surprising thing for him was that this Boss was so young and seemed to be just a few years older than himself.</p><p>“You are Tang Xiu?” asked Yue Li with round eyes and disbelief.</p><p>“Do you perhaps know me, by chance?” asked Tang Xiu with a smile.</p><p>Yue Li’s small head nodded so fast like a chicken pecking on rice and quickly replied, “I’ve read and seen the news about you. You’re not only the renowned miracle-working doctor of Star City Chinese Medical Hospital, but also a real philanthropist. That’s right, I think you’re also the owner of the Magnificent Tang Corporation!”</p><p>At the side, Yang Pengchao suddenly came to his senses. He just thought that Tang Xiu looked familiar, but suddenly remembered his identity after the reminder from Yue Li. At this moment, he was still shocked and nervous even though he had entered society for two years and tempered himself with experience.</p><p>It was Tang Xiu, the idol he had been worshipping!</p><p>“You have good eyes. That’s right, that person is me,” said Tang Xiu with a smile.</p><p>“Idol, you… you have a heart of gold; could you save my mother?” asked Yue Li hurriedly.</p><p>“Come again?”</p><p>Tang Xiu was stunned. Didn’t he come here to buy the jade monkey? How come he turned into a rescuer now?</p><p>Yang Pengchan suddenly recalled the situation of Yue Lie’s mother and quickly said, “B-Boss… Tang, Yue Li’s mother currently has a very serious illness, leukemia. We came to Shanghai to sell the jade monkey for the sake of raising money to treat her mother.”</p><p>Tang Xiu was silent for a moment and nodded. “Alright, save my private cell number later and take your mother to Shanghai after you go back! Regardless of whether the jade monkey you bring here is what I need or not, I give you my word.”</p><p>“Thank you, thank you.” Yue Lie sobbed and burst into tears.</p><p>Tang Xiu shook his head and motioned for Hao Lei to give Yue Li a tissue. Then he said, “Calm down. We sill have important things to do now. Anyways, did you guys bring the jade monkey here?”</p><p>Yang Pengchao, who was somewhat moved by Tang Xiu’s decision, immediately replied, “That’s right, we brought it.”</p><p>Tang Xiu picked up the jade monkey and, after a few seconds, determined that it was the real jade monkey—one of the twelve zodiac jade carvings he was looking for. He felt joy inwardly and said to Hao Lei, “Give them a bank account and then transfer 100 million US dollars to them.”</p><p>“There’s no need for that, Boss Tang,” interjected Yang Pengchao quickly. “You don’t need to give us so much money as long as you can cure Yue Li’s mother. Just one… one million yuan is enough.”</p><p>“Oh?” Tang Xiu looked at him in surprise and asked, “Do you really want to give up the 100 million US dollars?”</p><p>There was a hesitation on Yang Pengchao’s face, yet he still firmly nodded and said, “I do. As long as you can cure her mother, that is.”</p><p>“Are you still a student?” asked Tang Xiu.</p><p>“I dropped out of high school.” Yang Pengchao shook his head and continued, “I’ve been working for two years in Zheng City now.”</p><p>“Do you know what 100 million US dollars would mean for you?” asked Tang Xiu again.</p><p>Yang Pengchao said, “I know, but I’m afraid…”</p><p>Tang Xiu let out a smile and walked to his front and smilingly said, “Anyways, are you interested in working under me later?”</p><p>Yang Pengchao blanked out after being caught off guard by Tang Xiu’s reply that was out of topic. He then replied, “What do you mean by working under you?”</p><p>“Well, I need smart people as well as those with good characters.” Tang Xiu chuckled and said, “Even if you have ten billion, it’s worthless in my eyes, but if you have good character, your value is more than 10 billion. So, as long as you agree and can be loyal to me in the future, I’ll give you the opportunity to have a rapid advance in your career.”</p><p>Yang Pengchao shook inwardly as though his heart was struck with a thunderbolt.</p><p>Who was Tang Xiu? He was an amazing great personage in China. Even his sole Magnificent Tang Corporation had tens of billions in assets.</p><p>Not only that, he had even checked the details about the Great Fortune Jewelry on the Internet. It was a large jewelry company with billions of assets. Yet now, it seemed that this industry was also owned by Tang Xiu. He simply couldn’t imagine how much other wealth Tang Xiu had that was unknown to the public.</p><p>However, to think that such an amazing great personage—the real super-rich would actually value him in such regard and also gave him the opportunity to fly…</p><p>“I’m willing,” said Yang Pengchao quickly with trembling lips.</p><p>Tang Xiu happily nodded and smilingly said, “Alright, give your bank account to Hao Lei, then! Wait for her to transfer 100 million US dollars into your account. Also, you seem to be very tired, so just stay in Paradise Manor to rest! I’ll send someone to prepare the room for you; the food, clothes, and accommodation are free of charge.”</p><p>Yang Pengchao was dumbfounded. He truly couldn’t understand why Tang Xiu would still include the 100 million US dollars. He hesitantly asked in order to understand, “Do you still want me to give me 100 million US dollars? Really?”</p><p>“I, Tang Xiu, have always put honesty as the greatest importance,” said Tang Xiu sternly. “I never go back on my words. You’re willing to sell me the jade monkey, so I must pay you 100 million dollars.”</p><p>With that said, he took the jade monkey and turned to head outside. After he was outside, he looked at Hao Lei who followed him and said, “Announce the news that we have found the jade monkey immediately. Because the seller wants to keep this a secret, we can’t announce his identity.”</p><p>“Understood,” said Hao Lei respectfully.</p><p>“There’s one other thing. Send someone to go back with them since Yue Li’s mother is going to Shanghai to see me. That way, it would be easy to tend to,” continued Tang Xiu.</p><p>“Well, Chi Nan just returned to Shanghai, Boss. Why not assign her to the task?” asked Hao Lei with a smile.</p><p>“Eh?” Tang Xiu was surprised, “Chi Nan came back? That’s good! Tell her to assign someone to make a trip and take care of the patient on the road.”</p><p>Inside the VIP room.</p><p>Yang Pengchao was still dizzy for a long while as he felt like he was in a dream. He muttered to himself, “Today is the most unreal day I’ve ever had since I was born. Yue Li, can you pinch me? I wanna feel that I’m not dreaming.”</p><p>Yue Li didn’t comply with his request and said with all seriousness, “You’re not dreaming. It’s all real. It’s just that we never thought that the real buyer would be Tang Xiu.”</p><p>Yang Pengchao looked at her and nodded, “I’m willing, even if he doesn’t give me a penny, as long as he can cure the illness of your mother. I feel its worth it as long as you’re willing to be my girlfriend and will marry me in the future.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
