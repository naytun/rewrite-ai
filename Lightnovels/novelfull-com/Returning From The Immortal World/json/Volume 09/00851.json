He tightly gripped his fists and crumpled the two notes.</p><p>“This unfilial son… got a venereal disease?”</p><p>The female’s expression changed and immediately said with solemnity, “Doctors also said that he has contracted a virus, but not venereal disease… however…”</p><p>“But what?” yelled Wang Xuegang.</p><p>“The virus is much more serious than a venereal one,” said the woman quickly. “Even some experts from large hospitals are helpless in how to treat it. But still… the person who wrote these two prescriptions for young master Wang may look a bit unreliable, but the young master ordered me to buy them, so I don’t dare to question it.”</p><p>Wang Xuegang snorted angrily and took the two prescriptions as headed into the courtyard gate. After he came to the villa’s living room, his eyes only glanced at Wang Hao before they were fixated on Tang Xiu.</p><p>“Are you the Chinese medical practitioner who wrote these two prescriptions?” asked Wang Xuegang in a deep voice as he stood in front of Tang Xiu while showing the two prescriptions.</p><p>Tang Xiu creased his brows and was about to reply, but Wang Tao hurriedly got up and loudly said, “Father, what are you doing? Big Brother Tang is my friend and not your men! Don’t talk to my friend with that attitude.”</p><p>Wang Xuegang turned his head and glared at him and then said, “SHUT UP! A kid wants to teach his father, huh? Hmph… you’re a wastrel who always wastes your time visiting brothels and even contracted a venereal disease, I’m not done with this issue; you’ll see how I’ll teach you a lesson later.”</p><p>Wang Tao’s face paled after getting reprimanded by his father in front of Tang Xiu. He couldn’t accept it and retorted loudly, “Do you know who this friend in front of me really is? It’s true that I contracted a virus due to my mistake. I can promise you that won’t mess up and be unruly in the future, but you can’t talk to my friend with that kind of attitude, can you?”</p><p>“Hmph, friend? What I see is just a fox, a liar! There have been too many conmen nowadays. You’re still too green and you’ll be swindled by him if I don’t keep you in check. Besides, look at his age, where does it look like someone who knows Chinese medicine?” sneered Wang Xuegang.</p><p>Tang Xiu got up and indifferently squinted at Wang Xuegang before he looked at the angry Wang Tao. Then he said apathetically, “I’m a swindler, huh? That indeed is true, it’s just that I didn’t expect it to be easily seen. Since your father thinks I don’t have the abilities and have the likes of a cheap conman, I can also leave.”</p><p>Wang Tao hurriedly stopped Tang Xiu and said with an apologetic expression, “Big Brother Tang, please don’t be angry. My Dad doesn’t know your identity.”</p><p>After saying that, he furiously looked at Wang Xuegang and said loudly, “Dad, I know that you always judge a book by its cover. But I can tell you for sure, Big Brother Tang Xiu is absolutely no swindler!”</p><p>“Big Brother Tang? Aren’t you much older than him? Why the hell should you address him as Big Brother?” Wang Xuegang’s anger was now mostly replaced with disbelief.</p><p>“That’s right, I must address him as Big Brother, though I’m in fact wanting to befriend him due to his high status,” retorted Wang Lao loudly. “Do you really not know him? Take a look at his face carefully; what company is the most famous nowadays in the country?”</p><p>Wang Xuegang was flabbergasted. This was his first time seeing his son unyielding and very angry with him. He tightly creased his brows and thought carefully for a while and then sneered, “There are tons of famous domestic companies nowadays, who the hell will know the one you’re talking about?”</p><p>“You know what? He’s Tang Xiu, the Big Boss of Magnificent Tang Corporation, and also the young divine doctor of Star City Chinese Medical Hospital!” said Wang Tao loudly, “Now tell me, Dad. Do you really think that someone like Big Brother Tang, who has such identity, will just visit my place to swindle me?”</p><p>Wang Xuegang was stunned and immediately took his mobile out to browse for the ‘Tang Xiu’ name and quickly found photos of the tagged keyword. His expression dramatically changed as he checked the photo and the man. There was a look of shock as well as disbelief on his face.</p><p>“It’s…”</p><p>Wang Xuegang wanted to speak, but was rendered speechless. He could have continued his attitude if he hadn’t discerned Tang Xiu’s identity, but the young man in front of him was indeed the Big Boss of the famous Magnificent Tang Corporation, as well as the young divine doctor of the Star City Chinese Medical Hospital. The revelation made him somewhat restless inside.</p><p>With a bit of a proud expression, Wang Tao said, “Dad, the fact is, Big Brother Tang came to me because of my Brother, but he’s still locked up to face the wall in the Qingcheng Monastery. Hence, he is staying here while administering my disease treatment. You also know brother’s status; Big Brother Tang and him are kind of good friends.”</p><p>Wang Rui’s friend?</p><p>Wang Xuegang finally understood why Tang Xiu, the Big Boss of the famous Magnificent Tang Corp, would come to such a small place like Qinglin City and appear in the residence of his wastrel son.</p><p>An awkward yet embarrassed expression instantly covered his face. He slapped his own lips, let out a dry cough and then hollowly smiled, “B… Boss Tang, I was really offensive just now because this wastrel son of mine contracted a venereal disease… Well, it’s all my fault, so please forgive my ignorance with your magnanimous heart. I’ve long heard about your famous and resounding name, and I’ve been wanting to pay you a visit for a long time. But I’m just a small time businessman, and I’ve been afraid that I don’t have the qualification, so…”</p><p>Tang Xiu just glanced at him coldly and detachedly said, “Wang Tao and I are like old friends at our first meeting; we have become good friends due to that. I won’t take this matter to heart since you’re his father, not to mention that you’ve figured out my identity as the young divine doctor from the Star City Chinese Medical Hospital. Those big hospitals may not be able to cure him, but not me. If you don’t want to delay your son’s harrowing condition, send someone to buy the herbs according to those prescriptions.”</p><p>“Yes, yes.”</p><p>Wang Xuegang hurriedly called the female he came in with and handed her the two prescriptions and urged, “Hurry to get the medicine and buy the best herbs, you hear?”</p><p>The female, who was previously skeptical about Tang Xiu’s Chinese medicine doctor status, felt rather incredulous. However, she was also finally aware that this young man turned out to have a very high stature and should be someone that her Boss couldn’t afford to provoke. She didn’t dare to delay after receiving the two prescriptions and hurriedly left.</p><p>Then, Wang Xuegang turned around to see Tang Xiu and smilingly said, “You’re really a great man, Boss Tang. Someone with a great mind and integrity who is worth learning from. It’s just I’m curious about something; may I know why you want to see my nephew?”</p><p>Wang Tao hurriedly called out, “DAD…”</p><p>Tang Xiu raised his hand to interrupt him and lightly said, “You’re Wang Tao’s father and a member of Wang Family, so I won’t hide it from you. Wang Rui saved one of my people in the South China Sea some time ago. It’s the reason why I came here: to express my gratitude. Moreover, I’m not only the owner of Magnificent Tang Corporation or the young divine doctor of Star City Chinese Medical Hospital—I’m also a cultivator. I don’t think that many people are aware of the term or what being a Daoist cultivator means, but you’re a member of the Wang Family, so you should be very clear, no?”</p><p>“Daoist cultivator?”</p><p>Wang Xuegang’s eyes grew as big as a saucer and he exclaimed as he backtracked a few steps in shock.</p><p>“I told you this fact because of my relationship with Wang Rui,” said Tang Xiu indifferently. “But I hope this issue will never be known to anyone other than you two.”</p><p>Wang Xuegang hurriedly waved his hand and replied, “It won’t happen! Only the three of us will know this. We—father and son, will never tell another soul!”</p><p>“Alright, you don’t need to worry about Wang Tao’s illness.” Tang Xiu nodded and said, “I guarantee that he will recover to his best in 7 days. I’ll have to concoct and administer the medicine to him later, so you can leave if you have nothing else.”</p><p>Seeing Tang Xiu’s indifferent attitude towards him, Wang Xuegangg was truly regretting what he did inwardly. However, how would he be willing to miss such an opportunity to make friends with this hard to see great personage? He let out an obsequious smile and said, “Boss Tang, I actually came over to this place for a few reasons. First, I wanted to see how my wastrel son has been doing recently, and the second reason is to bring him over to participate in the opening sale ceremony of our Golden Goblet Emperor Gauze villa complex. Having you visiting Qinglin County is an honor for our county, so I wonder whether you can also honor us to attend the opening sale ceremony of our villa complex later?”</p><p>“I’m not interested,” flatly refused Tang Xiu.</p><p>He did have no sliver of interest in coming to the opening sale ceremony of this villa complex. One of the reasons was because of Zhang Xinya, whom Wang Xuegang had invited to come. He didn’t want to meet her in Qinglin County.</p><p>Wang Xuegang was a bit embarrassed, but he still smiled and turned his head to his son and sent him a signal with his eyes. He even made up his mind that he would spare the lesson he was going to teach his son for being infected by the venereal disease if this brat was able to make Tang Xiu pleased.</p><p>Wang Tao also had similar thoughts at this moment. Now that his father winked at him, he suddenly realized that an opportunity ‘to render meritorious deeds to redeem his mistakes’ had just come. He hurriedly smiled obsequiously and said, “Big Brother Tang, you’re my brother, while my family is also about to have a big and happy event. You really must give me face and come with us together. I know that my Dad was wrong; please don’t be angry with him.”</p><p>A surprising light gleamed in Tang Xiu’s eyes. He hesitated before replying, “To be honest, I just forgot some other matters of why I really can’t attend the opening sale ceremony of your villa complex. It’s because I must go to the Qingcheng Monastery to look for Wang Rui. Firstly, it’s to send him the healing medicine and personally thank him, while secondly, there’s something that I need him to help with.”</p><p>“Help on what issue, exactly?” Wang Tao was confused.</p><p>“It’s not a big deal, in fact,” said Tang Xiu casually. “I heard that the Qingcheng Mountain has so many precious herbs of various types. My cultivation has kind of reached a bottleneck recently, so I need 2 kinds of precious herbs.”</p><p>Wang Hao wore a look of delight and replied without hesitation, “Big Brother Tang, as long as those herbs are within Qingcheng Mountain, I’ll help you find them. What are those two magical herbs you need?”</p><p>“You really can help me?” asked Tang Xiu, hesitating.</p><p>“Of course, I can!” said Wang Tao proudly. “You see, I forgot to tell you that my Dad used to be a very famous barefoot doctor in the surrounding areas. He once healed a certain great man from another big city of his sickness. I am also able to identify many herbs due to his edification and influence, so I even organize an annual event to send people to seek precious herbs in the mountain and then send those herbs to Qingcheng Monastery to exchange them with some good things from there.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
