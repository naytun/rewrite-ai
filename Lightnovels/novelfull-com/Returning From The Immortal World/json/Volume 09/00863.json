Except  for his women… he has never touched other women.”</p><p>“But where are we now, mind you?” yelled Xue Sha angrily. “The  aphrodisiac that can make him lose consciousness is absolutely not a  joke. It will ruin him or even might kill him if we delay more.”</p><p>Mo Awu fell into silence. He was never afraid to cross any line  should it concern the Boss’s life. He also believed that his Boss  wouldn’t blame them when he learned about it later.</p><p>Zhang Xinyue, who was next to Xue Sha, was shivering inside. Judging  from Mo Awu and Xue Sha’s conversation, she could tell that Tang Xiu was  in crisis and danger at this moment. What moved and touched her was  that they didn’t even plan to make her help Tang Xiu even if she was  next to them.</p><p>‘What should I do?’</p><p>‘Should I just do nothing and watch Tang Xiu being harmed by the  poison to his death? Or should I sacrifice myself to… save him?’</p><p>‘But if I were to really save him, then more than 20 years of my chastity would be… but still…’</p><p>Zhang Xinyue’s expression kept changing. Although the strong winds  made her somewhat unable to open her eyes, she could clearly see Tang  Xiu’s flushed face while those hands of his indiscriminately groped Mo  Awu’s body.</p><p>‘I’ll save him! Besides, he has saved my life, after all.’</p><p>Zhang Xinyue steeled her resolve and interjected aloud, “Let’s find a place. I’ll save him.”</p><p>“You?”</p><p>Both Xue Sha and Mo Awu blanked out after hearing her words as a look  of incredulity covered their faces instantly. Then, the latter forced a  smile and said, “Miss Zhang, you’re Zhang Xinya’s younger sister, while  our Boss wishes that he could forever hide from her at present. If you  were to save him, then this relationship…”</p><p>“It’s not like because I have feelings for him, I will save him,  alright?” said Zhang Xinyue. “I just don’t want to watch him die like  that without doing nothing. Besides, each step forward in the future can  still be carefully considered later! But if you don’t want me to save  him, then forget what I said.”</p><p>Mo Awu and Xue Sha exchanged glances before the former immediately  shouted in a deep voice, “Do you remember the cave we found near  mountain brooks back then? Let’s go there immediately.”</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>Silhouettes moved lightning fast and then appeared in the mountain  brooks. As those silhouettes reached the entrance of a dark cave, a wild  boar resting there was alarmed. At the moment it roared, a longsword  came flashing to strike its neck and directly killed it.</p><p>The cave was a dozen-square-meter long and over two meters in height  which was enough to accommodate 20 plus people inside. After everyone  sprinted to the inside, Mo Awu pulled away Tang Xiu’s hands and gave  them to Zhang Xinyue and said, “Miss Zhang, I won’t speak any words of  thanks regarding this huge favour, but you will forever be our  benefactor from now on as long as you can save our Boss.”</p><p>Zhang Xinyue’s face was slightly blushing as she grabbed and hugged  Tang Xiu. She shook her head without a word before she spoke with  difficulty, “You all… get out.”</p><p>“We’ll be waiting outside.” Mo Awu nodded and said, “We don’t know if  that powerful enemy can find this place, but we guarantee that we can  stop him even if he finds us.”</p><p>With that said, the rest headed outside the cave in a rush and  quickly dispersed behind the rocks dozens of meters away to keep an eye  on the surroundings. While being vigilant, however, there was also a  vague feeling of helplessness as for how to explain what happened to  their Boss once he woke up.</p><p>Inside the cave.</p><p>Two flashlights with their switches on were placed in the concave of  the half-meter-high mountain wall to illuminate the cave. While hugging  Tang Xiu, Zhang Xinyue could feel his hot hands caressing her body  indiscriminately, causing the redness on her beautiful face to become  stronger like the glowing sunset.</p><p>She really didn’t fall in love with this man. She did have had an  ambiguous relationship with two young men, but it was only during her  student’s days. Later on, due to her meeting many broken-hearted women  due to their relationships, as well as the famed status of her older  sister as a celebrity, she never had any serious boyfriend once. She had  never even kissed a man until now.</p><p>‘Exactly how and what should I do?’</p><p>She was shivering inside due to embarrassment and was feeling shy,  causing her to hesitate and struggle. Just as she was wavering and felt  uncertain, a tearing force tore the clothes on her chest, revealing her  white skin and flesh…</p><p>‘Just go ahead regardless…’</p><p>Zhang Xinyue steeled her resolve and coordinated with Tang Xiu’s unconscious movements as he undressed her.</p><p>Outside the cave.</p><p>Mo Awu was standing together with Xue Sha a few tens of meters away  from the cave entrance. Their eagle-like sharp eyes glanced around so  that even the slightest disturbance could be sensed by them.</p><p>“Aargh…”</p><p>A painful scream was heard from the cave.</p><p>Mo Awu and Xue Sha exchanged glances with a forced, bitter smile. It  was a painful scream from Zhang Xinyue; and they were perfectly aware of  what the scream represented. Perhaps from this moment on, Zhang  Xinyue’s chastity had been given to their Boss. As for this debt of  sentiment that would plague their Boss in the future, they could only  hope that he wouldn’t give them a lesson due to this reason.</p><p>“You know, I’m kinda a bit sympathizing with Boss,” whispered Mo Awu with a sigh.</p><p>“Who can’t vouch for that, really?!” Xue Sha rubbed his temple and  replied helplessly, “Although Zhang Xinyue is also a stunning beauty  among a million women, the one who loves Boss is her older sister. He  doesn’t want to receive her, yet he now has a relationship with her  younger sister, so after this… incident… how would he face Zhang Xinya…”</p><p>“Let’s not involve ourselves in the messed up feelings between men  and women, shall we?” Mo Awu shook his head and bitterly smiled, “If  Boss were to punish us because of this incident, we can only correct our  attitude and bite all the decisions we make to save his life,  regardless.”</p><p>“No worries! We’re not fools either, mate.”</p><p>Xue Sha took out a cigarette subconsciously, but suddenly felt that  the environment and the potential crisis situation were unsuited to  smoking at the moment. He immediately pinched the cigarette and  discarded it at his feet.</p><p>Inside the cave.</p><p>At the beginnings, Zhang Xinyue only felt suffering from pain,  followed by some joy in the middle, and lastly a mix between pain and  joy. Yet, she was very scared since Tang Xiu had really fallen into a  frenzy. She had been holding on while riding the waves for nearly two  hours, but she couldn’t see whether Tang Xiu would stop sailing.</p><p>She wanted to push him, but she failed because she had no strength.  She even shouted with a suppressed voice in Tang Xiu’s ears dozens of  times already, yet it still didn’t work.</p><p>Regardless, the taste of ecstasy with that overwhelming emotion to  the peak faintly made her addicted to it. She even wished it would last  forever if it wasn’t the fact that she was a beginner in such skinship.</p><p>Roar…</p><p>A deep roar came out of Tang Xiu’s throat as his body finally stopped moving in a tremble.</p><p>Immediately after, the cave fell into stillness and tranquility for a long time.</p><p>The day fast-forwarded into the afternoon.</p><p>Tang Xiu finally woke up from his lethargic sleepiness. The instant  he opened his eyes, he immediately unleashed his perception toward the  outside. But the moment after he sobered up, the expression on his  handsome face froze as his eyes he saw the smooth and white woman’s  shoulders beside him and he even took back his spiritual sense.</p><p>‘Heavens! What have I done?’</p><p>Tang Xiu’s breathing turned sharp faster because Zhang Xinyue slept  next to him with a face that looked like she was in a bit of pain.  Although she was still wearing clothes, many parts of it had been  obviously ripped apart.</p><p>What followed was a deathly stillness. After the long silence, Tang  Xiu carefully took out a thin quilt from his interspatial ring and  gently covered Zhang Xinyue’s body with it. He also removed her exposed  long legs that winded on his waist and took out a few more thin quilts  and two sets of clothes, one of which he put next to Zhang Xinyue while  he put on the other one. Afterward, he flashed and appeared outside.</p><p>Though he couldn’t see that the moment when he left the cave, two lines of glittering tears flowed out of Zhang Xinyue’s eyes.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>Mo Awu, Jin Shi, Xue Sha, and Hei Xiong flashed from dozens of meters  away in the distance and quickly stood in front of Tang Xiu, as Mo Awu  then excitedly asked, “Are you all right, Boss?”</p><p>Tang Xiu’s expression, however, was looking somewhat gloomy. He  watched the surroundings and then asked in a heavy voice, “Who among you  asked Zhang Xinyue to save me?”</p><p>The four men exchanged glances as Mo Awu dryly smiled and answered,  “The poison had invaded your body too deep last night, Boss. I was  afraid that you’d be in danger, especially if the aphrodisiac was not  solved in time.”</p><p>“Bastard!” Tang Xiu cursed furiously and yelled, “Don’t you also know  the situation between me and Zhang Xinya? Don’t tell me you don’t know  Zhang Xinyue is her younger sister either? You decided to let this  happen, but how can I solve this problem in the future?!”</p><p>Mo Awu forced a bitter smile and said, “We were originally planning  to take you to Qinglin County and then find some brothels… but… it was  Miss Zhang herself, who decided that… she must save you, so we were…”</p><p>The revelation sent a headache to Tang Xiu, making him rub his temple  and glare angrily at the four men. Then he coldly snorted and said,  “Hmph, just wait and see how I will punish you later!”</p><p>With that said, he turned around and returned to the cave and found  that Zhang Xinyue was still sleeping soundly with the same posture as  previous. He stood in silence for a few minutes and then headed to the  entrance of the cave to sit cross-legged there.</p><p>The aphrodisiac in his system had disappeared at this moment, but  other types of poison still were present inside. Although these poisons  only had a slight effect on him, he still had to remove these poisons  out of his system as soon as possible. Moreover, his internal injuries  might have been a bit better after resting for a while, yet they were  still quite serious regardless.</p><p>After taking the Holy Healing pill, Tang Xiu controlled the Primal  Chaos Force to clean up the poisons inside his system quickly, and then  slowly mended his displaced organs to their previous positions.</p><p>The nourishing process and rejuvenation followed.</p><p>As he had been fully immersed in recuperation and detoxification  treatment, he was unaware that Zhang Xinyue, who was inside the cave,  had slowly sat up and was gently putting on Tang Xiu’s underwear and  jacket beside her.</p><p>She didn’t stand up as she felt her genitalia burning with pain,  causing her not to dare to move carelessly. Staying still in that  posture, she watched Tang Xiu’s back through the aid of the light coming  in from the outside of the cave and fell into her own train of thought  in silence.</p><p>In spite of the fact that she did go ahead with her decision, she was utterly confused at this moment.</p><p>Outside the cave.</p><p>Mo Awu’s group of four came together, while Xue Sha whispered and  stressed his thoughts over and over again, “Remember, guys. We bit the  bullet, yet the purpose was to save our Boss, so we finally accepted  Miss Zhang’s suggestion, got it?! Besides, I’m sure even if Boss  punishes us, it won’t be too serious given what we know from his  character and temper.”</p><p>Mo Awu stroked his chin and whispered back, “Be ready to use the  money we’ve previously extorted at labor camp 1319! If my guess is  correct, the punishment from Boss should be months without our  cultivation resource quota.”</p><p>“I’m also gonna find the time to meet Chen Zhizhong once we get  back,” interjected Jin Shi all of a sudden. “He’s Boss’s disciple, so it  will be very easy for us to buy some precious herbs from him.”</p><p>“Yeah!” The other three nodded.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
