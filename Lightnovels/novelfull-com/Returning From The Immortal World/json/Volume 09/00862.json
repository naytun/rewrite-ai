The extremely cold energy  in his body had turned into an extremely hot one, causing unimaginable  discomfort even though he had tempered his internal organs numerous  times.</p><p>“I got poisoned.”</p><p>Tang Xiu’s hands quickly sealed the arteries into his heart. Little  did he expect that the enemy possessed cultivation at the Golden Core  stage. Even he was nearly unable to believe that he had made a  ridiculous mistake such as putting his guard down and not guarding  against the possibility of the enemy to use poison. He was now sure  about the identity of this enemy. The old man should be the person  mentioned by Bai Zhen and Bai Biao as their Master… Dao Master Poison.</p><p>“This poison won’t kill me, but…”</p><p>Tang Xiu clenched his fist and looked up to the sky at Dao Master  Poison, who rushed down toward him. His figure instantly blinked toward  the open window in front and he came outside nearly in a flash. As the  attic behind him shattered and crashed into the ground, Tang Xiu’s  shadow instantly disappeared into the distant woods.</p><p>A vexed look flashed in Dao Master Poison’s eyes. If this guy were to  fly into the sky, he believed that Tang Xiu could never escape from his  palm given that he had been poisoned and heavily injured by him. But if  this guy were able to get away deep into the forest, it would be hard  to find him, even if his cultivation was at the mid-stage of Golden  Core.</p><p>“I must capture him. The secret arts this little beast just used to  control lightning and electricity is much more powerful than the arts  I’ve mastered. If I can squeeze it out of his mouth, the power I can  unleash in the future will be greatly improved. Absolutely.”</p><p>Dao Master Poison gritted his teeth and quickly chased toward the direction where Tang Xiu just disappeared.</p><p>Outside the courtyard.</p><p>After Mo Awu trio killed Bai Zhen and Bai Biao, they immediately  hurled into the courtyard. But their complexion greatly changed since  the entire pavilion had turned into ruin and their Boss’s figure had  vanished.</p><p>“A powerful enemy must have appeared a while ago. From the two  outbreaks of power we felt just now, one was unleashed by Boss, and the  other one must be from that powerful enemy who appeared all of a  sudden,” murmured Mo Awu in a heavy voice.</p><p>“Then what should we do now?” asked Jin Shi hurriedly. “Is Boss being  chased and running away, or did he leave to pursue the strong enemy?”</p><p>Mo Awu fell into thought for a moment and said, “We’ll leave and  immediately meet up with Xue Sha’s group and head northward. The enemy  is quite powerful, so we must gather together to become stronger.”</p><p>“Roger that!”</p><p>At the mountain peak in the distance.</p><p>Zhang Xinyue looked worried and restless as she watched the soaring  flame in the sky to the north, while Xue Sha and Hei Xiong looked grim  and vigilant as they kept an eye on the situation in the surroundings.</p><p>“Who is it?” suddenly, Xue Sha shouted loudly and instantly unleashed his flying sword.</p><p>Mo Awu’s figure then appeared in front of him and said in a heavy voice, “It’s us. Huh? Where’s Wang Tao?”</p><p>Xue Sha paced forward and said in a deep voice, “There were some  people from Qingcheng Monastery who escaped from the north. Wang Tao  knew two people among them, so he followed those two.”</p><p>“It’s fine that he left,” said Mo Awu indifferently. “But then, we  must head to the north at once to find the whereabouts of our Boss…”</p><p>The worry on Zhang Xinyue’s face turned more visible after hearing Mo  Awu’s words and she interjected, “Why don’t you go then? I’ll be just a  burden if I go with you.”</p><p>“No! You’re going with us since we can’t leave you in this dangerous  place.” Mo Awu shook his head and said, “Let’s go! I’ll hurry along the  road.”</p><p>The northward area of Qingcheng Monastery.</p><p>Tang Xiu dashed lightning fast through the forested mountains, but  his eyes and face gradually turned redder and his veins began to  protrude with a green color and visibly throbbed on his forehead the  longer he ran. He had been suppressing the poison that invaded his body,  but to his frustration, the 10,000 Dragons Poison from Dao Master  Poison contained a very potent aphrodisiac hormone. He could suppress  the poison, but there was no way to force that powerful aphrodisiac  hormone out of his system whatsoever.</p><p>Serpents did have an excessive urge for sex in nature.</p><p>He wouldn’t have any fear if it were only the aphrodisiac hormone  extracted from the serpent’s body, but refining and extracting out the  aphrodisiac from the aquatic dragon’s system with his current  cultivation level was outright madness. Yet, the most infuriating thing  was that he was being chased by Dao Master Poison at the moment.</p><p>He had been confident that he could kill Dao Master Poison before he  got poisoned and badly hit by the ambush. Now, not only had he been  poisoned, but his internal organs had also been displaced, causing very  serious internal injuries that led to the situation where he had no  other means than to escape.</p><p>Given his situation at the present, clashing with Dao Master Poison  head-on only gave him a minuscule chance of winning. Even if he did come  out as the winner, it was very likely that he would have to pay a very  heavy price.</p><p>‘I’ll remember this debt and feud!’</p><p>Tang Xiu gritted his teeth and his speed rapidly accelerated again.  Yet, the more his speed accelerated, the faster the aphrodisiac poison  in his system erupted. When he had run for over 100 km away from  Qingcheng Monastery, Tang Xiu suddenly changed his fleeing direction.</p><p>He could hardly manage to keep sober and soon realized that escaping  from Qingcheng Mountain in this state was not a good option. The  aftermath, in case he did something irrational outside, would be  unimaginable and it would be too late to regret later. Hence, he decided  to take a long detour and circle back to Qingcheng Monastery.</p><p>‘This is bad.’</p><p>While Tang Xiu endured the aphrodisiac poison and was barely able to  maintain his soberness, an overwhelming aura suddenly rushed toward his  location.</p><p>“Gotta pull me up!”</p><p>Tang Xiu flashed forward into the bushes and completely restrained  his aura while his hand quickly activated the Invisibility charm.</p><p>“Bastard punk. I’ll torture and squeeze those two arts out of your  damned mouth when this old man catches you…” Dao Master Poison drivelled  and cursed as he traversed the forested mountain at the speed of  lightning. The distance between him and Tang Xiu was less than 100  meters away previously, yet he couldn’t him at such a close distance and  he quickly passed through to continue chasing northward.</p><p>Half a minute later, Tang Xiu put away the Invisibility charm and  silently jumped out of the bushes and fled to the southern part of  Qingcheng Monastery. If he hadn’t felt the aura of Dao Master Poison  behind him previously, he wouldn’t have been fleeing northward all the  time. He knew that Mo Awu’s group was in Qingcheng Monastery, while  Zhang Xinyue and Xue Sha were in the southern side of the monastery.</p><p>He had been worrying that Dao Master Poison would kill them if that  old man couldn’t catch up to him. But it seemed that he didn’t need to  worry anymore. He only needed to join them and escape to Qinglin County  as quickly as possible. As long as they arrived there, Mo Awu and the  rest would be able to take him away to flee to another place without him  needing to order it.</p><p>‘Pity that I have no Telesthesia Crystal, else it would’ve been  easier to find Mo Awu and the rest with it by sensing their presence and  location.’</p><p>Tang Xiu lamented with some regrets and picked up his speed again faster.</p><p>“Huh?”</p><p>Just as Tang Xiu was nearly at his limit and lost his sense of  reason, he suddenly sensed a few familiar auras in front. His spirit  raised up instantly and he flashed toward their direction.</p><p>“Boss?”</p><p>Mo Awu and the rest were overjoyed upon seeing Tang Xiu, but when  they realized Tang Xiu’s flushed complexion as well as the blood on his  lips and clothes, their jubilant expressions were frozen instantly.</p><p>“Take me and run away from here. The farther the better.”</p><p>Tang Xiu already had blurred vision. He rushed to issue an order  after seeing the worried faces of Mo Awu’s group before he fainted in  the next moment.</p><p>“Awu, what happened to Boss?!” Jin Shi flashed to Tang Xiu’s side and asked with deep worry on his face.</p><p>Mo Awu checked Tang Xi’s pulse and said in a heavy voice, “Boss has  been seriously injured internally. We must find the safest place to hide  as fast as possible and then find a way to heal him. We’ll fly  southward, but do it stealthily to not get spotted. And Xue Sha, you’ll  bring Zhang Xinyue!”</p><p>“Roger that!”</p><p>The rest replied and controlled their flying swords to fly southward.</p><p>Zhang Xinyue, whose hand was grabbed by Xue Sha, only felt dizzy and  heard the strong wind whistling in her ears in the next moment, while  the blowing wind made her somewhat unable to open her eyes. A half  minute later, she was barely able to open them, and once she did she was  frightened and shuddered upon seeing what laid in front of her line of  sight.</p><p>‘Heavens! I’m now… flying?’</p><p>‘No, no, no! Xue Sha takes me up to fly.’</p><p>She was an atheist, one who had never believed in the existence of  any demons or ghosts, much less celestial immortals in this world. But  at this moment, she pinched her own waist and finally realized that she  was not dreaming—she was being towed, so flying was real.</p><p>‘He… and these people… who exactly are they? How can they…’</p><p>10 minutes later, Mo Awu and the rest had flown over the ruins of  Qingcheng Monastery and flew over the sea of fire. Mo Awu suddenly felt  that his waist was being groped and looked down, only to find himself at  a loss whether he had to laugh or cry because it was Tang Xiu’s hands  that were groping and stroking the contour of his body.</p><p>“Something is wrong!”</p><p>Yet, his expression suddenly changed. Before, he just felt that his  Boss’s body was very hot, though he couldn’t find any abnormalities  other than that. But now, he was keenly aware that there was an  abnormality with his Boss’s condition given that he had lost conscious  but seemed to have been dominated by something subconsciously. It was as  if his body was under the urge to vent up something.</p><p>Xue Sha, who brought Zhang Xinyue flying, was very close to Mo Awu  and immediately asked aloud after hearing Mo Awu’s exclamation, “What’s  wrong?”</p><p>“If my guess is correct, Boss has been poisoned and it should be an aphrodisiac,” answered Mo Awu quickly.</p><p>“What?!”</p><p>Xue Sha’s expression drastically changed. He knew that his Boss had a  very high level of cultivation and average aphrodisiac poison would  have no effect on him. But if it was a very potent one, it would  definitely threaten his life if the poison was not removed in time.</p><p>Zhang Xinyue similarly heard Mo Awu’s answer at this moment and  looked flustered and horrified. She knew how strong an aphrodisiac was  because she had seen one of her female colleagues who had been drugged  with it. She saw her finally do shameful and disgusting acts  involuntarily and then end up in agony.</p><p>Xue Sha frowned and said aloud, “Are you not mistaken; Boss really has been poisoned by an aphrodisiac, Awu?”</p><p>“It can’t be wrong,” said Mo Awu firmly. “His body is very hot while  he is subconsciously touching and groping my body. We gotta hurry to  find a solution.”</p><p>“Let’s speed up and try to get to Qinglin County earlier,” said Xue  Sha hurriedly. “We gotta find a place with women and solve the problem  with Boss’s body as quickly as possible…”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
