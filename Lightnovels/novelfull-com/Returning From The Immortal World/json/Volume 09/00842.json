However, his pupils abruptly contracted when a chilling aura came to his neck, causing all the fine hairs all over his body to stand on end.</p><p>‘What’s going on?’</p><p>He had imagined that one day, a butcher knife would be placed on his nape upon waking up, but he never thought it would occur in his own lounge in this prison. He could feel at ease here with the defense system of the prison and the loyal ability users under his command around.</p><p>Augustino’s eyes shifted as they caught the faint light coming in through the window. He could see the bodies on the floor—the bodies of his loyal men.</p><p>Spectre patted Augustino on the cheek and grinned, “Hello, Sir Warden. Well, I’m done staying in prison, you know, so I thought it’s easiest to have you send me off even though I have many ways to escape. How about you get dressed and take us out if you don’t wanna die?”</p><p>A frosty chill filled Augustino’s heart. He felt like falling into an icy hole after having a clear look at Spectre’s face. Of the entire labor camp 1319, the one that could scare him the most, if anyone, was this very devil, ‘Spectre’. Exactly, he was more of a devil than the very Devil himself.</p><p>“You want me to send you off, Spectre, but you don’t need to go so far as to kill my men, no?”</p><p>Although he was aware of the crisis at this time, Augustino still wanted to figure out Spectre’s true purpose. If he sent Spectre outside safely, he feared that he would still be brutally murdered in the end. Spectre was a bold, audacious character to the extreme and there was nothing he dared not to do.</p><p>“You know that I don’t like troubles, and your men will bring me trouble,” sneered Spectre. “On top of that, I still have two comrades. It’s easy for me to go out but not for them, so I can only ask for your help.”</p><p>Agustino turned ghastly pale as fear completely overwhelmed his whole being. Outsiders only saw him as a greedy man who saw money as his life, but he was actually a smart, willy old fox through and through. He could tell that he still had a sliver hope of living if Spectre didn’t explain, but for this devil to explain things, that meant there was only one conclusion—there were deeper secrets hidden behind Spectre’s desire to leave.</p><p>“I just wanna live, Spectre.”</p><p>Jin Shi strode to the front of Augustino. His hand was like an iron claw that grabbed the latter’s neck as he grimly spoke, “Then cooperate and obey us if you wanna live. You know what? Killing you or not is rather insignificant for us either. way But if you can give us some benefits, or transfer some money to buy your life, of course, you’re more likely to stay alive.”</p><p>“Alright, alright. I’ll give it to you,” replied Augustino without thinking.</p><p>Spectre slightly creased his brows. His impression toward Jin Shi and Xue Sha instantly turned worse. Little did he think that Tang Xiu’s men would be this greedy.</p><p>Jin Shi himself was unaware of what Spectre had in mind. He put the dagger on Augustino’s waist and coldly said, “Keep in mind, though. The more money, the more likely you can keep your life.”</p><p>Spectre interjected without being salty nor light, “Jin Shi, he sees money as his life. It’s best not to waste time if you don’t want any mishaps to happen. Besides, you can get money through many means if you want it, right?”</p><p>“You’re not short on money, I suppose?” commented Jin Shi with a grin.</p><p>“I’m not indeed,” said Spectre.</p><p>“Well, rich guy, I’ll share the money from this fella with Xue Sha. We both are so dirt poor that we’re like beggars, you know,’ continued Jin Shi, still grinning.</p><p>Spectre no longer wanted to pay attention to Jin Shi. He could see that Jin Shi and Xue Sha were bent on extorting some fortunes from Augustino as his figure flickered and disappeared from the room.</p><p>Ten minutes later, Augustino had transferred 100 million dollars to Jin Shi’s Swiss bank account. Then Jin Shi and Xue Sha took him as a hostage as they came downstairs, making him call a prison guard to drive a car. The four people then quickly left the prison inside a bulletproof car.</p><p>At a road about two kilometers away from the labor camp 1319, Tang Xiu was sitting quietly in the car while watching the car that was heading out of the prison. Then he said, “You can go! Whether you’ll be successful will depend on your own ability.”</p><p>After saying that, he directly got off and watched the car leave to the distance. Then Tang Xiu fumbled out his mobile and dialed a cell number, “Awu, take the car over here!”</p><p>“Roger. Two minutes.” Mo Awu’s voice came out of the phone.</p><p>Two minutes later, four passenger cars being escorted by two black SUVs quickly headed toward Tang Xiu. As the cars stopped, Mo Awu came down first and respectfully asked, “When can those people come out, Boss?”</p><p>Tang Xiu narrowed his eyes and said, “Within half an hour at the most. More than that means that a mishap has occurred. By the way, is the ship ready to leave?”</p><p>“It should be moored and waiting for us at the port of Portorua.” Mo Awu nodded and said, “It’s a passenger ship that we rent and the departure time is four hours later. The ship originally had a lot of passengers, but it will only provide service to us after we bought it.”</p><p>Tang Xiu nodded with satisfaction and said, “You’ll take care of the route to return. Also, I don’t want to meet any troubles on the way back.”</p><p>“Rest assured, Boss,” said Mo Awu confidently. “All the formalities for the passenger ship have been taken care of. The Boss behind it is a very capable man, so nothing will go wrong. But I’m afraid that we’ll have to think of some other means to move once the liner leaves this country, though.”</p><p>“Use the GPS to find a deserted island in the sea nearby,” said Tang Xiu. “I must train these convicts before taking them to Clam Island.”</p><p>“Roger that.”</p><p>After the conversation, he walked straight to the bulletproof car parked a dozen meters away. As he opened the door, Tang Xiu looked at Augustino and lightly said, “Do as planned and make no mistake.”</p><p>At the moment, the despair on Augustino’s face was even more evident. He could tell that the events that were unfolding were larger than just Spectre escaping from prison. This was especially true after he saw the four buses that were parked tens of meters away. Some huge plot was definitely in motion here.</p><p>“Please spare my life. I’ve given you my money.”</p><p>Tang Xiu stared blankly and creased his brows as he looked at Jin Shi.</p><p>“Well, we’ve been dirt poor recently, Boss,” said Jin Shi with a grin. “We kinda extorted this guy for 100 million dollars, but I’ll send the money to you when we get back.”</p><p>Tang Xiu couldn’t help but burst into laughter and said, “To make this guy who sees money as his life give so much? You really have some tricks up your sleeves, eh? Never mind the money, though. You can share it with the rest!”</p><p>Jin Shi’s grin turned wider and he threw out some flattery, “You’re really great, Boss!”</p><p>“Spare the bootlicking, will you?” scoffed Tang Xiu with a smile as he turned around to leave.</p><p>Augustino realized that Tang Xiu was the most powerful character among these people and he quickly called out, “Please let me go, I beg you. I can give you more money if you think it’s not enough.”</p><p>Tang Xiu’s pace came to a halt. He turned around and smilingly said, “What do you think is more important, money or people?”</p><p>“People.” Although Augustino didn’t know what Tang Xiu was referring to, he answered without hesitation.</p><p>“You said people are more important, so use your life to exchange for 200 strong convicts in your prison. It’s very cost-effective, I think,” said Tang Xiu with a smile. “You see, money is just something that one can’t earn without struggling. But losing talented people is a big loss. Don’t you think so, Augustino?”</p><p>“…YOU… you want to break into prison?” exclaimed Augustino loudly.</p><p>“You know, jailbreaking is kinda bothersome and a waste of energy for us.” Tang Xiu shook his head and said, “Your second-in-command in the prison sold me 200 inmates and received 400 million dollars from me. I think it’s quite a reasonable deal! But for you, you can only become a scapegoat.”</p><p>Immediately after, Tang Xiu motioned for Jin Shi as the latter taped Augustino’s mouth, ignoring the struggles of the guy as he begged and pleaded.</p><p>****</p><p>Inside the prison.</p><p>More than ten prison guards kept opening the cell doors one after another as the prisoners inside came out. Though they didn’t speak, the excited expression on their faces betrayed what they felt inside. They just followed the prison guards and walked down the corridor that headed outside. Soon, 199 prisoners had left their cells and walked quickly to the outside under the curious eyes of many prison guards.</p><p>“Hey, Steve, what the hell is going on here?” asked a police officer in the prison. He had just come out of a female prisoner’s room and had yet to fix his belt properly. He was looking at the prison guards who had just come out with a large number of inmates.</p><p>The prison guard’s expression slightly changed, but he quickly composed himself and formally replied, “The Warden personally issued an order to take them outside to do something, and the warden himself is waiting outside now.”</p><p>That police officer frowned and said with a puzzled expression, “But these convicts are major criminals. Significant problems are bound to occur if you guys send them out. Alright, I’ll send two squads to help you escort them.”</p><p>“Puff…”</p><p>A stocky bearded Caucasian, Whisker, pulled a steel nail from his waist and tore the police officer’s throat, then covered his mouth and pierced his heart with that steel nail. Afterward, he kicked open the door of the cell where that policeman came out from and directly dropped him in while covering his throat.</p><p>“Tsk, tsk. This shit just fucked a female prisoner? Did I just bump into some fucking pervert? Man, she’s seriously injured too!” Whisker looked at the curled-up female prisoner in the corner and uncannily smiled.</p><p>The female prisoner was of Asian descent with a petite body and she looked pretty. Her face suddenly changed when she saw the tragic condition of the policeman who just raped her. She didn’t even pick up her clothes to cover the sensitive parts of her body as she straightly jumped off the bed to the corner, picked up a chair, and smashed it on the dying policeman’s head.</p><p>In just a few seconds, the policeman’s head had been smashed.</p><p>Instead of rushing to leave with the other prisoners, Whisker leaned on the door with folded arms and said with an uncanny smile, “Really. No prisoner detained here is a pushover. Even a young hot chick like you is spicy and ruthless. You’re not bad, lass. Do you wanna leave this shitty hellhole with us?”</p><p>The female prisoner looked up. She didn’t even wipe her face that was covered with blood and brain fluid and straightly asked, “Leaving this place, as in… escaping?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
