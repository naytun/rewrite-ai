He had sharp eyes and insight and had followed his Master when he was young, where he saw the scenes of powerful cultivators who controlled and manipulated swords to fly.</p><p>Unfortunately, his sect didn’t have the heritage to refine the flying sword, let alone the arts to control it. He felt vexed due to the numerous times that he, as a cultivator, found himself not having a magical weapon such as a flying sword.</p><p>“There’s no use in having such a sharp mouth, brat!”</p><p>Dao Master Poison reluctantly took his eyes off the flying sword and slightly flicked his finger.</p><p>Light, who had been vigilantly observing Dao Master Poison, was keenly aware of this finger flick. He immediately flashed back to the middle between Electrolady and Aquababe. His flying swords hovered and danced in a circle mid-air, while both of his hands grabbed the two women’s shoulders as he instantly flashed to step on his flying sword and flew northward towards Qingcheng Mountain.</p><p>“You want to run?”</p><p>Dao Master Poison never expected that Light was so alert and powerful that he was even able to find out that he had secretly released a poisonous mist. His figure instantly turned into shadow as he pursued, only to find with amazement that this guy turned out to be able to control his flying sword to fly very fast. Even though he towed two people with him, his speed was on par with his flying speed limit.</p><p>That was truly a treasure!</p><p>The greed he already had turned more intense and he pumped out his speed to the maximum and burst forward in the blink of an eye to pursue him. In just more than ten breaths, the pursuit had passed through the county town and continued to the top of the mountain at the outermost part of Qingcheng Mountain.</p><p>At the entrance of the Qinglin County Public Security Bureau.</p><p>Tang Xiu suddenly looked up as his sharp eyes suddenly shifted to the northeast sky. He clearly saw several figures moving lightning fast and flying to the north.</p><p>‘It’s Light with Electrolady and Aquababe, while the one who chases them is Dao Master Poison.’</p><p>Tang Xiu clenched his fists and handed over the Invisibility charm to the other three men. Then, he grabbed Wang Rui’s shoulder and instantly soared to fly toward that direction.</p><p>At the mountain peak around Qingcheng Mountain.</p><p>Light’s wholly smiling face drastically changed as he put down Electrolady and Aquababe. It was because Aquababe looked fine, though she didn’t lack her vigilance as she flashed dozens of meters backward with a dagger in her hand. On the other hand, Electrolady spaced out and stood still as she watched Light’s handsome face, seemingly bewitched and intoxicated by him.</p><p>The sight was, nonetheless, quite amusing to Light, so he reached out to pat Electrolady’s pretty face, and he said with a chuckle, “Hey, Beauty. Wake up!”</p><p>“Ah, what?”</p><p>Electrolady seemed to have been dragged from a dream. Conscious of how much of a love-struck fool she just looked like, her stunning face immediately blushed ear to ear as she staggered two steps backwards and bashfully twisted and pinched her clothes.</p><p>Dao Master Poison then landed ten meters away from the trio and took out black gloves from his sleeve pouch and quickly wore them. Light’s speed was too fast, and even though he was confident in his own strength, he still had to be careful at this moment.</p><p>“Hand over your flying sword, Brat! I can spare you your death..”</p><p>“Wow, you’re catching up very fast, old loach!” Light let out a pale smile and said, “Never thought that your cultivation is also at Golden Core stage, more so at mid-stage nonetheless. No wonder you can strike my Grand Master so badly with your poison when he was slightly careless. I gotta admit that I might be unable to beat you in combat alone. But rest your worries, though. It’s not me who must clean you up since Grand Master should be here soon if my guess is correct.”</p><p>His Grand Master?</p><p>Dao Master Poison’s countenance changed and looked surprised as he asked, “Who’s your Grand Master?”</p><p>“Tsk, tsk… you seem to have lived for too long; to think that your intellect has deteriorated this much.” Light shook his head and smilingly said, “You ambushed my Grand Master with your poison. You sneak attacked and even injured him in the Qingcheng Monastery not long ago, am I right?”</p><p>Dao Master Poison’s pupils shrunk and he shouted in a heavy voice, “That youngster? He’s… your Grand Master? Are you kidding me? His strength is just equal to yours at most, how could he possibly be your Grand Master?”</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>A few figures appeared in front of Dao Master Poison in a flash. Tang Xiu put Wang Rui down as his eyes flickered and he coldly said, “Why can’t I be his Grand Master, even if my strength is just equal to his?”</p><p>“It’s really you.” Dao Master Poison was surprised, yet amazed at the same time. “But you have obviously been poisoned; I even struck you hard. How come you’re now…”</p><p>“You wanna know why, as if nothing happened to me, huh?” Tang Xiu grimly sneered and said, “Hehe, if I didn’t have a trivial method to dispel your poison, how could I be worthy to be his Grand Master then? Dao Master Poison, you poisoned me and keep provoking me, and yet you actually dare to stay in Qingcheng Mountain. Do you really think that you’re invincible here?”</p><p>Dao Master Poison was secretly turning vigilant and on guard. He had observed them and discovered that of the three people brought by Tang Xiu, two of them were cultivators, though very weak, whereas the last one seemed to be an average person who has practiced some trivial martial arts.</p><p>However, two of them were strong enemies at Golden Core cultivation stage, regardless. One of whom had powerful magical spells, while the other one had a magical flying sword. If he were to really clash with them head-on, he might not be able to seize the upper hand.</p><p>‘Poison, then…’</p><p>It was his most powerful killing trump card—poison. Facing two powerful enemies, he instantly took out the jade gourd from his waist and unplugged its cap. Two black venomous bees then flew out from the inside. The two bees, however, didn’t directly attack Tang Xiu and the others but sprayed out two clusters of black mist.</p><p>Tang Xiu just glimpsed at it and flicked a Poison Repellent Pill to the front of Light and another one to the cliff tens of meters away before shouting in a deep voice, “Take this pill.”</p><p>Light swallowed the pill without hesitation and respectfully said, “Grand Master, this disciple has arrived here. You might as well give me this ancient poison to resolve? I believe I can kill him here without the need for a burial place in only a few minutes.”</p><p>“Don’t underestimate him and take him lightly,” said Tang Xiu faintly.</p><p>“Understood!”</p><p>Light smiled as a jade flute instantly appeared in his hand and his flying sword hovered around him, while the melodious sound then drifted out from the jade flute.</p><p>A surprised expression flashed in Tang Xiu’s eyes after he heard the sound of the flute playing from Light. There was a happy expression on his handsome face since he didn’t expect that Gu Yan’er would pass the Melody of the Floating Sword to Light. One must know that he was the one who created this Melody of the Floating Sword in the past and taught it to Gu Yan’er when she was a teenager.</p><p>Dao Master Poison retreated sharply and then soared to air and stood there. Disbelief filled his eyes as he shouted harshly, “My bee venom has no effect on you?”</p><p>“I forgot to tell you one thing. You ambushed me with your poison, so I had to waste some time to refine a Poison Repellent Pill.” Tang Xiu sneered at him and continued, “Unless your bees’ venom can kill an expert at the Nascent Soul stage, it won’t have any effect on us whatsoever.”</p><p>Poison Repellent Pill?</p><p>Dao Master Poison’s body trembled and the vigilance on his face grew thicker. He was a poison master; even other cultivators who were at the same cultivation stage of Golden Core were afraid of his poison. Yet, the very thing he worried about the most was encountering a powerful person who had the ability to concoct anti-poison pills.</p><p>‘What should I do?’</p><p>Dao Master Poison began considering whether he should keep fighting or run away.</p><p>Light, however, didn’t give him more time to think. While playing the flute, the flying sword circling around him seemed to be under the control of a General as it suddenly transformed into overlapping layers of sword images. They blotted out the sky and covered the sun as they flashed toward Dao Master Poison. One only needed spiritual sense to execute the secret art to control flying swords at their will, but the Melody of the Floating Sword had a harsher requirement. Along with the wake of the rhythm and tune of the melody, the flying sword seemed to have transformed into a mirage of thousands upon thousands of horses and soldiers in a battle formation as it strangled the enemy in a peculiar position inside the formation.</p><p>‘What is this?’</p><p>Dao Master Poison felt a chill down his spine, and he retreated sharply to the vacant space behind him. From the spectacle of this strike, he didn’t dare to face it head-on, despite having a layer higher of cultivation level than Light’s. However, at this moment, overlapping ripples suddenly appeared in the air tens of meters behind him.</p><p>“Huh?”</p><p>Most of Dao Master Poison’s attention had been focused to the front, making it so he could only notice the air fluctuation from behind at this time, and yet, it made him restless regardless. Being prudent and cautious as he always was, he sharply flashed to the side at the moment he retreated back. But the flying sword flashed in the air and struck his chest. He was barely able to avoid a strike to the heart by a hair’s breadth.</p><p>“Damn.”</p><p>Never once in his wildest dreams did Dao Master Poison expect that there was someone in this world who could hide his body and presence in the air. Just as the suddenly appearing flying sword pierced his body, he saw a shadow suddenly emerge and control the flying sword to swiftly strike him hard.</p><p>“One-eyed Dragon, get out and save me!”</p><p>Dao Master Poison was truly afraid after getting mauled this heavily since the shadow in a black robe not only controlled the flying sword but also had sealed off all his escape routes. Those sword images seemed omnipresent and appeared in front of him in a flash. He clearly realized that he would only meet the God of Death if there was nobody to his rescue!</p><p>“What sinister and evil two younglings!”</p><p>A figure instantly bolted lightning fast from a nearby forested mountain and arrived in an instant. A bronze axe split out and clashed with the flute-controlled flying sword. To Tang Xiu and Light’s surprise, the flying sword was unable to crush the bronze axe; even the overlapping layers of sword images dissipated by the enormous force instead, while the flying sword itself flew back to Light.</p><p>Puff! Puff! Puff! Puff!</p><p>Dark, who was wearing a black robe and controlling her flying sword, left more than ten bloody wounds on Dao Master Poison’s body before she flashed down into the forested mountain below. In just nearly half a second, her figure then disappeared into the dense bushes below.</p><p>Tang Xiu watched the old man who had saved the life of Dao Master Poison. He was a one-eyed blind man with loosely hanging white hair, clad in a grayish-black Chinese tunic suit. His blind eye was covered by an eyepatch made of leather, showing that he was really a one-eyed man.</p><p>“Are you in cahoots with him?”</p><p>One-eyed Dragon let out a hollow laugh and sighed, “The young truly exceed the old, like how the waves behind push those before them, just like in the old saying, really. This old man truly admires you younglings. It’s just, why did you say I’m this Old Poison’s companion? This old man merely follows this Old Poison to collect his debt, but unexpectedly came across this mess.”</p><p>“Old man, I’m really curious what kind of debt Dao Master Poison owes you, to think that he’s worth saving like he’s worthy of your life,” sneered Tang Xiu. “Today’s matter has been set in stone and can only end with death. You are rushing in to meddle so rashly, but there’s no way you are allowed to only pay heed to your own moral betterment while ignoring us.”</p><p>One-eyed Dragon broke into laughter and then said, “Don’t speak so big of a tone, kid. In spite of that this old man is not your match, you can’t stop me if I want to escape. It’s even to the extent that I have always wondered who could stop me in this world, though I’m sure it wouldn’t be more than five people in total.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
