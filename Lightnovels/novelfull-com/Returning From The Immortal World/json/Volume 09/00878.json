He also didn’t bother to care about trivial matters usually. He would never call Miao Wentang just because of the trivial incident at tonight’s charity gala, but it was for Hu Qingsong, his classmate and a good friend who had suffered under Miao Jinlei’s hand that made him unwilling to let this fellow get off scot-free.</p><p>At this time, he already had turned on his mobile phone’s loudspeaker.</p><p>As his call was picked up, Miao Wentang’s voice came out of the phone and Tang Xiu said with a smile, “It’s been a long time, Old Brother Miao. Where are you?”</p><p>“Brother Tang, what a rare occasion of you to call me on your initiative!” Miao Wentang chuckled and replied. “Anyways, I’m currently in Blue City since I’ve got some things to be done here. I should be leaving for Shanghai afterward a couple of days later.”</p><p>“Well, I got something important to tell you, but since you’re coming to Shanghai a few days from now, just forget it! I’ll be waiting for you to come over and tell you directly later,” said Tang Xiu with a smile.</p><p>“Don’t! You said it’s very important, so go ahead, tell me,” replied Miao Wentang in a hurry.</p><p>Tang Xiu intentionally hesitated for a moment as he pretended to sigh and said, “Alright then. I’ll tell you since Brother Miao wants to know it. Anyways, is Miao Jinlei your nephew? I just saw him today.”</p><p>Miao Wentang loudly laughed and said, “What do you think about him, Brother Tang? He’s passable, no?”</p><p>“He’s indeed.” Tang Xiu forced a smile and said, “Definitely a man who will court disaster and cause calamity to befall upon his family. I even experienced it from him today.”</p><p>“That’s my nephew for… No! What did you say? He’ll court disaster for the family? What do you mean by that, Brother Tang?” Miao Wentang’s voice from the mobile suddenly changed tone.</p><p>“Sigh…” Tang Xiu sighed and said, “I truly didn’t want to call you this time, but we have an excellent personal relationship—comrade-in-arms, who have fought shoulder by shoulder with our lives on the line. I even hesitated for a long time before I decided to call you! But alas… I could be suspected of complaining, so to speak, nonetheless!”</p><p>Miao Wentang’s tone turned solemn and he seriously said, “You said we are brothers since we have braved dangers and had our lives on the line together, so do tell what you wanna tell me.”</p><p>Tang Xiu glanced at Mu Wanying next to him and said, “Brother Miao, something happened tonight… I’ll tell the short version of the story. It was just a trivial incident of a bidding session at the charity gala’s auction, but I couldn’t be bothered to lengthen it since I know that he’s your nephew. Besides me, however, he also offended Zhang Yueming, Gu Changmin, and Zhang Qingfeng.”</p><p>“That damned bastard!”</p><p>Miao Wentang was so angry that he nearly fainted and cursed.</p><p>“Don’t get anger flushing to your head first, Brother Miao.” Tang Xiu sighed and continued, “You also know about the Old Blind lady from Miao Region, right?”</p><p>“The Old Blind lady of Heavenly Secrets Lineage?” exclaimed Miao Wentang suddenly, shocked.</p><p>“Yeah, it’s her.” Tang Xiu nodded and said, “I can tell you that I’m very close with her and I’ll be taking care of her as she passes her remaining days in the future. You can say that she’s an elder quite close to me. I also learned some divination arts to calculate fate from her, and even though I have yet to reach great accomplishment, I can still peep into some Heavenly Secrets from the Heavenly Dao and I’ve verified it with the inheritance imparted to me.”</p><p>Miao Wentang knew Tang Xiu’s abilities and he had long guessed that Tang Xiu had a very terrifying heritage. Added with the abilities learned from that mysterious Old Blind, he would be able to surpass the latter, meaning that his cultivation in divination art must have reached a frightening level as well.</p><p>While suppressing the shock he had inwardly, Miao Wentang hurriedly asked, “Please continue, Brother Tang.”</p><p>“I already told you the incidents I encountered today, didn’t I,” sighed Tang Xiu. “Tonight’s charity gala was pretty much bland in and of itself, but your nephew turned it into an excessive show, hence why I used divination art to peer into his fate on impulse. And, the result was… alas!”</p><p>“What’s the result, Brother Tang?” asked Miao Wentang hurriedly, “Please don’t keep me hanging like this. Just tell me—what did you see when you peered into my nephew’s fate?”</p><p>“He is an evil star that is the bane of other’s existence and has a bloody path to walk on,” said Tang Xiu.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>Miao Wentang, who was in Blue City, instantly paled with disbelief. His heart couldn’t bear it and shuddered a few times.</p><p>“He should have a magical tool that can protect him, allowing him to grow up safely up until now, and he will stay safe and sound for the next few years,” said Tang Xiu solemnly. “But when he turns twenty-seven, the accumulated disaster will break out abruptly; when that time comes, huge changes will befall upon your Miao Family. What I saw was bloodshed as the blood of your family flows like a river and their dead bodies lied around everywhere. He’s the only one who survives the ordeal, destined to live alone and to be tormented for the rest of his life as he spends his remaining years in loneliness until death comes to take him away.”</p><p>“How could that happen? How can this be?”</p><p>Instantly, Miao Wentang’s face was as though devoid of blood. He didn’t doubt Tang Xiu who had too many magical and mysterious abilities.</p><p>Yet still, how could that be possible?</p><p>He was a cultivator, while his Miao Family was also the richest and most powerful family in Haiqing Province. They had power, influence, and wealth; how could such a giant suddenly collapse?</p><p>Inside the car.</p><p>Mu Wanying was tongue-tied and dumbfounded as she watched Tang Xiu, and even her eyes contained a particularly strange expression. Never once had she ever thought that she would learn that Tang Xiu would be spitting out such nonsensical things that even made Miao Wentang scared shitless.</p><p>A long time had passed before Miao Wentang asked with a bit of a trembling voice, “Then what should I do, Brother Tang? How can I cast away the disaster that will plague my family?”</p><p>Tang Xiu produced a dry grin and said, “I already must pay some price for revealing what should be classified as Heavenly Secrets. If I were to reveal more, the punishment from Heaven will come swifter and heavier than the previous, so I’m sorry, I can’t help you.”</p><p>Miao Wentang fell into silence for a while and said, “Are you now in Shanghai, Brother Tang? Please wait for me there; let’s just meet there and talk.”</p><p>As the call ended, Tang Xiu put away his mobile and glanced at Mu Wanying who was looking both hesitant and eager to speak. He spoke out, “Do you think I’m evil?”</p><p>“No. Miao Jinlei is too wicked. It is exactly as you said—if he keeps acting like this, he will definitely bring disaster to his family in the future. But I don’t understand why you are so serious about this issue?”</p><p>The smile on Tang Xiu’s face faded away as he turned his head to look at the scenes of the street outside the window. His expression turned a lot colder when he replied, “I wouldn’t have been bothered to stretch this issue if it were just a trivial incident that happened tonight with him. It’s not because I spent twenty million yuan either. The money has been paid off from the exchange with Zhang Qingfeng to introduce you to more businesses, so it was worth it. But Miao Jinlei has literally made my brother suffer for many days, causing him to drown in alcohol just to cast away his depression. It is this account he must pay for.”</p><p>“You did all this just for Hu Qingsong?” asked Mu Waning incredulously.</p><p>“Yeah.” Tang Xiu nodded and said, “If Miao Jinlei attaches importance to people’s feelings, he should be able to treat that girl he snatches in the future well, and I won’t take a hard stance like this. But I’m sure you know about him better than I do. Why would such a young master degenerate like him possibly be able to have special feelings for a girl? Therefore, it is because he can’t do that and has made my brother suffer that I must take severe action.”</p><p>“Truthfully speaking, I might not have taken the initiative to find and bully Miao Jinlei if we didn’t meet him tonight. But now that I met him, it’s like all the old and recent grudges have now combined.”</p><p>Mu Wanying caught everything quickly and a smile appeared on her face. Then she said, “Well, I suddenly realized that being your family member and friend is quite a good thing since we at least need not fear getting bullied.”</p><p>“Let me tell you one thing. Why do I cultivate? It’s because I want to have the absolute power to protect my loved ones,” said Tang Xiu with a pale smile. “There’s only one rule in this world, or rather the world with living beings—that the weak will stand as easy prey to the strong. Only with absolute strength can we live happily ever after.”</p><p>“I believe you can do it,” said Mu Wanying softly.</p><p>Time fleeted by and it now was four in the morning.</p><p>The door of the deluxe private room of the Century Hotel in Shanghai was kicked open and four burly men rushed into the room aggressively. Following behind them was the grim and angry-looking Miao Wentang.</p><p>Inside the bedroom, the naked Miao Jinlei abruptly awakened from his sleep. The girl who was only wearing her underwear screamed in fright as she woke up and saw the big men who rushed inside. She hid under the quilt and shivered.</p><p>“What are you doing?!”</p><p>Miao Jinlei jumped out of the bed in a panic before grabbing his pajamas on the floor and putting them on hurriedly. Just as he was about to tie the pajamas, however, a rough palm slapped his face and directly sent him flying for a few meters before his body heavily fell on the soft carpet.</p><p>“FUCK! It’s you, you wretched bastard! You’re just the dog my uncle has raised, yet you dare hit me?” Miao Jinlei, who was knocked dizzy, didn’t get up but cursed loudly instead.</p><p>Bam…</p><p>This made Miao Wentang angrier, and right at the moment when Miao Jinlei tried to get up, he heavily kicked his nephew’s waist. He didn’t use too much strength to slap him previously, but the kick just now was very heavy and at least broke a few of Miao Jinlei’s ribs.</p><p>“Open your fucking dog’s eyes, shithole! Look who I am!”</p><p>Miao Wentang’s anger seemed not yet vented out, so he straightly grabbed Miao Jinlei’s long hair and picked him up from the floor, slapping his face continuously while angrily chiding him.</p><p>Miao Jinlei’s vision was full of stars after getting beaten and blood filled his mouth. After he was thrown to the floor, he tried to open his eyes to look towards the direction of the familiar voice. His body suddenly shivered as he exclaimed, “Uncle, you… what are you hitting me for? It’s so painful… you’re killing me.”</p><p>Miao Wentang pointed at his nose and shouted, “Hitting you? I wish I could kill you. You truly have done a fucking great job of offending four families in just a day, wretched bastard! Your father will definitely break your legs and sew your dog’s mouth if he knows what you did.”</p><p>‘Offending four families?’ Miao Jinlei was dumbfounded. ‘When and where did I offend four families at once?’</p><p>“Uncle, are you not mistaken? I never did that!”</p><p>“You still dare to talk back?!” Miao Wentang yelled. “So Tang Xiu called me to smear you for no fucking reason?”</p><p>Miao Jinlei instantly understood the cause of the incident. A look of hatred burst in his eyes as he recalled Tang Xiu and Mu Wanying, so he angrily yelled back, “How come you only listen to that damn bastard? Right, I offended that guy surnamed Tang, but that was only at the charity auction. It’s not a big grudge whatsoever! You told me that I’ve offended four families? It’s nothing but a damn lie!”</p><p>Pa!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
