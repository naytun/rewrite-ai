He just saw Ma Xiaorong as a brute as his fist rumbled and punched his face.</p><p>Screaming? No scream was heard because Tang Xiu’s fist would hit Ma Xiaorong’s mouth whenever he was about to scream. Finally, Tang Xiu sent the last blow which broke the guy’s nose and then delivered him another kick under the watch of everyone’s dumbfounded eyes in the surroundings.</p><p>Was this even a savage beating?</p><p>Tang Xiu didn’t even use much of his power, yet his beating made Ma Xiaorong overwhelmed with so much pain that he curled up like a shrimp that was constantly twitching on the floor.</p><p>“STOP!”</p><p>Finally, one of Ma Xiaorong’s bodyguards reacted and angrily howled as he immediately attacked Tang Xiu. It was a pity that Mo Awu’s fist came and sent him flying upside down before he could reach Tang Xiu. Even Mo Awu didn’t stop here, instead, he rushed toward the other bodyguards like a tiger plunging into a flock of sheep. After the raging fists that Mo Awu sent them, all the bodyguards were knocked down and wailed as they were twitching on the floor.</p><p>After the slapping session, Tang Xiu took a relieving sigh of satisfaction and smilingly said, “Now you saw that, didn’t you, Zhenglin? That’s how you must treat this kind of thuggish, idiotic, unbridled, and reckless chaps. Just beat them up ruthlessly. If they don’t give in after you beat them hard once, then do it a second time. If they’re still not giving in the second time, then fuck them up 20 times, or 200 times if needed. You know, going to a gym for exercise is rather expensive nowadays, so having human sandbags sent to your door is definitely much better than going to a gym, no?”</p><p>“…”</p><p>Long Zhenglin’s lips fiercely twitched twice and he looked up towards the sky. He was not an abnormal freak like Tang Xiu for god’s sake. Let alone, he didn’t have combat prowess as Tang Xiu did; even if he did, he still needed to factor in the Ma Family’s power in Tianjing. It was obvious that Ma Xiaorong was not one he could bully that easily either.</p><p>Several minutes later, Tang Xiu and Long Zhengyu swaggered away from the Mingyuan Resort. When Ren Qi, the owner of the resort, came in a hurry to see a bunch of wailing people all over the place and immediately felt like his head was about to explode. He then walked to Ma Xiaorong and gently kicked the guy, asking, “You haven’t died yet, right? Get fucking up if you can stand, will you? Else, I’ll dial 120 and have some ambulances come here.”</p><p>Ma Xiaorong struggled to get up from the floor. He still felt throbbing spasms of pain all over his body, but he still wiped his tears and blood off of his nose as he uttered in unclear words, “You, Ren! This Daddy will go all out and fight you if you dare dial the 120 emergency number. Sonuvabitch, goddammit. Where is that fucking bastard who just hit me heading to now?”</p><p>Ren Qi rolled his eyes and ignored him entirely. He turned around toward the people nearby who tried to find out what had happened. After which, he immediately got struck with a headache again as he looked at Ma Xiaorong and resentfully said, “Hey, surnamed Ma, can’t you just slightly behave like a human? The Third Old of your family was so drunk when he came here the other day which made me furious. He made my place turn upside down, and you actually took your turn… the youngest moth, making a ruckus in my place. Do you really want to force me to hang a sign at the entrance saying ‘No Ma Family members allowed to enter’?”</p><p>“Hey! My third brother is my third brother, Ma Weibo is Ma Weibo,” retorted Ma Xiaorong angrily. “Goddammit, this Daddy got done in today, but this is not finished yet. That bastard Long Zhenglin seems like he’s eaten some tiger’s heart, he even brought his dog to bite me. I’ll definitely crush him to pieces.”</p><p>“I don’t give a fuck whether your name is Ma Weibo, Ma Xiaorong, or Fourth Ma. But I want you to stop looking for them for me. You clearly know what Long Zhenglin’s background is. He’s the second son of the Long Family from Star City and you also know the weight of the Long Family. They are not people you can fight easily. And that one called Tang Xiu… I advise you to stop provoking him. For Long Zhenglin to address him as Big Brother, his background is probably much stronger than his.”</p><p>“You mean… I just got beaten for nothing? Are you out of your mind or am I? Fuck you!” Ma Xiaorong angrily growled. “Hmph… Tang Xiu, eh? I’ll remember him. If he’s still in Tianjing in the next two hours, I’ll make him crawl when he leaves Tianjing.”</p><p>Ren Qi was speechless but immediately shook his head after watching the furious Ma Xiaorong leave, swaggeringly leading his unlucky bodyguards. After mulling it over, he then took out his mobile phone and dialed Long Zhenglin’s number. With his call got picked up, he spoke with a bitter smile, “Tell me something Second Long, even if your brother wanted to play, he didn’t have to make it this big of a deal, no? You don’t know what kind of man Fourth Ma is. Isn’t this equal to creating some hostility with him?”</p><p>“It’s fine,” replied Long Zhenglin perfunctorily.</p><p>“Ah, forget it, I won’t meddle with your business,” sighed Ren Qi helplessly and then said, “But do be careful and take shelter or hide if things go awry, you hear me? That lunatic is definitely going home to find his brother. Also, please advise your brother to leave Tianjing quickly. You know perfectly well how powerful the Ma Family here is.”</p><p>“Relax. I know what to do.”</p><p>Tianjing City, Hongshan District.</p><p>There was an ancestor site of the Ma Family established here which covered a large area. As early as the time of the Anti-Japanese War, the Ma Family was already a famous notable family in Tianjing City and they still were a landlord with considerable power up to now. Most of the elders of Ma Family had, at the very least, went to study overseas. Due to their deep knowledge on ideology and ideas, they were well acquainted with the Communist Party’s successor in the era of the War of Resistance. Therefore, they had a relatively easy time in passing through the time of the War of Resistance smoothly.</p><p>The wealth and connections left by their ancestors, together with their decades of development, made the Ma Family able to agglomerate enormous power. Even the new, start-up major families found it hard to shorten the gap between them and the Ma Family in Tianjing.</p><p>The Ma Family’s manor itself covered an area of 100 acres in which they had developed distinct floors facing the northern side of the foot of the mountain. Hence, the manor was developed northward. The more northward the members lived, the more rights they had and the more they belonged to the core clan.</p><p>Cough, cough…</p><p>In the center of the northernmost end of the Ma Family manor, inside an antique attic, a constant coughing voice was heard. Dozens of core members of the Ma Family were gathering outside the attic, each with a deep worry hung on their faces, while their eyes kept glancing at the closed door from time to time.</p><p>Creak…</p><p>The door was opened from the inside as a white-haired old man in a gray long coat came out with several doctors. Among these doctors was a rather famous cardiologist in Tianjing who had made great achievements in Western medical science. The other two were also known to have high expertise among Chinese medical practitioners.</p><p>At the moment, however, be it the white-haired old man or the other five doctors, they all wore a solemn expression, resulting in a growingly bad premonition inside the hearts of the people who had been waiting outside and saw their solemn expressions,</p><p>“Second Uncle, doctors, how is the situation with my father?” hurriedly asked Ma Jianfeng, the Head of Ma Family.</p><p>“He’s in a very serious condition.” the white-haired old man shook his head and said, “Even if we send him to a big city like Shanghai or Beijing, I’m afraid that no one is able to save him from such a desperate predicament.”</p><p>Ma Jianfeng’s heart trembled and he was about to say something more, but when he saw the expression of these five doctors, he swallowed back his words.</p><p>“I’m sorry. We need to take our leave first.”</p><p>One of the middle-aged men in a white coat sighed and walked outside. The other few didn’t hesitate to follow him and walked away quickly. However, one of them, a middle-aged man in his 40s who wore very ordinary clothes, suddenly stopped after seven steps. He seemed to mull over something as he turned back to the front of Ma Jianfeng and the others, took a deep breath and then said, “Jianfeng, we are old friends, so I offer you my advice. I don’t dare give a 100% guarantee that it’ll be useful to you. But as long as some certain people are willing to help, there’s still a good chance.”</p><p>“Certain people?” asked Ma Jianfeng hurriedly. “And they are…”</p><p>“I’m a Chinese medical practitioner and I know a lot of things in this field,” explained the middle-aged man. “Your father’s condition is very serious and we are at loss of what to do. But there are some people among our circle; specifically speaking, they are those who are hailed as miracle-working, divine doctors. I know three of these people. Apart from Divine Doctor Leng whose traces haven’t been found for more than a decade, the other one is Divine Doctor Gui Jianchou whose whereabouts is uncertain since he drifts from one place to another. But another one is a young divine doctor called Tang Xiu. He has been rising in fame in recent years. If he is willing to help, maybe your father can live for a few more years.”</p><p>“How can I find them?” asked Ma Jianfeng quickly.</p><p>“I’m uncertain of Divine Doctor Gui Jianchou’s whereabouts,” said the middle-aged man. “But I know the young Divine Doctor Tang Xiu. He’s a doctor at the Star City Chinese Medical Hospital, but he rarely works on duty there now. Rumors have it he’s studying at Shanghai University, although I can’t verify it. Your Ma Family has a vast network, you can check it out yourself.”</p><p>“I’ll send people to check it out at once,” said Ma Jianfeng without hesitation. “I’m willing to pay however big the price if it’s for my father.”</p><p>The white-haired old man heavily nodded and stressed, “That’s right. Even if we must spend billions of our Ma Family’s assets, I’ll do it to heal my eldest brother.”</p><p>At this time, an off-road car vroomed to the inside, followed by a braking sound as its door opened. Just as Ma Xiaorong jumped out of the driver seat with a bloody nose and a swollen face, he shouted, “Hey, I heard there are doctors in our house, where are they? Hurry up here and treat me!”</p><p>Tens of the core members of the Ma Family, as well as the middle-aged Chinese medical practitioner who was staying temporarily, were stunned. Ma Xiaorong’s appearance looked very miserable at this moment, given the footprints on his clothes and the injuries on his face.</p><p>Being in an awful mood at this moment, Ma Jianfeng was furious upon seeing his son’s appearance and yelled, “What hell happened to you? And where did you fool around this time?”</p><p>Despite being one who feared nothing, his father was someone Ma Xiaorong was very afraid of. Hearing his scolding made him immediately shrink and turn back to the car.</p><p>“STOP!” yelled Ma Jianfeng.</p><p>With a bit of fear on his face, Ma Xiaorong halted his pace and said with a bit of a fearful look, “D-Dad, I-I’ve b-been injured, so don’t hit me, okay? Take a look at my nose and my mouth. I… that darn Long Zhenglin and his friend Tang Xiu from Star City did this to me. Third Brother, are you here? Why didn’t you pick my call? Let’s go and help me revenge them.”</p><p>Ma Jianfeng’s face turned completely dark, while Ma Weikang, who was in the crowd of the Ma Family, shrunk his neck as he angrily glared at Ma Xiaorong. Even if this bloke wanted to take his revenge, why did he have to speak about it so loudly in front of so many of their family members?</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
