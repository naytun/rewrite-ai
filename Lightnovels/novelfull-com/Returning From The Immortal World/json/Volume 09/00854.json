On account of the fact that he did like Zhang Xinya, it was needless to say that he would never hurt her, but without major affectionate feelings, he could only be half-hearted and perfunctory, which would hurt her the most.</p><p>Long Zhenglin himself knew Tang Xiu for a long time and naturally understood his character. Apart from forcing a smile, he could only turn back to the room and continue to sleep.</p><p>Inside the room of the presidential suite 1206, Zhang Xinya straightly returned to the main bedroom and burst into tears. The wound created by Tang Xiu’s words inside her heart was very deep and the pain she felt was like having her heart sheared by a knife.</p><p>Outside the room, regrets fully covered Zhang Xiaoyu’s pretty face since she was the one who enthusiastically told her about Tang Xiu just to make her happy, but that unscrupulous and unfeeling bastard just made Zhang Xinya suffer.</p><p>‘What should I do?’</p><p>She didn’t want to see Zhang Xinya drown in sadness. She may be her new manager, but she sincerely hoped that Zhang Xinya could work and live in happiness.</p><p>‘The opening sale ceremony of the Golden Goblet Emperor Gauze villa complex the day after tomorrow is very important, so Sis Xinya will definitely attend the event and sing a few songs, but her current mood will definitely affect the day. If she keeps crying, she will lose her voice and have swollen eyes, negatively affecting her.’</p><p>Zhang Xiaoyu was so anxious that she wandered around the room for a long time. Suddenly, she remembered another person and immediately went back to her room, hurriedly grabbed her mobile phone, and dialed a cell number.</p><p>“Hey, how haven’t you rested yet, Xiaoyu? Why are you calling me so late?” Zhang Xinyue’s lazy voice came from the phone.</p><p>“Big Sis Xinyue, I seem to have made a mistake,” said Zhang Xiayu bitterly.</p><p>“What mistake did you make?” Asked Zhang Xinyue, “Did my sister scold and reprimand you?”</p><p>“We’re now in Qinglin County at the foothill of Qingcheng Mountain. We were invited to participate in a business’ publicity event, Sis Xinyue,” said Zhang Xiaoyu hurriedly. “But I didn’t expect to meet that bad guy, Tang Xiu, in the same hotel we’re checking in. Sis Xinya waited for him for a long time, and finally met him, but…”</p><p>After narrating the whole story, Zhang Xiaoyu continued, “Sis Xinya is now crying so badly. She’s truly broken-hearted. Big Sis, what should I do here?”</p><p>There was no reply from Zhang Xinyue from the mobile for a long while. Only after Zhang Xiaoyu loudly asked did Zhang Xinyue speak in a deep voice, “When will the commercial event be held?”</p><p>“The day after tomorrow,” hurriedly answered Zhang Xiaoyu.</p><p>“I’ll rush to get there tonight if it’s the day of after tomorrow so I can catch up tomorrow,” said Zhang Xinyue. “But remember, you must stay with her and wait there before I arrive.”</p><p>“Alright.”</p><p>Early in the morning, when the first ray of sunshine illuminated the bedroom, Tang Xiu had just concluded several hours of cultivation. He then took a shower and dressed up before visiting the hotel’s dining room for breakfast, then quickly left the hotel. He heard from Wang Tao yesterday that Qinglin County also had a medicinal herbs market, so he was preparing to visit the premises.</p><p>The Eastern municipality.</p><p>The Qinglin County’s medicinal herbs market was not large, but the faint scent of medicinal herbs already drifted in the air even when Tang Xiu had yet to enter it. He didn’t want to waste time and strode fast to the entrance of the market and immediately released his spiritual sense to search for previous herbs.</p><p>His spiritual sense quickly observed all the medicinal herbs in the market in just ten minutes. What made him pleasantly surprised was that he found several previous herbs and with sufficient high age at that. After spending some money to buy them, he quickly lost interest in staying here.</p><p>“You’ll need to wait for half an hour if you want to buy more precious herbs, Boss Tang. Today is the weekly opening time of our Qinglin County’s medicinal herbs market, so a batch of medicinal ingredients will be delivered here at 9 o’clock. Of course, you can expect quite a fierce competition. Some people who do herb business in the surrounding major cities will also come here to buy those herbs, too,” Cheng Yan, the owner of the Hall of Myriad Herbs, spoke with a smile. He felt that he had just gained a fortune from the two precious herbs Tang Xiu bought from him. Moreover, nearly half of the medicinal ingredients delivered in the opening week of the market were usually purchased by the apothecary of hi his Hall of Myriad Herbs from various major villages.</p><p>After hearing it, Tang Xiu inquired, “Are there any precious herbs being sent over here?”</p><p>“There should be.” Cheng Yan nodded and said, “There have been precious herbs appearing every week, even though the quantity is very few. You see, we are very close to Qingcheng Mountain and many people here know about medicinal herbs, to begin with. Especially now that there’s the rapid transmission of information, those herbalists know the value of the precious herbs, so we have a lot of people to gather the herbs. There are even some who are brave enough to go to the depths of Qingcheng Mountain to find them.”</p><p>“If so, then I’ll be waiting here,” said Tang Xiu.</p><p>As half an hour passed by, several cars headed into the Qinglin medicinal herb market. Two of them then parked at the entrance of the Hall of Myriad Herbs as it was the largest and oldest apothecary store in the entire market. Additionally, many herbalists also visited this store to sell their goods, even though the store itself had its own apothecaries to collect herbs. Unless the medicinal herbs were unable to enter the eyes of his store, half of the delivered medicinal ingredients were usually taken by the Hall of Myriad Herbs.</p><p>‘River Root Reed?’</p><p>Even when the two cars hadn’t yet unloaded their medicinal herbs cargo, Tang Xiu had already found some precious herbs with his spiritual sense. However, the appearance of such a herb here surprised him somewhat.</p><p>There was a river in the Immortal World known as the Ebbtide Heavenly River. The riverside of the said river had rich Yin energy, making it the endemic place for this River Root Reed. Soon after discovering this, some powerful immortals discovered that the River Root Reed would grow rapidly if they were to feed the river with corpses.</p><p>And thus, the other name of this River Root Reed was Corpse Eater Grass.</p><p>Yet, it had a very special effect. It could make bones qualitatively change, be it the bones of mortals or immortals. Therefore, many immortals preferred to use the River Root Reed as an auxiliary herb to sharpen their body refinement medicine.</p><p>Shortly after the two cars had unloaded all their goods, Tang Xiu picked up several good quality herbs to buy, including that River Root Reed. But its price was very low: only 280 yuan.</p><p>‘With this River Root Reed, once I obtain the Red Silk Flower, the effect of the Blood Seizing Pill I’ll refine will be a lot better. I can definitely break through to the Blood and Qi Circulation stage after taking the Blood Seizing Pill.’</p><p>As noon came, Tang Xiu returned to the 5-star Senbao Hotel. But just as he entered the hotel, he saw Zhang Xiaoyu rushing out from the elevator.</p><p>“Hmph… this bad guy again.”</p><p>Zhang Xiaoyu, who also saw Tang Xiu, halted her pace and angrily glared at Tang Xiu before she ran and bypassed from the side, disappearing at the hotel entrance.</p><p>Tang Xiu couldn’t help but chuckle. He neither felt angry nor resentful toward this woman. He even thought that it was great for Zhang Xinya to have such a new assistant. At least, this assistant was unlike the previous assistant when he first met Zang Xinya. That one forced Zhang Xinya to wander around the airport penniless and made her look for him to borrow some money.</p><p>Outside the hotel.</p><p>Zhang Xiaoyu looked around for a while before a red Mercedes-Benz car stopped in front of her. As its door opened, Zhang Xinyue, with a mask and sunglasses on, gave the car’s keys to Zhang Xiaoyu and asked, “On which floor and what room number does my Sister stay here at?”</p><p>“12th floor, in presidential suite 1206,” answered Zhang Xiaoyu quickly.</p><p>Zhang Xinyue nodded in response and headed toward the hotel entrance.</p><p>Zhang Xiaoyu looked hesitant for a moment before she quickly chased for a few steps and said, “Big Sis Xinyue, that bad guy just returned to the hotel and he stays in the presidential suite 1208. Please scold him for me if you see him.”</p><p>Zhang Xinyue halted her pace and replied after turning around, “Xiaoyu, I know you care so much about my sister, but you shouldn’t meddle in her emotional issues. Besides, I have met Tang Xiu and he’s indeed a very good man. It’s me who doesn’t want my big sis to get entangled in any emotional relationship with him.”</p><p>Zhang Xiaoyu blanked out and she looked a bit nervous and said, “I understand, Big Sis.”</p><p>Then, Zhang Xinyue took the elevator to the 12th floor. She didn’t rush to the presidential suite 1206 but instead headed toward 1208 and rang its doorbell. As the door opened, she took off her sunglasses and mask, and then asked, “Is Tang Xiu inside?”</p><p>Mo Awu, who opened the door, was immediately stunned and hesitated but finally replied, “Yes.”</p><p>Zhang Xinyue came inside and saw Tang Xiu sitting on the sofa, fiddling with his mobile phone. She immediately smiled and greeted, “We meet again, Mr. Tang.”</p><p>Tang Xiu looked up and shook his head and smilingly replied, “To tell you the truth, I’ve seen a lot of twin sisters, but the ones that look identical like you two sisters are really rare. Anyways, did you just rush over to Qinglin County in a hurry? Hahaha… you really care about your big sister.”</p><p>Zhang Xinyue came to the front and took a seat across Tang Xiu, and smilingly said, “She’s my Big Sis, after all, so it’s natural that I must care about her so much. And Mr. Tang, I have to thank you for using your words to stimulate my sister.”</p><p>“There’s no need for such pleasantries, it’s just what I must do,” waved Tang Xiu.</p><p>Zhang Xinyue fell into silence and then suddenly asked, “Mr. Tang, is your relationship with your girlfriend is as good as ever?”</p><p>“Of course. Why the question, though?” said Tang Xiu with a tranquil expression.</p><p>A disappointed look flashed in Zhang Xinyue’s eyes. She then nodded and said, “I see. Then I’ll persuade my older sister to let her feeling go earlier. Also, if it’s not necessary, I’d like to ask you not to meet my sister again in the next few days. We’ll leave Qinglin immediately after she finishes her business event.”</p><p>“I don’t want to meet her again either, but I’m afraid it will be difficult,” Tang Xiu shook his head.</p><p>“Why?” Zhang Xinyue frowned.</p><p>“Your older sister is invited to perform a commercial show here, as far as I know,” said Tang Xiu. “And I must also attend the opening sale ceremony of this Golden Goblet Emperor Gauze villa complex tomorrow. We’ll both come to the same place and time, so I’m afraid that it will be difficult not to meet her, unless…”</p><p>“Unless what?” asked Zhang Xinyue.</p><p>“Unless you replace your old sister and attend the opening sale ceremony for the said villa complex on her behalf,” said Tang Xiu. “However, I think she will perform at the opening ceremony tomorrow, so you must be prepared if you replace her there.”</p><p>Zhang Xinya spent a while in thought before she slowly nodded and said, “I’ll discuss this with my sister. I can take her place at the opening ceremony if she’s willing. But I’m not as good as her when performing the program, though it won’t be that noticeable, so I’m confident that I can do it.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
