Once Awu has bought all the herbs I need, we can leave this place  to get rid of that decrepit Dao Master Poison. For safety’s sake,  however, I already contacted Dark and Light to come here.”</p><p>“Dark and Light are coming here, Boss?” Jin Shi was surprised.</p><p>“Yeah. This is the issue I’m about to tell you.” Tang Xiu nodded and  said, “I asked Awu to contact them. I expect them to arrive in Qinglin  County this evening, so you are to go quietly in the afternoon,  precisely to the hotel suite we checked in last time. You’ll wait for  them there and then bring them over.”</p><p>“Understood.” Jin Shi nodded without a word and then flew away to the distance.</p><p>Not far away from them, after Zhang Xinyue consoled herself, she  quickly came to Tang Xiu and asked, “Can I go with him to Qinglin  County? I haven’t had a shower for a couple of days and it’s quite  uncomfortable.”</p><p>“No.” Tang Xiu shook his head and said, “I can rest my worries if  it’s only Jin Shi going by himself, but if you follow him, Dao Master  Poison would definitely make you suffer under his hands if Jin Shi’s  identity is exposed. Just endure it. Besides, we’ll be leaving in two  days at the most.”</p><p>A disappointed look flashed in Zhang Xinyue’s eyes and she said  bitterly, “This is my first time not having a bath for such a long time  ever since I was a child. It’s really too unbearable. These are also  your clothes, overcoat, your underwear…”</p><p>Tang Xiu could only force a wry smile inwardly. The thought of him  bringing several sets of women’s clothes and underwear inside his  interspatial had never crossed his mind. But they were in such a  situation where he didn’t want to let Zhang Xinyue risk her life,  especially since he already made her be in such a humiliating state.</p><p>Suddenly, his expression changed and he looked hesitant before he  said, “I can actually help you if you wanna have a shower. It’s just…”</p><p>Zhang Xinyue looked pleasantly surprised and asked, “I can have a shower really? What’s the ‘but’, exactly?”</p><p>Tang Xiu firmed himself and explained, “You can have it by arranging  some arrays. But I have to be nearby when you take a shower, at least no  less than ten meters.”</p><p>“What?” a blush appeared on Zhang Xinyue’s pretty face. But since she  thought that she already had skinship with Tang Xiu, her reply was just  a simple, “That’s fine with me, as long as you don’t peep on me.”</p><p>Tang Xiu secretly sighted inside and said, “Alright, let’s go back to  the cave! It’s safe staying outside, but there’s also the possibility  of getting found out after arranging the array.”</p><p>With that said, he turned back to the cave and quickly arranged the  formation of the Auspicious Rain Array and set up an Averting Array  around it. Then, he said, “Enter inside and take off your clothes. But  do your shower fast, about ten minutes at max, else you won’t have hot  water there.”</p><p>‘Undress myself there?’</p><p>However straightforward Zhang Xinyue’s character was, she was  somewhat bashful and hesitated before she asked, “Can you turn around?  I…”</p><p>Tang Xiu took out toiletries from his interspatial ring and handed  them to her, “Don’t worry! As long as you enter the arrays, nobody  outside can see anything inside, but you inside are still able to see  the scene outside.”</p><p>“For real?” Zhang Xinyue still hesitated and confirmed more.</p><p>Tang Xiu didn’t answer her but directly entered the array. Much to  Zhang Xinyue’s surprise, Tang Xiu’s figure suddenly vanished from her  sight after he walked a few steps forward. It was as if he had vanished  out of thin air.</p><p>After a while, Tang Xiu came out of the array and looked at Zhang Xinyue before saying, “You believe me now, don’t you?”</p><p>Zhang Xinyue happily nodded and walked into the array. Her clothes  were drenched by the rain inside, but she was unable to bear the cold  rainwater that made her shiver, and she backtracked hurriedly. There was  an angry look on her face as he asked aloud, “Hey, didn’t you say  there’s hot water inside? How come the rain here is so cold?”</p><p>“I already told you to undress first before stepping inside, didn’t  I?” said Tang Xiu helplessly. “Do you see the line over there? You can  undress after you walk past that line and then pass through the second  one where the rain will shower on you. So, after you walk past the first  line, you need to wait for ten seconds before the rainwater turns hot.”</p><p>“Eh? What’s the cause for that?” asked Zhang Xinyue with visible curiosity on her face.</p><p>“It’s because I’m using supernatural power to wrap this Auspicious  Rain Shower Array.” Tang Xiu forced a wry smile and continued, “The high  temperature of the fire will cause the rain to heat up while the array  is not destroyed. Ah, forget it. You won’t understand it even if I tell  you anyway. Just hurry up if you wanna have a shower, I don’t have  enough magical power to make it last for a long time.”</p><p>“Alright.”</p><p>Zhang Xinyue stepped back into the array. Though she was still  hesitating when undressing, she chose to believe Tang Xiu after she  witnessed him disappear a while ago. After walking past the second line  stark naked, she could clearly see Tang Xiu standing outside the array  with both hands creating some seals and setting a layer of flame to burn  the part past the second line from the outside.</p><p>She felt bashful inwardly because the moment she got naked, Tang Xiu  was standing seven-plus meters away in front. But she was also shocked  because of this mystical formation array, as well as the flame that  enveloped it from the outside.</p><p>After the water temperature was heating up and the chilling cold  finally disappeared, she washed quickly with that bit of shyness. It  could be said that this shower was the fastest and most embarrassing one  she had ever had in her life. After all, she could watch Tang Xiu just  over seven meters away from her while taking a bath, causing a tidal  wave of emotion that rippled inside her heart.</p><p>She couldn’t help but recall that scene of skinship she had that  night—the taste of ecstasy of reaching the peak—and those scenes of the  passionate collision between them.</p><p>“Hurry up! I can only support it for two minutes more.”</p><p>Tang Xiu’s voice could be heard from outside.</p><p>Zhang Xinyue’s washing speed increased after hearing that. A minute  later, she asked aloud, “I am done bathing. But if you end your support,  will the water temperature suddenly cool down?”</p><p>“Do you still remember those two lines I told you? Walk past there and you’re done,” said Tang Xiu.</p><p>“Got it!” replied Zhang Xineyue to Tang Xiu. But after she stepped  outside, only then did she suddenly realize that Tang Xiu gave her  toiletries before she took a bath but didn’t give her clean clothes.</p><p>Tang Xiu’s face was a bit pale. He constantly generated fire with his  magical power and was quite spent at this time. After stopping the  spell, he took out a whole set of clean clothes from the interspatial  ring without a word, placed them on the bed in the cave, and then said,  “Here are the clothes you can wear. I’m going out first.”</p><p>Outside the cave.</p><p>Xue Sha and Hei Xiong were hiding in the bushes while keeping an eye  of distance areas with their mini binoculars as they sensed that someone  was approaching them. The two men turned back and immediately saw Tang  Xiu, then made a ‘silence’ hand signal as Xue Sha then leaned toward  Tang Xiu and whispered, “Have a look at four o’clock—about 450 meters  away from us, Boss. Someone from Qingcheng Monastery is over there;  we’ve been observing that spot for some time. He’s alone and now is  hiding while resting amid the thick grasses over there.”</p><p>Tang Xiu frowned and asked, “From which direction did he come from?”</p><p>“From Qinglin County’s direction. It seems that he’s heading to the Qingcheng Monastery,” answered Xue Sha.”</p><p>After staying silent for a while, Tang Xiu said, “You two, stay here  to protect Zhang Xinyue. I’ll follow him to see what he’s doing.”</p><p>“Won’t it be dangerous for you, Boss?” asked Xue Sha, looking worried.</p><p>“Relax!” Tang Xiu shook his head and said, “Before Awu comes back,  I’ll immediately run away if I encounter Dao Master Poison on the way  there. Wanting to kill me won’t be that easy as long as that old fogy  doesn’t use his poison.”</p><p>Ten minutes later, Tang Xiu secretly tailed the expert of Qingcheng  Monastery who had already rested and was now quickly heading toward the  direction of the monastery. After several hours of running, he finally  appeared near the exterior of the Daoist Temple which had stopped  burning. The man then hid in the dark, and after observing around for  some time, he walked out of the bushes and knelt down before the  burnt-out Daoist temple. Afterward, he thumped his head on the ground a  few times, then headed northward speedily.</p><p>The man’s movements were very light and he was also very vigilant as  he observed any disturbances in the surroundings from time to time. Upon  coming to the ruins of the now collapsed tallest building, his figure  rushed northwest and appeared in another courtyard in just half a  minute.</p><p>Tang Xiu passed by him and watched the Qingcheng Monastery’s man  enter a wing-room of the building. After releasing his spiritual sense,  he was surprised to see that man held a celadon vase that was more than a  meter wide. He turned it around hard, and the originally tightly-shut  wall slowly opened, revealing a wide staircase to the room below.</p><p>Tang Xiu followed him. At the moment when the man was walking farther  along the ladder and the wall was about to close, he instantly rushed  inside.</p><p>“Wang Feng.”</p><p>A few voices came fast, followed by a few figures that appeared in front of that man.</p><p>The man, who was called Wang Feng, burst into tears when he saw the  men before him. He hugged each one of them hard and then said bitterly,  “Our Qingcheng school is literally over. Only eight survive of the 64  people who usually lived above. For the sake of preventing you all from  making unnecessary sacrifices, the Head Abbot didn’t allow us to open  this dungeon and let you all out.”</p><p>A burly middle-aged man hurried asked, “How is the Abbot now?”</p><p>“He’s safe, but Deputy Abbot passed away,” answered Wang Feng. “I  received an order from the Abbot to come back here and quietly take you  out and flee as fast as possible.”</p><p>Several middle-aged men fell into silence for a while. One of them  then pulled out a group of keys and said, “I’m going to open cells’  door. We can’t let them die here, even if they did make a mistake in the  past.”</p><p>“Yes!” the rest nodded without objection.</p><p>A few minutes later, the six cells’ doors were opened and six men and  women—members of the Qingcheng Monastery who had made mistakes and were  held here—came out fast, one of whom was a young man who was the  quickest to come out.</p><p>‘Wang Rui?’</p><p>Tang Xiu, who was hiding in the corner by the ladder, could clearly  see with his spiritual sense that the young man was Wang Rui.</p><p>Wang Rui quickly ran to the few people and hurriedly asked, “How is the situation above? Has the enemy left yet?”</p><p>“They haven’t left yet, but they are still searching for our  monastery’s people in the vicinity of Qingcheng Mountain,” said Wang  Feng bitterly. “Only eight have survived above including me, and the  Abbot says that the surviving members of our school must hurry up to  escape.”</p><p>Wang Rui’s pupils shrunk and he suddenly grabbed Wang Feng’s arm and asked, “What about my father? Where’s he?”</p><p>Wang Feng’s expression turned dark and he answered, “Wang Rui, please  restrain your grief and accept the inevitable. The powerful enemy  caught up with the Deputy Abbot when he ran away to Qinglin County, and  he… he died.”</p><p>“WHAT?!!” Wang Rui’s body trembled and his entire being froze on the spot.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
