He then received a call from Zhu Long, informing him that they would assemble in Jingmen Island 3 days later. He paid no heed to the indifference in his tone since he thought that Zhu Long just thought that he was very capable, thus leading to his big temper.</p><p>He only had a little time for cultivating recently. Even though he spent a few hours to cultivate every day, the progress was too slow for the tens of thousands of planes inside his Dantian which were like babies starving for food. Only by seizing the time to cultivate could they be developed and quickly become real planets, each containing enormous energy.</p><p>There was one thing that he felt grateful about, however. He still had a lot of Demon Stone in his interspatial ring. As long as he absorbed the demonic energy contained in these stones, the first planet in his Dantian should be completely formed into a real energy planet in the truest sense. Also, even though medicinal pills are only slightly effective on him, it was at least better than nothing at all. He could refine tons of medicinal pills as long as he had sufficient resources.</p><p><em>‘The increase in physical strength should be the bottleneck. If I want to improve it, then I need a higher level of Body Tempering Liquid. Blood Seizing Pill is very suitable for this purpose, but the materials needed to refine it are very demanding and it has almost reached the limit of the top materials on Earth. I got a massive number of medicinal herbs from the mountain in Mist Source Island and I have one or two kinds of ores that can substitute for the materials, but the bones of fierce beasts…’</em></p><p><em>‘The bones of the low-rank fierce beast will no longer have any effect while using mid-rank fierce beast’s bones is also a no go. Unless I have tons of them to extract the essence from, I will have no way to refine Blood Seizing Pill at all. Earth does have high-ranking fierce beasts that exist such as the terrifying beast on the island of Evil Dragon Sea Area, or the living Fire Qilin in the sky crater of a mountain nearby Cangbei City.’</em></p><p><em>‘With my current strength, however, killing this level of the fierce beast is simply a crazed dream. Chimei or Yan’er may be able to do it, but it will definitely trigger the suppression of Heavenly Dao in this plane that is likely to cause a great backlash to them and expel them from this plane. So, counting on them is a no go either.’</em></p><p>Tang Xiu sat in meditation next to the window while staring at the green scenery outside, countless thoughts churning out in his mind. To turn all the planets inside his Dantian world to become real planets made of energy was not something that could be done overnight. However, enhancing his physical strength and cultivating the Heavenly Art of Cosmic Genesis to a higher level could have been easily achieved as long as he had adequate resources.</p><p><em>‘If I were in the Immortal World, it would have been easier to buy the cultivation resources I needed. Even if I have to provide tons of money.’</em></p><p>With a faint regret hidden within, Tang Xiu took out the Demon Stone and absorbed it while cultivating. He had become aware of the fact that he had inadequate strength due to the encounters he faced recently. Regardless of whether it was the divergent races from Stygian Club, those Elementalists from Pyramid, or the mutants from Savage Mammoth, all of them had formidable strength. Even if the present him was very strong, he still had some room for improvement in areas where he was lacking. Despite having a lot of cards up his sleeves that he could use, he would still likely die in the hands of his enemies should he face too many powerful experts besieging him.</p><p>Most important of all was that he was about to enter the three-star vestige soon and explore it to obtain some treasures. Of course, he also knew very well that the better the harvest, the greater the risk is. He also didn’t dare to try the current might of science and technology of today. He knew that he would be smashed into pieces once that terrifying might of technology was directed against him.</p><p>In any case, strength is forever a benefit, no less.</p><p>Having mighty strength was very urgent to him as only becoming stronger could he get more good things. In the situation such as him solving the crisis on Mist Source Island, the huge number of jades that he obtained, along with the various resources he found in the center of the mountain, were definitely full of profits for him.</p><p>Early the next morning, after finishing his cultivation, Tang Xiu took a shower and came to the living room on the first floor. He saw that the housekeeper, Zhang Xinlan, was cleaning, while the drifting fragrance of the meal in the kitchen awoke his appetite.</p><p>“Would you like to have breakfast now, Mr. Tang?” asked Zhang Xinlan.</p><p>“Please!” replied Tang Xiu with a smile.</p><p>Zhang Xinlan put down the cleaning mop in her hand and was about to walk to the kitchen when she suddenly recalled something and then said, “By the way, a friend of yours came over a couple of days ago, Mr. Tang. He said that it’s urgent and he wanted to see you. You were not here and I didn’t know how to contact you, so he left.”</p><p>“Which friend, what’s his name?” asked Tang Xiu.</p><p>“He said his name is Long Zhenglin. He’s quite tall and baldly shaved,” answered Zhang Xinlan.</p><p>Tang Xiu raised his brows and nodded. After seeing Zhang Xinlan go to the kitchen, he took his mobile out and dialed Long Zhenglin’s number.</p><p>“Yo, Tang Big Bro?” Long Zhenglin’s weary voice transmitted out of the phone.</p><p>“What’s wrong with your mood, Brother? You sound listless,” asked Tang Xiu with a smile. “Did you indulge yourself too much last night and haven’t yet recovered your blood or something?”</p><p>“Dude, I’ve been abstinent for a long time, alright?” Long Zhenglin’s yawning voice could be heard and he groaned, “It’s you, who is indulging in partying with wine and women every night and day, aren’t you? Anyways, let’s cut the crap. I came over to look for you a couple of days ago you know. It’s something urgent and I need your help, but I couldn’t contact you back then.”</p><p>“What urgent thing, exactly?” asked Tang Xiu, surprised.</p><p>“I wanna borrow some money, what else?” Long Zhenglin forced a wry smile and said, “I originally asked my Dad and Brother first to borrow the money. Who had ever thought they were so poor that they couldn’t even take out 12 million yuan? Anyways, it’s a pity that I can’t buy that Red Silk Flower, darn it! I heard that thing is very valuable and you can fetch a sky-high price if you’re able to get one and sell it abroad.”</p><p>Red Silk Flower?</p><p>Tang Xiu was dumbfounded. As though he recalled something about what this fella was talking about, he hurriedly asked, “What is this Red Silk Flower you talked about? It shouldn’t be a very rare medicinal herb, no?”</p><p>“Eh?” Long Zhengling was surprised and asked, “You know something about this Red Silk Flower?”</p><p>After asking, he then remembered Tang Xiu was also a Chinese medical practitioner and immediately heaved a relieved sigh, “Yup, that’s the thing, I guess. It seems like that stuff fetches a huge price in the foreign market. But unfortunately, that darn profiteer has no connection overseas whatsoever. Though, the Red Silk Flower can’t be exposed to light, so he was willing to sell it for 12 million yuan to that bastard from Qingcheng Mountain.”</p><p>“Where are you now, then?” asked Tang Xiu with a deep voice. “Let’s meet up.”</p><p>As if realizing something, Long Zhenglin asked, “You want that Red Silk Flower too?”</p><p>“Definitely,” answered Tang Xiu without thinking. “That thing is a treasure that I urgently need now. Just hurry up and tell me where you are. Let’s just meet up and we’ll talk again then.”</p><p>“I’m in Mingyuan Resort, Tianjing City,” said Long Zhenglin. “Oh, that’s right. Bring some money before you come here. I got done in, got cheated by a bunch of assholes recently that has left me with just my fucking pants. Just deduct it from my end-year dividend from Magnificent Tang Corp.”</p><p>“Got it.”</p><p>Tang Xiu didn’t ask who the people who had conned Long Zhenlin were. What he needed to know was the whereabouts of this Red Silk Flower. This flower was the best main material to refine either the Body Tempering Liquid or the Blood Seizing Pill. It had the best compatibility and also had a frightening fission property, which were two effects that were indispensable for the enhancement of a cultivator’s body.</p><p>“I’m a bit in a hurry so I’m not going to have breakfast at home.”</p><p>Tang Xiu informed Zhang Xinlan and hurriedly left Bluestar Villa Complex. He only brought Mo Awu this time to head to Tianjing City, leaving Jin Shi and the rest to stay. Shanghai was very close to Tianjing City and could be reached within two hours of driving.</p><p>9:30 in the morning, Tang Xiu and Mo Awu arrived at the Mingyuan Resort, Tianjing City. However, Tang Xiu was stunned when he found that this resort was a high-class resort and didn’t accept non-members. Therefore, he could only call Long Zhenglin to come out and pick him up.</p><p>“Hahaha, dude! Never thought there’d be a day where you’d be defeated. Weren’t you, Big Bro? This Mingyuan Resort belongs to my buddy. You can only get a membership card here if you spend tons of money and have a referral. Anyways, let’s go in! I already told some people to prepare some meals and wine, I was just waiting for you to come to dine together.” Long Zhenglin caressed his big bald head with an especially big grin on his face.</p><p>Tang Xiu had no leisure to eat and drink and directly asked instead, “You said the Red Silk Flower had been bought by someone from Qingcheng Mountain, right? Who was it?”</p><p>“Dude, don’t you know haste makes waste or whatever?” Long Zhenglin rolled his eyes and said, “Even if I tell you now, you can’t get that Red Silk Flower for the time being. That fella from Qingcheng Mountain already left Tianjing City two days ago, got it?”</p><p>Hearing about this, Tang Xiu forcefully suppressed his internal desires and followed Long Zhenglin into the inside of Mingyuan Resort. The venue had an excellent environment. It was still early summer, but a conglomeration of splendid and multicolored flowers had blossomed, complementing each other in an overall feast for the eyes. The layout and pattern here were designed according to Feng Shui auspiciousness, making it a good place for self-moral cultivation as well as a venue for leisure and recreation.</p><p>“Tang Big Bro, the owner of this place is called Ren Qi, quite a VIP in Tianjing City if you ask me. His family is one of the top five here. I had a brawl with him the first time I came to Tianjing since we didn’t know each other, but then, we eventually became buddies,” said Long Zhenglin happily.</p><p>“I’ve got no interest in this Ren Qi guy, you know,” said Tang Xiu.</p><p>Long Zhenglin rolled his eyes in response and led Tang Xiu to head straight to the coffee shop of the Mingyuan Resort. It was still morning but the coffee shop had already opened. There were even a few guests who were currently chatting while drinking their coffee. They picked the table randomly and after taking a seat, Long Zhenglin said, “I know you’re in a hurry and impatient, so I’ll tell you about the situation first. The name of the guy who bought the Red Silk Flower is Wang Tao. I heard he’s quite famous in the Qingcheng Mountain region. I don’t know about his background, specifically speaking, but he’s always surrounded by a bunch of bodyguards every time he shows up in public. Kind of enough proof that he has some deep background, don’t you think? I think he should be related to the Wang Family of Qingcheng Mountain.”</p><p>The Qingcheng Mountain’s Wang Family?</p><p>Tang Xiu frowned and asked, “You know, I have an acquaintance in Qingcheng Mountain. His name is Wang Rui.”</p><p>“Never heard of him.” Long Zhenglin shook his head.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
