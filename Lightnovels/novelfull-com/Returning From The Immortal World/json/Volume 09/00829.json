In spite of the fact that his grandson controlled the entire three-star vestige, he understood the truth that no human could swallow more than he could chew. Those big shots in China were not necessarily able to endure their greed when meeting such powerful technology. Who among them wouldn’t use it to assemble a powerful army to destroy the balance of world powers and become the ruler of the world?</p><p>“So, what do you need the most now, Xiu’er?”</p><p>Tang Guosheng knew that his grandson was a cultivator, so he began to wonder about what would benefit him the most.</p><p>Tang Xiu pondered for a while and slowly said, “I need time.”</p><p>Tang Guosheng was stunned and asked again, “How long?”</p><p>“At the very least, more than ten years,” answered Tang Xiu. “The current Earth has a minimal number of cultivation resources, resulting in my cultivation progressing at a crawl. Grandpa, as long as I have enough time, I can make sure nothing will threaten the Tang Family, regardless of the balance of world powers in the future.”</p><p>Tang Guosheng nodded without a word, yet he felt that the ten years his grandson needed was too short—it wouldn’t be long enough for him to cultivate and become a true powerhouse. For example, the Amur Tiger, Dongbei Hu. How much time of his 200 years in life did he spend cultivating?</p><p>“Alright. Let’s put this all together and see what we can do to make our country more powerful. But we must not overdo it and make them become powerful too quickly.”</p><p>“Alright.”</p><p>Immediately after, the grandfather and grandson duo began discussing as Tang Xiu took out a lot of items from his interspatial ring. After inspecting each object, they finally determined what several types of them were. In addition to the Subaquatic Corvette they were now on, they picked up a kind of manufacturing device that could produce consumer goods, as well as several energy crystals.</p><p>“This Subaquatic Corvette we are riding on has more than a dozen weapon configurations. The one that is the most powerful is the underwater laser cannon as it can blast an entire small island. Hence, I’m going to dismantle its main gun and leave behind some other less powerful weapon systems. I believe that after the executives of our country obtain this Subaquatic Corvette, three to five years of researching it won’t be enough to achieve a notable result. Even if they can research it thoroughly in eight to ten years, they would be able to use the scientific and technological achievements they have researched to manufacture a large number of Subaquatic Corvettes, so we don’t need to worry about it,” concluded Tang Xiu at the end of discussion.</p><p>Tang Guosheng nodded with satisfaction and smilingly said, “Well, I know that our country’s top officials will grin ear to ear even if we give them this Subaquatic Corvette with half of its weapons dismantled. For what reason can our country not become the most powerful country in the world? Is there anything forbidding it to be first in military power? Is possessing powerful weapons a mistake?”</p><p>“We’re Chinese nationals, so it’s natural that we want our country to possess stronger weapons and improve our country’s army to the highest extent possible. But then, I would hope that the high-level officials of our country are not blinded with ambition later,” said Tang Xiu with a smile.</p><p>Even if he spoke like that, he could tell that once China’s military power became the strongest in the world and surpassed the United States, the bigshots in China would definitely implement some plans that would, at the very least, cause some changes to the current balance of the world.</p><p>China was like a sleeping lion. It was getting stronger after its awakening and was currently a first world country. But a lion would always be a lion. Regardless of how many years a lion stayed calm in its territory, it would definitely want to establish itself in the vast territory of the entire forest once its strength was at its peak.</p><p>Tang Xiu also wished for his country to become stronger and more powerful, but he needed more time to make himself stronger first. He realized that before he gained the ability to ascend in the future, his time to play on this planet hadn’t finished yet.</p><p>Knock, knock…</p><p>A knock was at the door, and Cheng Xuemei, who didn’t participate in the discussion, moved inside. She looked at Tang Xiu and quickly said, “The sensor just showed a holographic image of some people approaching us. If I guess correctly, they should be Americans.”</p><p>Tang Xiu and Tang Guosheng exchanged glances and both wore a surprised expression. But Tang Min was puzzled and asked, “Americans are approaching us? Are they like those French ability users, wanting to rob us of the precious objects from the three-star vestige?”</p><p>“They should be,” replied Tang Guosheng thoughtfully. “The United States has always seen itself as the hegemon of the world. Not to mention that all the powerhouses they dispatched were completely annihilated in the three-star vestige, and in addition, it’s impossible to send out another expedition to gain any more treasures. Hence, I’m guessing that they are now targeting the precious objects from the vestige that have been obtained by other countries’ expedition teams.</p><p>“Let’s go to the pilothouse and have a look,” interjected Tang Xiu.</p><p>Afterward, the five people came to the pilothouse and watched the footage displayed on the virtual holographic screen. A cold gleam flashed in Tang Xiu’s eyes since dozens of people on the U.S. cargo ship were obviously not just average people. The looks that they had when watching the two liners clearly expressed their evil intention.</p><p>“These Americans are really brazen, just because their country is strong and has advanced weapons!” said Tang Guosheng coldly. “Do you see that man atop the roof of the cargo ship? His name is Dorot, the Golden Shield leader of USA’s Special Ability Bureau. His position is similar to Duanmu Lin’s but with higher privileges.”</p><p>“How did you know that, Father?” asked Tang Min, puzzled.</p><p>“I used to work in the confidential archives department, so I naturally saw some special intel files,” answered Tang Guosheng. “There are records about this Dorot, but they didn’t contain much.”</p><p>“But then why weren’t you able to recognize the identity of any French ability users back then, though?” asked Tang Min curiously.</p><p>“The French ability users are a very low-key bunch,” Tang Guosheng shook his head and said, “The fact that France has established its own Special Ability Bureau is also news to me. I don’t even know who the person in charge is, nor do I know how many ability users they have. Also, those French are not as aggressive as the Americans, so naturally we’ve been paying more attention to the intelligence towards the USA.</p><p>Tang Min caught the gist quickly. She looked at Tang Xiu and asked, “How do we deal with them, Xiu’er?”</p><p>Tang Xiu was silent for a while and then slowly said, “If Grandpa doesn’t like them and we don’t want any more casualties, then we can only annihilate them.”</p><p>Tang Guosheng was still before he quizzically asked, “There’s no way we can avoid casualties if we must fight them, right? Those Americans are not, by any means, paper tigers. Aren’t you boasting a bit too much, Xiu’er?”</p><p>A smile appeared on Tang Xiu’s face. His hands quickly tapped on the virtual keyboard as he set up a series of instructions. At the same time, all the turrets of the guns installed on the twenty-plus meter long Subaquatic Corvette’s hull began to adjust their aim. Meanwhile, the weapon power generator began to run at full steam.</p><p>Six kilometers away.</p><p>The cargo ship was slowly approaching the two anchored liners. Dorot stood atop the roof of the cargo ship. There was uncertainty on his face while his fingers steadily stroked his chin gently. The smiling belle that stood next to him already had her smile gone, replaced by a look of seriousness.</p><p>“You have to consider it again, Dorot. There were originally four powerful experts on those two Chinese liners, and later came two more experts that are much more powerful. Just by relying on those six, they can completely overpower us. The one who’ll be completely annihilated will be us if we attack them,” said the beauty in a cold voice.</p><p>Dorot turned to look at the belle, then took a deep breath and said, “I know that the enemy is very powerful. I admit that I won’t be able to handle the original four experts, whereas those two people who appeared later are also probably stronger than me. But don’t forget what our modified cargo ship has been equipped with. I have made up my mind to approach them and unleash it immediately.”</p><p>The beauty was silent for a few seconds and finally nodded slowly. She naturally knew what kind of weapon had been installed on the modified cargo ship.</p><p>“But can the torpedoes blow up those two liners? Can those naval mines completely kill or cause heavy damages to those powerful people?” The beautiful woman still faintly worried inside.</p><p>“You know, those Chinese have an old saying that I love the most. Do you want me to say it?” Dorot shook his head and asked.</p><p>“What do you wanna say, exactly?” asked the belle, curious.</p><p>“They say that you won’t be able to catch a cub if you don’t enter a tiger’s den,” said Dorot in a deep voice. “We’ll ultimately get nothing if we give up this plan because we are afraid of their combat force. Besides, if those Chinese experts bring the objects they obtained from the three-star vestige to their country, we can expect the Chinese military power to surpass us within a few years. By then, they will take away our biggest asset.”</p><p>“I…”</p><p>As the beautiful woman opened her mouth and was about to concur with Dorot’s argument, a nagging and restless feeling suddenly erupted inside her heart, causing all the hairs on her body to stand upright.</p><p>“RUN…”</p><p>The beautiful woman didn’t know what danger it was or where it came from, but she instantly dashed to the side towards the sea. She then grabbed an iron chain on the hull and twisted it off to forcefully pull down a small boat.</p><p>“BOOM…”</p><p>The huge explosion created torrential blasts of waves as the whole cargo ship was blown up in an instant. Apart from a handful of the American ability users who had sensed that something was amiss, the other tens of ability users from the USA Special Ability Bureau were either heavily injured or dead after the explosion.</p><p>Inside the Subaquatic Corvette.</p><p>Tang Guosheng and Tang Min were shocked by the cannon’s attack. They learned from Tang Xiu that it was not even the Subaquatic Corvette’s main gun. If it was a blast from the main weapon, wouldn’t it only need one shot to annihilate the other party completely?</p><p>“Well, this is just the start of a good show, though,” said Tang Xiu smilingly. “I’ve already activated the intelligent tracking and locking system. Those American ability users won’t be able to run anywhere.”</p><p>Cheng Xuemei, who stood behind Tang Xiu, hurriedly said, “Are you perhaps not going to leave behind some of them to obtain intel from, like regarding the American Special Ability Bureau?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
