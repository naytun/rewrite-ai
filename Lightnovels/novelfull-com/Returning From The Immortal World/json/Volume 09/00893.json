Accurately speaking, they had just been sent to open a new Everlasting Feast Hall’s branch there and the security they had was quite recognizable.</p><p>Hu Zhiwu was the General Manager of Macao’s Everlasting East Hall, as well as the one in charge for the intelligence network. He was only in his early thirties, yet he was someone who had made substantial footmarks in the mercenary and assassination world. He looked gentle like a weak scholar on the surface, but he was known as a ruthless killer who could kill without batting an eye to those who knew him.</p><p>“Ajin, what’s the situation with the medicinal herbs issue?”</p><p>Hu Zhiwu was now inside the branch office, looking solemn as he stood before the window while asking with his back against the youth behind him.</p><p>The youth was twenty-seven something looking, with a monkey-like face which had eyes flickering with intelligence. Upon hearing Hu Zhiwu’s question, he nodded and said, “I’ve used all the money you gave me as per your instruction, Manager. It’s just that the precious medicinal herbs are kinda expensive nowadays, so I can only buy a few of them.”</p><p>Hu Zhiwu nodded after hearing his answer, “However few we have, just give them to me and I’ll squeeze some time to send them to Jingmen Island to get some pills so I can break through to the mid-stage of Foundation Establishment earlier.”</p><p>“Alright!” the youth hurriedly nodded.</p><p>Ring, ring, ring…</p><p>One of the two cell phones on the desktop suddenly rang.</p><p>Hu Zhiwu blanked out for a moment and his countenance immediately changed. He had two handsets; one was used as his private number, and the one that was ringing now was a mission call from the Everlasting Feast Hall. Whenever that ringtone sounded, that meant he had an important mission to carry out.</p><p>After he picked it up, Hu Zhiwu said in a deep voice, “Hu Zhiwu speaking.”</p><p>“I’m Tang Xiu.” Tang Xiu’s voice was coming out from the phone.</p><p>The moment Hu Zhiwu heard the name, his face turned respectful and reverently said, “Are you looking for me, Boss?”</p><p>“Yeah. I heard you’re in Macao; is that right? If so, there’s something I need you to do,” said Tang Xiu.</p><p>“Please do tell, Boss,” replied Hu Zhiwu respectfully.</p><p>Tang Xiu told him the issue and finally concluded in a deep voice, “Take some men to keep an eye on the situation at Conrad Hotel, and record and report to me about those who check in and out of the hotel. If you find anyone suspicious, keep monitoring them closely. Also, some of our Everlasting Feast Hall’s people will be coming from headquarters as fast as possible. You should assist them when they arrive while you’re monitoring all the various channels of the whole island. Once we recognize their identity, you and they are to target them. Make sure to make them stay put.”</p><p>“Understood. I’ll arrange it right away.”</p><p>Hu Zhiwu could tell the seriousness of the mission and answered with a solemn look. After hanging up, he immediately called the youth and said in a deep voice, “A Jin, we’ll put the medicinal herbs issue on hold for the time being as there’s more important thing we must do now.”</p><p>“Was the person who just called you the Big Boss?” asked A Jin.</p><p>“Yeah, he personally issued the order and we must accomplish it perfectly.” Hu Zhiwu nodded and said, “Thus, you are to immediately gather all of our security force…”</p><p>Macao city port.</p><p>A passenger liner slowly anchored and, after the passenger had disembarked, Tang Yunde saw a middle-aged man on the coast with four bodyguards in black attire protecting him as he quickly approached to greet the man.</p><p>“Anhu!”</p><p>Tang Yunde smiled beamingly and strode fast to greet him. He and the middle-aged man hugged each other. It was the second time for Tang Yunde to meet his comrade-in-arms after he woke up from his comatose state.</p><p>“You finally came here, Yunde,” said Chen Anhu excitedly.</p><p>“I received your call and immediately rushed here. Don’t worry, though. I’m coming to solve your problem this time,” replied Tang Yunde with a smile.</p><p>“That’s the concern I’ve been worrying about, Yunde. I think I really need you to solve it this time,” Chen Anhu let out a bitter smile upon hearing it. “The said party I told you about has a big background and is backed by the Zhao Family from Beijing who support them with a group of experts from abroad. I really can’t hold them much longer.”</p><p>Tang Yunde patted his shoulder and said, “I brought a lot of men this time, but they have already come here through other means in order not to be noticed by those people though. Alright, shall we go now? I kinda spotted some suspicious people just as I got off the liner nearby.”</p><p>Chen Anhu’s complexion slightly changed as he nodded and said, “Let’s.”</p><p>Macao, an hour later at Island Palace Garden in the Tangxia residential block.</p><p>The district was the most upscale luxurious villa complex in the whole of Macao; those who could reside here were all wealthy and respectable people. The block had a total of 100 villas and covered a large area with each villa located in an extremely private and secretive location quite far from each other.</p><p>At villa A-058</p><p>Tang Yunde and Chen Anhu were sitting in the study on the second floor, but both of them had a cloudy expression. Right now, even their fragrant scented tea didn’t evoke their interest to taste it.</p><p>“Tell me the specific situation here, Anhu.”</p><p>Chen Anhu nodded and said, “The Zhang Family we are facing against in Macao this time is also one of the giant families who control 60% of casinos in the whole Macao. The Zhangs had been kind of low-key in the past and can be said to be making a big fortune while staying low-profile. They are very different now, however, due to a very proud and talented young man popping out of this family. He’s still 28-years-old, yet he has replaced his grandfather and became the real decision maker of the Zhangs. Furthermore, the Zhangs began to reform their industries after he took the helm several years ago. And now, their businesses are not only limited to gambling establishments, but they have also expanded to real estate, jewelry, and the car industry. Rumors have it that the Zhangs even also had several mines in Africa.”</p><p>Tang Yunde narrowed his eyes. It reminded him of his son’s ability which made him unable to look down on this talented and gifted young man from the Zhang Family. Since the Zhang Family was so powerful, however, this meant the issue couldn’t be as simple as it looked on the surface. His coming here was likely to have some other variables and risk factors.</p><p>“So, the Zhangs have the Spirit Shaker Martial School under their control now then?”</p><p>Chen Anhu nodded and said, “I’ve sent some people to investigate it. It’s not only the Spirit Shaker Martial School, but even the Black Garb Company is also controlled by the Zhangs. This company is the largest security company in Macao with nearly 1,000 security guards. The investigation also showed that these security guards are not ordinary security guards; some of them have quite a diverse background.”</p><p>Tang Yunde was silent for a few minutes. After smoking a cigarette, he slowly said, “The two ports have always been our most profitable business and freight shipping is very important here. It’s just absolutely impossible for the Zhangs to strong arm and force us to hand over the ports with their powerful force. We’ll see that freakish talent of the Zhang tomorrow. If he’s really powerful, then I can only ask for aid from outside.”</p><p>“Seeking aid from outside?” Chen Anhu was stunned and asked, “What exactly do you mean?”</p><p>“You know. Find some people to help us; what else?” said Tang Yunde as he forced a smile.</p><p>Chen Anhu quickly caught the gist and said with a nod, “We would be able to suppress the Zhang if the Tang Family acted indeed. I believe they won’t dare to oppose your family for those two ports.”</p><p>“No. It’s not my family.” Tang Yunde shook his head and said, “The person I’m looking for is my son.”</p><p>Chen Anhu was utterly dumbfounded and at a loss whether he had to cry or laugh, “You’re looking for help from your son, Yunde? Are you joking with me? He’s doing a great job with his business on the mainland, but there’s no way his hands have reached Macao, no?”</p><p>“I know my son very well,” said Tang Yunde. “He can solve the problem easily, even if we can’t.”</p><p>Chen Anhu shook his head and couldn’t help but wryly smile. He had heard of Tang Xiu from Tang Yunde. He had established the Magnificent Tang Corporation by virtue of his own hands at a young age. His entire company had been rapidly expanding and catching up with the large enterprises in China at present. And yet, Tang Xiu wouldn’t be able to extend his reach to Macao by himself without the aid of the Tang Family whatsoever.</p><p>Late at night at the Conrad Hotel.</p><p>In the presidential suite on the 24th floor, the silver-haired youth was hugging two blonde foreign girls as they laid on the king-sized bed. Nearby, five old men in black robes were sitting cross-legged in meditation around a small round table as though they were monks in meditation.</p><p>Only, the jade rat that was previously on that table had now disappeared.</p><p>The petite woman, however, was now standing before the big window, watching the situation around the hotel through the curtains with a telescope. She had been observing for more than ten minutes and was pretty sure that some people were acting suspiciously.</p><p>“Kitty, being too excessively suspicious will just tire you out. Preserving your strength is the most important thing about keeping yourself safe. Rather than observing the outside at this time, you might as well go back to your room to cultivate,” one of the old men who sat cross-legged suddenly opened his eyes and spoke.</p><p>The petite woman turned while putting down her telescope. Then she said, “Regardless of how strong I am, there’s no way I can fully guarantee the safety of Young Master if I can’t spot danger promptly. Besides, we have you guys here. I may be quite weak, but as long as I can spot danger in advance, I can alert you to prepare a defense in time.”</p><p>The old man in a black robe shook his head. The five of them brought this child up and were naturally aware of her nature and thoughts. Even though their Young Master loved beauties and was often promiscuous, she still loved him and even stubbornly believed that she would become his woman one day.</p><p>Unfortunately, the five of them were perfectly aware that if their Young Master usurped the power of the Raven Clan, he mustn’t fall in love with nor marry any woman.</p><p>“Just go back to your room and rest!” The black-robed old man closed his eyes again and slowly said.</p><p>“No.” The petite woman shook her head and said, “There’s a situation around the hotel, so I must keep an eye on it.”</p><p>The old man opened his eyes again frowned, “You said there’s a situation nearby the hotel? What is it?”</p><p>The petite woman said, “I observed the situation around with a telescope a dozen minutes ago and I spotted some suspicious people. There have been at least six people strolling aimlessly and doing nothing near the hotel these last ten minutes or so. They are like intelligence agents, monitoring all the people in and out of the hotel. Even one of them is hiding in a car, like their recording something.”</p><p>The old man in a black robe floated up and came to the window quickly. He then looked outside through the curtain slit. His eyes flickered and, and after he calmly observed for several minutes, he said indifferently, “Go and wake up Young Master. We’ll move immediately.”</p><p>“But what Young Master hates the most is having someone disturbing his sleep. Besides, the target of those people might not be us; should we wait a bit more?” asked the petite woman.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
