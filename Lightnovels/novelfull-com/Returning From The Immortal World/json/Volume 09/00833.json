The first one was to go to Kanas—to Longquan Bay to try to open the mysterious immortal abode. The second was to go to Israel to spend quite a fortune on buying manpower. From the looks of the current situation, however, going to Israel was more urgent than visiting Longquan Bay in Kanas.</p><p>Two days later.</p><p>Tang Xiu came to Hong Kong alone. After getting off the plane, he took a cab empty-handed. He had originally planned to go straight to his residence in Hong Kong, but changed his destination after some thinking. Instead, he headed to the Grand Fortune Jewelry Group. He had never been there before, even though he was the Big Boss of the company.</p><p>He had a lot of jades inside his interspatial ring, most of them being high-quality. Once these jades were processed, engraved, and made into a large number of products, he could make a fortune when they sold. If he could also use the connections of Grand Fortune Jewelry, he could earn more money and even buy more raw jades.</p><p>Central Hong Kong was located on the north shore of Hong Kong Island and acted as the central business district for commerce, finance, and banking. It was also the authority center of the government, making it the special administrative region. The price of the land there was sky high—even an inch of land might cost you gold. It could be said to be the most prosperous place in Hong Kong.</p><p>The Grand Fortune Jewelry Co. owned a 33-story high-rise building that covered a large area. The 1st through 13th floor were commercial areas with various stores, including luxury brands, restaurants, entertainment establishments, integral whole supermarkets, and other high-end consumer stores. The 14th through 33rd floors were used as the core areas of the Grand Fortune Jewelry Co.</p><p>Tang Xiu took the cab to the south gate of the building and paid the fare. He then strolled into the courtyard and entered the premises. After checking the signs inside, he took the elevator straight to the 14th floor.</p><p>“Welcome.”</p><p>Four welcoming ladies with excellent curves who wore cheongsams bowed in ceremony while wearing refreshing smiles on their beautiful faces.</p><p>Tang Xiu slightly nodded at their greetings and headed to the door in front. He then found that the high-end jewelry stores inside had unpleasant staff members, though the number of guests was quite high. He even saw a tour group under the guidance of a tour guide watching the gold and silver jewelry inside, as well as the jades, emeralds, jadeites.</p><p>“Hello, Sir. How may I be of service?” A female clerk in a black suit came up and asked.</p><p>“I’m just strolling around.” Tang Xiu shook his head and said, “Please go back to your work; don’t mind me.”</p><p>A disappointed look flashed in the female clerk’s eyes. Tang Xiu’s appearance was very handsome; just looking at him made her heart race. There was even more disappointment as Tang Xiu was also wearing famous brands. She thought that he was some kind of second-generation nouveau riche, maybe even third generation.</p><p>‘Can’t get him as a boyfriend!’ the salesgirl muttered inwardly and reluctantly left full of disappointment.</p><p>Unaware of the salesgirl’s thought, Tang Xiu strolled around the store in a relaxed and leisurely mood. The items sold here were so common in his eyes; after all, the most expensive one was just hundreds of thousands of yuan.</p><p>15th floor.</p><p>After arriving here, Tang Xiu found the items were priced higher. He even saw several platinum diamond rings priced at more than a million.</p><p>Then he came to the 16th and 17th floors and looked at the items there. The price was much higher, especially on the 17th floor, which only had a few items. Though there were little more than a dozen, they were priced at more than 10 million.</p><p>“Hello, Sir. The 18th floor is an area restricted to the VIPs of our Grand Fortune Jewelry. Are you one of our company’s VIPs?” Two burly men in a black suit stopped Tang Xiu at the elevator door, while the beautiful woman at the counter asked politely.</p><p>“No.” Tang Xiu shook his head.</p><p>“Are you perhaps a staff member of our Grand Fortune Jewelry?” asked the beauty once more.</p><p>Tang Xiu thought for a moment and said, “I think so.”</p><p>The beauty slightly smiled and said, “If you’re a staff member of our Grand Fortune Jewelry, you just need to swipe your work card upstairs.”</p><p>“But I don’t have one.” Tang Xiu shook his head with a wry smile.</p><p>The belle looked empty and immediately replied with a smile, “You’re joking, aren’t you, Sir? Every employee of our Grand Fortune Jewelry has a work card. You can’t get to the top floor without it.”</p><p>Tang Xiu was silent for a moment and then curiously asked, “Is the price of the jewelry on the 18th floor more expensive?”</p><p>“They are indeed more expensive,” answered the beauty.</p><p>A disdainful look flashed in her eyes during her speech. Even though she concealed it well, Tang Xiu’s sharp eyes could still catch it. However, he was too lazy to care about this beauty’s thoughts. He took out his mobile phone and dialed Hao Lei’s cellphone number.</p><p>‘I can’t get through?’</p><p>Tang Xiu was stunned. He immediately released his spiritual sense and found Hao Lei in the jade processing workshop on the 26th floor half a second later. At the moment, she was focusing on carving a fist-sized jade while her cell phone and two-palms-sized notebook were placed on the table.</p><p>“Can you please inform the person in charge here, Hao Lei, to come down?” asked Tang Xiu to the beauty. “Also, she should be on the 26th floor right now.”</p><p>The belle stared at Tang Xiu with an odd expression. The smile on her face receded greatly as she replied, “Have you made an appointment with our General Manager in advance, Sir?”</p><p>“No, I just arrived in Hong Kong and she didn’t know that I was coming,” Tang Xiu shook his head.</p><p>The pretty staff member was silent for a moment before she replied with an apologetic look, “I’m sorry Sir, you haven’t made an appointment with our General Manager, so I have no right to contact her. If you’d like to buy jewelry from our store, we have many good things that are highly valued in our store on this 17th floor as well.”</p><p>Tang Xiu wryly smiled at her response and walked to the side to sit on the chair there and then said, “Forget it. I’ll personally let her know! Just tend to your work and don’t mind me.”</p><p>The pretty staff member creased her brows and looked at Tang Xiu for a long time before shaking her head. She could recognize most of the scions of respectable families in Hong Kong, so she was sure that she had never seen Tang Xiu. Moreover, hearing that he had just arrived in Hong Kong, he shouldn’t be a native here.</p><p>‘There must be a problem with him. What he said before and now are kind of contradictory.’</p><p>The beauty turned her head to look at the two big men in black suits and gave a signal to them the moment Tang Xiu didn’t notice her.</p><p>Immediately, one of the big men strode to the front of Tang Xiu and made an ill-spoken remark, “Sir, you said you have the means to contact our General Manager, so we’ll give you 10 minutes. If there’s no news after 10 minutes, please leave this place.”</p><p>Tang Xiu lightly glanced at the big man in front of him and then decided to put good use of a certain technique to condense his voice to transmit his voice to Hao Lei on the 26th floor.</p><p>“It’s me. Come to the elevator on the 17th floor.”</p><p>On the 26th floor.</p><p>Hao Lei was sitting in front of the workbench and was concentrating on the jade in her had. Although she was the GM of Grand Fortune Jewelry, she was very interested in carving jade and usually came here for carving and sculpting whenever she had some free time.</p><p>“Who?”</p><p>She looked up and glanced around, but found that there were only some staff members busy with their work. None of them looked at nor spoke to her.</p><p>“That voice… feels kinda familiar…”</p><p>Hao Lei was sure that it was not some auditory hallucination she heard, but she also couldn’t remember whose voice it was.</p><p>“I’m Tang Xiu.”</p><p>Just as she was confused, the voice rang again in her ears.</p><p>In that instant, Hao Lei abruptly jumped up from the chair and her eyes lit up. She put down the jade and carving chisel almost without hesitation, then took off her overalls as fast as possible and proceeded to head out to the elevator at a jog.</p><p>She finally understood why she felt that the voice was somewhat familiar. It was the Big Boss’s voice! That made her aware of one more thing—her Big Boss had the ability of long-distance voice transmission.</p><p>At the entrance of the 17th-floor elevator.</p><p>A young man wore a smiling face as he followed a hot and voluptuous beautiful girl. When they arrived on the floor, the young man promptly handed out a VIP card and said, “We want to go to the 18th floor for shopping.”</p><p>The female staff behind the counter had an envious look flash in her eyes before she received the VIP card and walked out from behind the counter and said, “Please wait for a minute, respected customers. The elevator will arrive soon.”</p><p>The young man ignored the pretty staff member and just looked at the girl beside him and fawningly said, “I pestered my Mom for full two days before I got this VIP card, Little Hui. You can pick whatever good things you see and like on the 18th floor of this Grand Fortune Jewelry.”</p><p>The girl called Yang Hui was the only daughter of a certain powerful and wealthy man in Hong Kong. She was a goddess in the mind of that young man. Being born with a golden spoon in her mouth, she was spoiled since birth, with a mind that always looked towards above. Even though that young man’s background was not worse than hers, she only had a sliver of interest towards him.</p><p>“You said it, Qi Changxing. I’ve been wanting to buy that love-heart crystal, but it’s too expensive, so I keep hesitating. Now that you want to give it to me, don’t go back on your word.”</p><p>“Don’t worry! I’ll take out all of my savings to buy that love-heart crystal for you as long as you like it, Little Hui,” Qi Changxing nodded without hesitation.</p><p>Yang Hui curled her lips but was a bit disappointed inwardly. She didn’t know how much savings this guy had, but she knew well how much that love-heart crystal cost.</p><p>As they waited for the elevator, Yang Hui turned around and saw Tang Xiu who was sitting on the chair. She thought for a moment and then called out, “Hello, can you give me your chair?”</p><p>Tang Xiu looked and sized up Yang Hui, then lowered his head again.</p><p>When Qi Changxin saw Tang Xiu, he didn’t see Tang Xiu’s face clearly, so he didn’t recognize the devil who had once made his Qi Family lose 2 billion yuan. He wanted to show his manliness before his goddess and immediately came forward to kick Tang Xiu’s calf and said, “Hey, dude. Shouldn’t you at least act gentlemanly in front of a lady? Is it that troublesome for you to give up the chair?”</p><p>Tang Xiu looked up and apathetically replied, “Then what if I don’t wanna be a gentleman, huh?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
