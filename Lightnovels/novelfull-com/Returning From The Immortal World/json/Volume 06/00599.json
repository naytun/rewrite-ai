Just the top officials of various provinces could be said to have at least two members from the Zhao Family, whereas the second in command and in the third ring of authority could be twice the number. Therefore, the Zhao Family indeed possessed sufficient power.</p><p>Zhao Qingfeng was the second son of the current Head of the Zhao Family and was now serving as an official in an important department in the capital. After receiving a phone call from his father from home, he was simply paralyzed. Although he knew his precious son was bold and brave and loved to stir up troubles, never once did he ever dream that he would be audacious to the extent. He knew what kind of place the National Virus Research Institute was, an special institution of great importance to the country—equal to the weapons research base in the military.</p><p>On the national highway a few kilometers away from the Virus Research Institute, two Audis were heading fast in the direction of the said institute. In the rear seat of the second car, Zhao Qingfeng looked ashen and angry, as flames kept flashing in his eyes.</p><p>An uncut jade is indeed worthless.</p><p>He kept thinking that his weak attitude towards his son had virtually made him grow up into a time bomb. Granted that this incident could be settled with a determined price was paid, but he was not sure when his son would cause more troubles in the future.</p><p>Ring, ring, ring…</p><p>His mobile phone buzzed and Zhao Qingfeng quickly answered it. His expression changed greatly right after, as a burst of disbelief filled his eyes, He fired his gun? And aimed it at Wei Xiqing, the Director of the Virus Research Institute?</p><p>In a flash, a despairing feeling gushed out in his heart. He was perfectly aware of the consequences of shooting Wei Xiqing. It meant that there was no escape for his son; he was doomed this time.</p><p>“Heed my order. Seize the gun from Zhao Yundi’s hand and take him back at once!” Zhao Qingfeng sternly yelled after taking a deep breath.</p><p>“We have already left the Virus Research Institute, whereas Zhao Yundi went inside with Tang Xiu and Wei Xiqing. We can’t go inside, so we can only go back now,” came the reply from the voice on the phone.</p><p>“He’s what?”</p><p>Zhao Qingfeng was stumped for words, puzzled and bewildered by the other party’s report. Since his son shot Wei Xiqing, shouldn’t Wei Xiqing be dead or at least injured?</p><p>Just how…</p><p>A few minutes later, the riddle that plagued Zhao Qingfeng’s mind was finally solved. The savage beating his son suffered under Tang Xiu not only did not make him angry, but instead made him feel grateful and overjoyed inwardly.</p><p>He gave him a beating, thus saving others.</p><p>Tang Xiu slapped his son for what he had done and took the responsibility of what would be a terrible disaster—an action that Zhao Qingfeng couldn’t bear to feel grateful at.</p><p>With his special identity, an order was passed down to give him green light to enter the Virus Research Institute after going through inspection outside. As the cars drove all the way to the square outside the quarantine area, Zhao Qingfeng quickly and forcefully opened the car’s door and dashed toward Zhao Yundi. Though the latter’s face was already swollen and beet red due to Tang Xiu’s slaps, Zhao Qingfeng didn’t even have a shred of pity nor distress as he was more furious instead.</p><p>Pa pa pa…</p><p>After a dozens slaps, Zhao Qingfeng seemed to have vented all his bottled up anger and finally stopped. He pushed his son down, glared at him and threw a rain of curses, “If I knew earlier that I would give birth to such an asshole like you, I would have thrown you off from your mother’s womb before. You just made the Zhao Family completely lose face! How I wish to cover up this shame! You fucking idiot, do you have a swine or a sheep brain, huh?”</p><p>Stunned and perplexed, never did Zhao Yunde dreamed that his father would madly rush at him without wasting even a second after arriving here, more so that he yelled and cursed him. He was already quite angry inside after having his face crazily slapped by Tang Xiu, and now that his father also arrived only to slap him, it left him furious as he lost his mind, “What the hell did you hit me for? What makes you have the right? Is it because you’re my father and just because you think that I made the Zhao Family lose face? Have you asked me and thought of my original intention? For who do you think I did this? It’s for my sister, your daughter, your own biological daughter…”</p><p>Zhao Qingfeng clenched his fists. Though he felt a bit uncomfortable and distressed seeing the appearance of his son, he still hardened his heart and shouted to the several security guards who came running over, “Beat him! Beat him so hard the he won’t forget this lesson. I don’t think he realize his own mistake. HEY, WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU GAWKING FOR? BEAT HIM!”</p><p>The guards exchanged dismayed looks. After hearing the cold command from Zhao Qingfeng, they could only let out helpless expressions and send a series of punches toward Zhao Yundi. Of course, since they were all experts with good martial force, they didn’t hurt Zhao Yundi’s muscles and bones even though the fella was pained and hurt all over.</p><p>“Now, tell me, do you realize what your mistake is?” Asked Zhao Qingfeng in anger.</p><p>Zhao Yundi twisted his neck and shouted, “NO! I’m not wrong at all!”</p><p>Bam…</p><p>Zhao Qingfeng kicked him and shouted again, “Keep beating him! I’ll take the responsibility even if he dies. Keeping a scourge like him will only court big troubles and direct calamities to befall upon the Zhao Family sooner or later.”</p><p>What happened next was another series of powerful punches.</p><p>“How about now? Have you realized your mistake?” Asked Zhao Qingfeng in a heavy tone.</p><p>“NO!” Zhao Yundi yelled while gritting his teeth in pain.</p><p>“You have got guts, eh?” Zhao Qingfeng gave him a thumbs up and sighed. “Then you will taste my next move. Bring him back to the family home. I’ll first punish him under the punishment rules of the Zhao Family. Throw him into the dark room and lock him up there. Do you admit your mistake, now? If you don’t, then you’ll stay in the dark room until you die!”</p><p>With pupils violently shrinking, a fearful expression could be seen flashing in Zhao Yundi’s eyes. The dark room of the Zhao Family was constructed according to the secret detention room in the army, with space that was even smaller and narrower than the army’s solitary confinement room. He was locked up in that dark room when he was small numerous times, but the time he spent there was at most one day.</p><p>Certainly, he was also very desperate being punished like that in the past. That dark room, in his eyes, was absolutely not a place for anyone to stay in. He could barely hold on after staying there for a few hours, and a day almost blasted through his limit. He felt that he would definitely collapse and even possibly commit suicide after three to five days if he were to be locked up there.</p><p>“Don’t! I admit it… I admit my mistake. My actions were indeed reckless, that I admit, but it’s all for the sake of Sis since you don’t even care about her at all as her father. She’ll die here if I don’t take care of her.”</p><p>Inwardly, Zhao Qingfeng sighed. He was disappointed by this son of his. How could he possibly not care about his own daughter given his disposition, for God’s sake? As a matter of fact, he had already made a phone call to Wei Xiqing and also received words of guarantee from the latter that he would try everything he could to treat his daughter.</p><p>But now, this audacious, good-for-nothing son was such a nuisance. If it wasn’t for the presence of Wei Xiqing, he would probably have already dug a hole and burrowed himself inside due to shame and embarrassment. All fathers have great hopes for their sons, longing for them to succeed in life. But at this moment, he no longer had such wistful thoughts, but only wished that his own son would not become an insect.</p><p>Zhao Qingfeng then waved his hand at the security guards. His vision then shifted to Chen Tong nearby, and hesitated for a moment before asking, “Young man, you are…”</p><p>At this moment, Chen Tong was somewhat nervous. Since he knew that Zhao Yundi was Zhao Tingting’s biological brother, he wanted to get closer to him. But now he was more nervous because Zhao Qingfeng also came. There was even the feeling of ugly-looking daughters-in-law had when they saw their parents-in-law.</p><p>“Hello, uncle. I’m Chen Tong, and Tang Xiu is my Grand Master.”</p><p>This reply made Zhao Qingfeng’s face turn blank, as he never imagined that Tang Xiu would even have a grand-disciple. After hesitating for a moment, he curiously asked, “Then your father is…”</p><p>“My father is Chen Zhizhong, the owner of our family business, the Endless Virtue Pharmaceutical.” Chen Tong gave an honest answer.</p><p>Zhao Qingfeng suddenly understood, as he had also learned many things about Tang Xiu and naturally knew that the latter had several disciples, of which Chen Zhizhong of Endless Virtue Pharmaceutical was one of them. He nodded in response as he then carefully observed Chen Tong before asking again, “You came here… with Tang Xiu?”</p><p>“It was actually me who invited Grand Master,” said Chen Tong. “I… Your daughter and I are fellow students overseas, and…”</p><p>And?</p><p>Zhao Qingfeng stared blankly and looked surprised as he asked, “And what? What’s exactly between you and my daughter?”</p><p>Looking a bit awkward, Chen Tong still nodded and answered, “Uncle Zhao, I really like Zhao Tingting. And this time our return from abroad is because I’m preparing to visit you and auntie. I never expected that we would encounter this matter.”</p><p>In an instant, everything became clear to Zhao Qingfeng. No wonder his daughter said that she would give him a pleasant surprise before returning to the country. It turned out that she was going to bring her boyfriend home. He didn’t feel repugnant toward Chen Tong, and even felt satisfied and happy. Though the Zhao Family was prominent and had a lot of assets, the House of Chen was not bad either, as Chen Zhizhong’s Endless Virtues Pharmaceutical was a prominent leading pharmaceutical company in China. Furthermore, Chen Tong chose to stay with his daughter when peril befell her and even asked his Grand Master, Tang Xiu, to come to Beijing. This was enough evidence that he really cared about his daughter.</p><p>“If Tingting can safely survive this tribulation, I’ll tell her bring you to come visit our home!” Zhao Qingfeng patted Chen Tong’s shoulder and sighed after being silent for a short while.</p><p>Slightly stunned and surprised, a pleasantly surprised expression then plastered itself on Chen Tong’s face. As intelligent as he was, he could tell from Zhao Qingfeng’s words that his future father-in-law had already accepted him.</p><p>“Thank you, Uncle Zhao. I firmly believe that Tingting will be fine.”</p><p>Zhao Qingfeng nodded in response. He stayed waiting outside since, firstly, he came here to find out the specific circumstances his daughter was in, and secondly, he also had to apologize to Wei Xiqing and express his gratitude to Tang Xiu.</p><p>Two hours later, Tang Xiu came out of the door of the quarantine area along with the staff who accompanied him, whereas Wei Xiqing also hurriedly followed in nearly at the same time.</p><p>Apologizing and conveying words of gratitude, Zhao Qingfeng took the responsibility and displayed a very sincere attitude. After Wei Xiqing gave his forgiveness, he inquired, “Tang Xiu, how is my daughter now?”</p><p>“Don’t worry!” Tang Xiu smiled lightly. “She still needs to stay here for two days for further observation, but she can leave if no unexpected changes appear in her body in these two days.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
