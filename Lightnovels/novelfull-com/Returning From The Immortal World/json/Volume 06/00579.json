Even these six or seven policemen he brought were looking at him with bizarre expressions.</p><p>Pa…</p><p>Driven by anger, Feng Kang slapped the woman and yelled, “SHUT UP! Speak garbage again and I’ll arrest you under false accusation and slandering!”</p><p>The woman covered her cheek and bellowed, “GOD! A COP IS HITTING SOMEONE! His wife cheats on him and finally got on an accident here. I told him the truth yet he lashes out his anger out of shame? Where is the law? Everyone, tell me, which one is the right and which one is the wrong? Can a cop beat someone like this?”</p><p>After Feng Kang slapped her out of shame and anger, he immediately regretted it. In any case, he was the Deputy Chief of the City Public Bureau, and he must never hit someone in this kind of situation in public.</p><p>As expected, a commotion immediately exploded from the onlookers around. Each and every one of them revealed indignant expressions. Many even steppeding out to demand for Feng Kang to take responsibility due to his excessive action, whereas some people kept adding fuel to the flames in the back, causing the onlookers to turn angrier.</p><p>Tang Xiu was sitting in the car while watching the unfolding changes in front. He then looked at Chen Xiaowan and sighed, “That woman really is ruthless. She arranged all the links required to interlock with each other for the event. Yue Zigang and that fat woman are probably not the only ones to fall on hard times, even this Deputy Director of the Public Security Bureau will be implicated.”</p><p>“Is that policeman who beat that woman is the husband of that fat woman?” Asked Chen Xiaowan in a low voice.</p><p>“He should be, or else why would someone from the Public Security Bureau rush over to a traffic accident site and not the traffic policemen?” Tang Xiu chuckled. “That woman who revealed the fact that his wife is cheating on him was obviously arranged by someone else. For that policeman to actually hit someone with such a furious expression can only mean one thing—that he’s the unlucky man who got cuckolded by his wife.”</p><p>Chen Xiaowan nodded. She suddenly looked a bit awkward when she looked at Tang Xiu and said in a low voice, “Can you not say ‘cuckolded’ anymore? It kinda feels like the words are crowned over my head.”</p><p>Cough… cough…</p><p>Her words made Tang Xiu choke between laughter and tears. He then looked at her in the eyes, as he forced a smile and said, “It’s already in the past, Sis Xiaowan. You don’t need to brood over it. If the pet dog you liked so much were to bit you, you would just kick it away.”</p><p>A pet dog?</p><p>A faint smile appeared on Chen Xiaowan’s beautiful face after hearing it.</p><p>Standing next to the ambulance, Feng Kang was facing accusations from the numerous onlookers in the surrounding. He wanted to completely understand the truth of the matter as he grabbed the slapped woman’s hand and asked in a heavy voice, “I apologize for what I just did, but you are also being held responsible for what you spoke. How can you prove that they have a secret relationship?”</p><p>“How can I prove it? Do I even need to prove it?” The woman retorted angrily. “Dozens of people can be witnesses; they saw them in the Wanmao Shopping Center’s Carine Gilson lingerie store! If you don’t believe me, send your policemen to that store to investigate it.”</p><p>Feng Kang let the woman go as he turned around and shouted, “Li Hu, go to the Wanmao Shopping Center and investigate what she said. I’ll escort them to the hospital and wait for your news there.”</p><p>“Yes, Sir!”</p><p>The young policeman replied and left with two more of his comrades.</p><p>As the ambulance left, the accident crew rushed to tow away the flipped over SUV, and the onlookers slowly dispersed. Tang Xiu followed the ambulance to Shanghai Hospital. When he parked in the hospital’s parking lot, his face suddenly flickered as he spoke, “Sis Xiaowan, do you want to completely solve the Yue Zigang trouble?”</p><p>“Solve it?” Asked Chen Xiaowan, confused.</p><p>“Transfer 100 thousand yuan to his account now. He threatened you in the Carine Gilson store back then and many people can be witnesses for it. Supposing that it’s true, then he’s allegedly responsible for blackmailing and extortion. I have a way to make him rot in prison for 8 to 10 years because of this amount of money.”</p><p>Chen Xiaowan dumbfoundedly stared at Tang Xiu for a long time, before she shook her head bitterly and said, “Just forget it! He has already received the punishment he deserves. If he gets more… it’s kinda makes things way too difficult for him.”</p><p>Tang Xiu sighed inwardly and kind of regretted saying his idea to her. Chen Xiaowan sometimes showed a tough stance on the surface, but being kind hearted and tenderhearted was one of her major characteristics. In this regard, she was actually very much like his mother, Su Lingyun.</p><p>“Alright, let’s forget it since you don’t have the heart to do it. Let’s wait here, I’m sure soon some news will come.”</p><p>“All right!”</p><p>More than an hour later, Tang Xiu released his spiritual sense to monitor the situation and found that the police officers sent to the Wanmao Shopping Center had returned and reported to Feng Kang about the truth of the matter at the entrance to the operating room. Feng Kang was so furious that he kicked open the door of the operating room to beat Yue Zigang, who was about to be treated. About four doctors rushed to stop him, but couldn’t do anything. In the end, he unexpectedly grabbed a scalpel and hacked it over on Yue Zigang’s crotch.</p><p>He’s castrating him? Tang Xiu was stupefied.</p><p>Chen Xiaowan was distracted, thus she didn’t see the changes in Tang Xiu’s expression. Then, they got off the car as they walked toward the nearby building. There, many voices entered their ears:</p><p>“What a strange thing to happen! That policeman actually beat an injured person who was about to get a surgery. Unknown to all of what the true cause was, I heard a rumor that that policeman has even castrated that injured man.”</p><p>“Then, he turned into a eunuch?”</p><p>“Yeah, he has really turned into a eunuch. I heard it was terrible.”</p><p>\"...\"</p><p>Chen Xiaowan’s pace came to a halt as she turned to look at Tang Xiu.</p><p>Despite having learned about it with the observation of his spiritual sense, Tang Xiu couldn’t reveal this, so he deliberately showed a surprised expression and said in a low voice, “For real?”</p><p>After staying silent for a while, Chen Xiaowan suddenly grabbed Tang Xiu’s hand with a satisfied smile on her gorgeous face, saying, “I don’t want to listen to the following story nor do I want to have a look. Let’s just leave!”</p><p>“Alright, let’s go and have a meal!” Tang Xiu let out a faint smile.</p><p>They no longer stayed and left the hospital to head to the Everlasting Feast Hall. On the way there, Tang Xiu made a phone call to send someone to watch the situation in the hospital.</p><p>****</p><p>At the Everlasting Feast Hall.</p><p>Life was very great for Chi Nan recently. It was because Tang Xiu told her to gather a lot of precious medicinal herbs in advance, thus she could exchange it for a large number of cultivation resources from the Everlasting Feast Hall’s HQ in Jingmen Island. Therefore, she spent all the money she had in hand to purchase a lot of precious medicinal herbs within a month of time and became the first member to receive massive medicinal pills for cultivation. As a result, her cultivation rapidly progressed and was only a step away from breaking through the Foundation Establishment Stage.</p><p>Furthermore, the Jingmen Island’s Everlasting Feast Hall’s HQ also rewarded her with some medicine pills that made her even more happy. Her only regret was that she went broke.</p><p>Where do I get money from now?</p><p>Chi Nan pondered a bit before deciding to take part in the underground racing. It was a skill she excelled at, and she would use this strong point to make money and exchange it for cultivation resources.</p><p>“Umm?”</p><p>As she was lazily leaning on the window on the second floor, she suddenly caught sight of Tang Xiu at the entrance of the restaurant along with a beautiful woman at his side.</p><p>Boss’ affinity with women is truly heaven-defying.</p><p>The thought crossed her mind before she strode toward the office outside. In just one minute, she already appeared in front of Tang Xiu.</p><p>“Hi, Boss!”</p><p>“Chi Nan, give my big sis our VIP card,” replied Tang Xiu with a chuckle.</p><p>Staring blankly for a short moment, Chi Nan then immediately wore a smiling face and respectfully said, “Boss, the identity of this distinguished guest is…”</p><p>“Sis Xiaowan, follow Chi Nan to get your VIP card! I’ll order some dishes first and will be waiting for you to come back,” said Tang Xiu with a smile.</p><p>“Are you the owner of this Everlasting Feast Hall, Tang Xiu?” Asked Chi Nan, taken aback.</p><p>“Yeah,” said Tang Xiu smilingly.</p><p>Inwardly, Chen Xiaowan was a bit shocked. As an executive of a large foreign company, she had been to the Everlasting Feast Hall to dine and was naturally aware of the fact that the Everlasting Feast Hall was one of the most upscale restaurants in Shanghai. Even the most common dishes here would probably cost around 8000 yuan. She herself didn’t dare to dine here often despite having a good annual income. Most of the time she patronized the venue only because she was accompanying the top executives of her company.</p><p>She didn’t know how Tang Xiu could become the owner of the Everlasting Feast Hall, because this restaurant had been in Shanghai for many years already, while Tang Xiu should be just a junior high student at that time.</p><p>A few minutes later, after Chen Xiaowan had completed her VIP card processing with Chi Nan, she came to a nice located dining table on the first floor, and then took a seat across Tang Xiu. She then asked him some questions that confused her. Tang Xiu, however, was unwilling to speak out the reason, so he casually made up a reason and smoothly covered up the past events.</p><p>During the meal the two talked a lot, such as how the two passed their lives over the years. Of course, it was mainly Chen Xiaowan speaking about her experiences, whereas Tang Xiu acted as a good listener. The Japanese-investment enterprise where she worked at, however, made Tang Xiu slightly surprised, because he had heard about that Japanese investment company before.</p><p>“All right, let’s not talk about me all the time. It’s your turn to talk. Didn’t you say you started a business before the CET? What kind of business is it?” Chen Xiaowan asked with a smile.</p><p>“Sis Xiaowan, you should have heard of the Magnificent Tang Corporation, right?”</p><p>“Of course. This company is currently in the limelight and has infinite potential.” Chen Xiaowan nodded and smilingly said, “Also, the cosmetic products of this company is the favorite kind for women. A pity that the sales are limited. I spent two months of my salary to buy it once.”</p><p>Suddenly, the smile on her face froze, replaced by a disbelieving expression.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
