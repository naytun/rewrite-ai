They were quite surprised when Li Jing came to them slowly, with nothing in her hands just like when she left.</p><p>“What happened?” Asked Tang Xiu, confused.</p><p>Li Jing didn’t understand what her Boss meant, so she wasn’t certain the excuses she had to tell the other party would be useful. However, she had already packed the stuff in her office and was waiting for her Boss to come. In the case that the matter ended up unsatisfactorily, she was afraid that she could only be swept out and leave for home.</p><p>She felt somewhat sorry for Tang Xiu and Mu Wanying, for she thought that they were just victims who got implicated by her problems, so she said, “Mr. Tang, Ms. Mu, I apologize for keeping you waiting. It’s because something went wrong. My Boss is currently heading here and he’ll arrive soon, I believe. Would you two wait a bit longer?”</p><p>“What’s the problem?” Asked Mu Wanying. “What exactly happened?”</p><p>Li Jing was about to speak but hesitated.</p><p>After looking at her expression, Tang Xiu’s brows slightly furrowed and then asked, “What’s the name of your Big Boss?”</p><p>“Chen Bin,” said Li Jing and secretly breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p>Chen Bin?</p><p>After searching his memories, Tang Xiu couldn’t remember the name, and obviously, he hadn’t met nor was acquainted with him, thus this should probably be a internal problem of their company! As he thought up to there, he then looked at Mu Wanying and said, “It’s fine in any case, since we have nothing to do this morning. We’ll wait a bit longer then!”</p><p>“That’s right!” Mu Wanying came to buy a house, but as a matter of fact, she had an ‘ulterior motive’. That was, as long as she could be alone with Tang Xiu, whatever the place was the same.</p><p>Seeing that they expressed their willingness to wait, Li Jing immediately shot they a grateful look and personally served them tea.</p><p>Afterward, she went to wait for her Boss outside the door. Fang Qiang then strolled in in a leisurely manner with his left hand stuffed in his pocket. His eyes swept over Tang Xiu before landing on Mu Wanying’s face, as shock immediately painted his face. Despite having considerable power in this sales center, he didn’t dare to offend these clients, for he knew that people who could afford to buy such luxury villas were not your ordinary layman.</p><p>Nevertheless, he may not dare provoke Tang Xiu and Mu Wanying, but that was not so toward Li Jing. He felt that he could elevate his dignity and rank highly if he taught her in front of Mu Wanying. So, he raised his chin and said, “What are you doing, Li Jing? Don’t tell me you haven’t told the clients that the villa #9 has already been sold?”</p><p>\"I…\" Li Jing opened her mouth and her face turned pale.</p><p>“What’s with me, huh?” Fang Qiang raised his brows and reproached her, “Though villa #9 has been sold, aren’t there three others that have not yet sold out? If you feel that you don’t have the ability to serve the clients well then I’ll do it myself…”</p><p>Tang Xiu frowned. He looked at Li Jing and asked, “What’s happened here?”</p><p>Li Jing finally realized that she couldn’t hide it anymore as she toughened her resolve and said, “Mr. Tang, Ms. Mu, I’m really sorry. I originally presented you the villa #9, but after I brought you back and was about to draft the purchase agreement, he told me that someone had booked the villa and the other party would come over to pay the purchase agreement in the afternoon. Actually, the customer who pays first would get the villa according to the policy of our company. I also talked about this with him, but he pressure me with his manager’s identity. I’m really sorry. I’ve already thought of a way to work it out. Please wait for a while.”</p><p>Fang Qiang never dreamed that Li Jing would actually point the spearhead at him, more so that she bluntly disclosed it to the customer?</p><p>Anger surged up from his chest, as he glared at Li Jing and berated her, “What nonsense are you spitting out? Who is using the manager’s identity to pressure you, huh? Your work attitude surely is problematic, Li Jing! You’re not worthy to to be a staff at the sales center of Loran Villa Complex. You’re fired! Go back and pack your stuff, and then leave!”</p><p>“That’s really impressive, Manager Fang!”</p><p>A cold voice came from the front door of the sales center as several men and women followed a middle-aged man inside. It was the middle-aged man who just spoke.</p><p>The familiar voice made Fang Qiang’s complexion change. When he turned and saw Chen Bin, his heart suddenly thumped violently as he obsequiously smiled and said, “Boss, why didn’t you inform me in advance? I would have sent someone to welcome you outside…”</p><p>With a grim expression, Chen Bin hummed coldly and said, “Could I still see your unruliness if I had given you prior notice? Training an outstanding salesperson has never been easy for the company, and yet you only need a few words to fire her? With you doing it in front of the customer, is really so inspiring in and of itself, no?”</p><p>A chill ran down Fang Qiang’s heart. As he was about to speak, he actually found that his Boss didn’t even want to listen to him at all, but continued to walk toward the young man sitting on the couch instead.</p><p>“Are you Mr. Tang?” Asked Chen Bin respectfully as he arrived in front of Tang Xiu.</p><p>“Do you know me?” Asked Tang Xiu back, surprised.</p><p>“Hello, Mr. Tang, I’m Chen Bin, the chairman of the Hongtu Group. This is my business card.” Chen Bin quickly said. “You and this young lady have been wronged by us, but thankfully our saleswoman has already informed me of everything. You can rest assured, however, that our company has distinct rules and policies that whoever pays the house is the one who gets it. Nevertheless, I still want to apologize to you and this lady for the problem caused by the staff of our company management that has brought a great inconvenience to the two of you here, and I must make up for it.”</p><p>“Oh? How do you want to make up for this matter, exactly?” Asked Tang Xiu while letting out a faint smile as he got up to shake hands with Chen Bin, and the motioned Mu Wanying to change the seat to give a place for Chen Bin.</p><p>Chen Bin felt slightly flattered for being able to sit next to Tang Xiu and said, “Mr. Tang, regarding the problem caused by my company management staff, I will fire him at once and also inform the real estate developer circle. He will be blacklisted from all the major real estate developers in the future.”</p><p>“This is an internal affair of your company.” Tang Xiu neither approve nor disapprove it. “It has no relationship with us whatsoever.”</p><p>At the side, Fang Qiang’s face was tragic as he hastily cried out, “Boss, you can’t fire me! I have the right to dismiss employees as the sales manager here. Also, I didn’t offend these two clients either!”</p><p>Chen Bin suddenly turned his head and yelled angrily, “SHUT UP!”</p><p>Fang Qiang’s breath lagged and dared not speak again.</p><p>The expression on Chen Bin’s face was then replaced with a respectful expression as he said, “Mr. Tang, I decided to sell villa #9 to you for 1 yuan to make up for the wrongdoing my company has done to the two of you. You see…”</p><p>What?</p><p>Tang Xiu was struck dumb, whereas Mu Wanying’s expression was one of disbelief.</p><p>1 yuan? A mere coin to buy a villa that was valued at over 60 million yuan? What kind of joke was this?</p><p>At the side, Fang Qiang stared at Chen Bin with disbelief all over his face as he couldn’t believe what he heard. He could tell that the Big Boss was not ill, but why did he…</p><p>Li Jing was also shocked, because it never crossed her mind even in her dreams that her reporting a complaint on the phone would unexpectedly turn the situation into this.</p><p>“Is it because of Han Jintong?” Asked Tang Xiu after thinking for a moment.</p><p>“That’s part of the reason, indeed,” said Chen Bin quickly.</p><p>“And the other part?” Asked Tang Xiu again, frowning.</p><p>“Mr. Tang, the person urged me to not mention him.” Chen Bin hesitantly replied, “I’m sorry, but what you ask is hard for me to comply.”</p><p>“There’s a saying that no gains will be obtained without pains.” Tang Xiu replied, “We’re here to buy a villa, not to obtain something for free. If you don’t tell us about the whole story, do you think we can accept your villa so easily?”</p><p>After contemplating for a moment, Chen Bin finally spoke, albeit reluctantly, “All right! Since you must know, then I can only comply. It’s actually Brother Jin Xingkui. I was having a discussion with him when I received a call from the sales staff—Li Jing.”</p><p>Tang Xiu suddenly understood. He looked at Mu Wanying, nodded and said, “I see. Since it’s a kind intention from Jin Xingkui, let’s settle this like that, then! Anyways, you don’t have to stay here, though. You can resolve the affairs in your company while we will also tend to other things after we’re done with the purchase of the villa.”</p><p>“You two, please wait for two minutes.” Chen Bin quickly got up and said, “I’ll immediately send someone to finish the formalities.”</p><p>When everyone had left, Mu Wanying leaned on Tang Xiu, grabbed his arm, playfully smiled and said, “I suddenly have a feeling, sweetheart.”</p><p>“What feeling?” asked Tang Xiu while glancing at Mu Wanying’s hands pulling his arm.</p><p>“It’s like I’m a mistress who’s supported by a man, that is,” said Mu Wanying with a chuckle.</p><p>Cough! Cough…</p><p>Her answer made Tang Xiu cough twice and be at a loss whether to cry or laugh. “Don’t talk nonsense, will you? You’re a rich young woman yourself, do you even need others to support you? The incident today is nothing but only an unforeseen mishap.”</p><p>“Yeah, an unforeseen mishap, yet it saved me of more than 60 million yuan.” Mu Wanying laughed lightly. “Anyhow, you do have quite the capabilities, sweetheart!”</p><p>Tang Xiu only wryly smiled in response and shook his head. He was actually pondering as to why Jin Xingkui urged Chen Bin to sell the villa priced at over 60 million yuan for 1 yuan only—what exactly did he invest to earn his friendship for?</p><p>Ten minutes later, Li Jing brought the house purchase agreement to Tang Xiu and Mu Wanying. Her attitude toward them at the moment had drastically changed—either her respectful expression or prudent attention to them betrayed the intense nervousness inside her heart.</p><p>Quickly after, the agreement had been signed. Mu Wanying herself didn’t have a single dime on her, so Tang Xiu eventually handed Li Jing a coin and smilingly said, “Anyways, don’t look so cautious like that—we’re not some big tigers. That’s right, has the duty shift for staff changes in your company been done already?”</p><p>“Yeah, it’s been completed, and Fang Qiang has been fired.” Li Jing replied with a grateful expression. “And I… I got promoted to the sales manager position. Mr. Tang, Ms. Mu, thank you very much.”</p><p>“No need to be that polite.” Tang Xiu waved his hand. “If anything, you have a good professional ethics and your work quality is commendable. It’s just that Fang Qiang should not be a good person, else he wouldn’t have made things difficult for a woman like you.”</p><p>Upon hearing this, Li Jing was so touched that she almost broke in tears. Though she had indeed made some achievements by struggling with her own abilities after coming to this metropolis and was finally able to buy a small apartment through a mortgage, she lived alone, and there were no shoulders she could rest her head onto whenever she faced difficulties. The bitter experience she went through today had turned out to be the warmest thing she had ever gotten since coming to this city.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
