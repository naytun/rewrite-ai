It was because the first patient in this epidemic case was his daughter, and he personally sought medical professors from several large hospitals in Beijing and recommended them here to help. Just a few hours ago, he also called those professors and learned that they hadn’t had much progress and couldn’t do anything about this epidemic.</p><p>How… how could it be alright all of a sudden?</p><p>Though Wei Xiqing said he already forgave Zhao Yundi, he still couldn’t completely get over it himself. After seeing Zhao Qingfeng’s shocked expression, he commented without being salty nor light, “Mr. Tang is hailed as a miracle-working doctor in China, so he naturally has a Divine Doctor’s abilities as well. Nothing is difficult for him, as a touch of his hand is enough to easily make a disease disappear.”</p><p>A deep feeling of respect immediately appeared in Zhao Qingfeng’s heart. He heard that Tang Xiu’s medical expertise was outstanding and he witnessed it this time. The infectious disease the medical experts and professors were helpless about could be easily solved by Tang Xiu—the fact that his ability was a sky above theirs.</p><p>“Tang Xiu, I won’t say any grateful words for this grace, but feel free to call this Zhao Qingfeng if you ever need something within my area of capability.” Despite not easily giving anyone promises, Zhao Qingfeng pledged with all seriousness at this time.</p><p>“I have a doctor’s identity, thus it’s my duty and responsibility carry on my work. Besides, a grand-disciple of mine has a very close relationship with Miss Zhao. Since I have the ability, it’s only natural that I do my best.”</p><p>Looking at his son at the side, who was beyond recognition and overshadowed, Zhao Qingfeng felt bitterness inside. Tang Xiu was a few years younger than his good-for-nothing son, yet not only was he gifted and charming but also possessed a very strong capital to enterprise greatness, and was needless to say that he had skillful and powerful personal abilities as well. If the two were to be compared, Tang Xiu was akin to a golden dragon that soared above the clouds, whereas his son could only be regarded as mud in the pit.</p><p>They truly are worlds apart! Zhou Qingfeng sighed inside, and then said, “Tang Xiu, there are still things I need to tend to, so I won’t stay here any longer. Please do visit my house for a drink some other day.”</p><p>“I will visit Uncle Zhao if there’s time.” Tang Xiu nodded with a smile.</p><p>Zhao Qingfeng left and took away Zhao Yundi, who wore a complicated expression. Though the latter was miserably beaten by Tang Xiu, his sister was saved by him, after all. It was the kind of grace he would never be able to change.</p><p>Wei Xiqing looked back from the two leaving cars and turned to Tang Xiu with admiration, saying, “Divine Doctor Tang, I’ve already arranged everything. The medical experts and professors want to see you. What you did have gained their sincere admiration.”</p><p>“I won’t see them, since they should all be experts from Western medical science whereas I’m a Chinese one.” Tang Xiu shook his head. “The important meanings from the Chinese and Western in regards to this matter is like comparing an apple to an oyster. Anyways, Director Wei, my aunt has already asked me to tend to something else, so I’ll take my leave first.”</p><p>Wei Xiqing nodded before suddenly saying, “Divine Doctor Tang, can you let Chen Tong stay? He…”</p><p>Tang Xiu looked blank for a second before looking at Chen Tong.</p><p>After thinking for a moment, Chen Tong nodded and said, “Grand Master, I’ll stay here since Director Wei still isn’t relieved about me! However, I want to stay with Tingting.”</p><p>Having his thoughts laid bare caused Wei Xiqing to look awkward. He immediately spoke after hearing Chen Tong’s request, “No problem. Zhao Tingting is alone in her room. I’ll arrange for you to stay in the same room as her.”</p><p>Seeing that Chen Tong had already made the decision, Tang Xiu didn’t say anything more. After driving away from the Virus Research Institute on Chen Tong’s car, he headed straight to the Tang Family ancestral residence. What surprised him was that his grandfather, Tang Guosheng, who rarely went out, was actually out today, and even his grandmother didn’t know where his grandfather went.</p><p>Tang Xiu then accompanied his grandmother in his ancestral home. He then called Tang Wei and learned from him that he was having a discussion with his friends outside. Tang Xiu didn’t disturb him again but rather went out to stroll around as he wished.</p><p>He didn’t know that what happened today was rapidly spreading outside. Everyone, whether it was the elders of the prominent families or the silk pants community in Beijing, all were applauding him today.</p><p>Kande Club.</p><p>It was an upscale club of Beijing; even the scions of billionaires found it difficult to pass through its doors. The total number of its members was less than 200, with each one having significant power and influence.</p><p>Inside the outdoor swimming pool, the white mist of the hot water buzzed as two young men in swimsuits were surrounded by a group of beautiful bikini girls, drinking red wine, smoking cigars, and enjoying shoulder massages of the bikini girls.</p><p>“Tang Wei, please consider my proposal well. This business only needs a small capital, yet the profit is huge. It’s an opportunity that won’t come twice,” said Qin Shaoyang, who looked comfortable with squinted eyes.</p><p>Tang Wei’s expression was somewhat serious, and he didn’t seem to enjoy it much despite being surrounded by alluring young women. Qin Shaoyang wanted to pull him closer but putting it bluntly, he just wanted to use the resources of his family.</p><p>The Yao Family had collapsed, and the strength exposed by the Tang Family finally made all the families realize that even though the Tang Family had been in decline all these years, they didn’t know how really powerful they were. This family could be said to be the in the top five among the domestic prominent families.</p><p>Therefore, Tang Wei’s status among the scions’ circle in the capital was also elevated along with the rise of his family. In just this n half a month, there were more than ten scions who disguisedly showed him amiable faces and goodwill. These people merely wanted to exploit an opportunity with his presence, whereas those who couldn’t get close to him were all stretching their necks, waiting anxiously to make a move.</p><p>Like this Qin Shaoyang. This fella was already rich, and his family even more. His father had been in the real estate development business for more than 20 years. He earned himself a full pot of fortune with his strong business sense, acumen, and schemes. Added with the wealth of his family that also became a major stockholder in several large logistic businesses in the country, some people even calculated that the total assets of Qin Shaoyang’s family if not more than 50 billion, it was probably not far away from that number.</p><p>Unfortunately, the Qin Family only had a few members. Qin Shaoyang himself had an uncle, a black sheep, the prodigal son of the family who was always indulging himself in disgusting orgies, drinking, gambling, and frequenting brothels—a typical silk pants lifestyle. The most important of all was that he had not been married until now and had no fixed, serious girlfriends.</p><p>Qin Shaoyang was the youngest of two brothers. His big brother entered the Ministry of Public Security system on account of his father, who secretly removed the obstructions for him. Contrary to what one might expect, he was now prospering there, yet no one knew what his future held. Qin Shaoyang was very smart and also received an excellent education in the capital since childhood. He had made acquaintances with a group of scions and young masters in Beijing in his school fraternity, and only had a slight attitude of a typical silk pants. He imitated his father’s style when he entered society, creating personal connections by currying favor with those in authority for personal gains. He reached perfection in that aspect.</p><p>The reason he found Tang Wei this time was that he hoped that he could establish a connection with him and build a bridge to the Tang Family in extension. Therefore, he proposed a joint venture to set up an entertainment media company that integrated services such as an online literature section, game development, film and television production and their marketing, as well as a web broadcast platform and other types to be incorporated into a large entertainment media company.</p><p>The total investment was 4 billion yuan. According to his share proposal, Tang Wei would have 30% shares of the company by investing 200 million yuan, whereas he would hold 70% of the company’s shares with a 3.7 billion yuan investment. It could be said that this proposal was no different than giving money away.</p><p>“Contrary to one might expect, you are willing to sacrifice your hard-earned money, Shaoyang.” Tang Wei secretly heaved a sigh of relief as his serious expression disappeared and was replaced with a teasing smile.</p><p>“I have no other ways around it. Who made me want to hold on to your thigh in the first place,” said Qin Shaoyang while shrugging his shoulders.</p><p>Tang Wei couldn’t help but burst into laughter and then said, “You turn out to be this direct, eh?”</p><p>“Will you even look at me in the eyes if I acted artificial and hypocritical?” Replied Qin Shaoyang smilingly.</p><p>Showing a faint smile in response, Tang Wei then took the red wine glass handed over by the beautiful bikini girl beside him. After gulping it down, he then sighed, “If it stands to reason, your proposal is great and I shouldn’t refuse it. But my younger brother has talked to me, hoping that I would take part in politics and become a government official. Though I haven’t fully made up my mind yet, it’s almost a done deal! I’ll talk to my grandfather when I have considered it clearly. He should be very supportive and approve it.”</p><p>Taking part in politics and the government?</p><p>Qin Shaoyang stared blankly for a moment and immediately furrowed his brows.</p><p>He was aware of the law that politicians were forbidden from doing business in private. If Tang Wei was really to enter the political arena, his opportunity to hold onto his thigh was probably as good as gone already. There may be other members of the Tang Family, but Tang Wei was the only suitable one.</p><p>Tang Wei’s expression suddenly moved as a trace of a smile appeared on the corner of his mouth, “Shaoyang, that ‘Knight XV’ car seems to have arrived in your garage, right? I heard that this younger brother of mine likes cars so much that Auntie Tang Min recently gifted him another limited edition luxury sports car.”</p><p>His younger brother?</p><p>With a moved expression, Qin Shaoyang’s eyes suddenly lit up as if he had realized something. He then replied without a shred of hesitation, “If that brother of yours likes it, I’ll deliver it to him! But of course, he will definitely refuse it if I’m the one who’s giving it to him for free like this, though.”</p><p>Tang Wei was grinning ear to ear as he said, “Then, I thank you my brother’s behalf first. If anything, he just called me saying that he happened to be in the capital, too. Shall we go look for him?”</p><p>Qin Shaoyang immediately stood up and said with all seriousness, “Then I’d like to ask Brother Wei to recommend me. Tang Xiu… is simply my idol.”</p><p>“Ah, it seems that this younger brother of mine is very famous!” Commented Tang Wei smilingly.</p><p>“He’s more than famous.” Qin Shaoyang praised in a sigh, “His name is virtually like a roar of thunder that pierces one’s ears. Just based on what he did today, I’m afraid all the silk pants all over the country won’t even dare to speak up any words to challenge him.”</p><p>Tang Wei was taken aback. He slept until noon today and then received a phone call from Qin Shaoyang when he got up, thus driving here. He was simply oblivious to whatever happened today! After hesitating, he then asked with a confused expression, “What exactly did Tang Xiu do today?”</p><p>With a strange expression plastered his face, Qin Shaoyang replied, “Don’t you know that Tang Xiu just trashed Zhao Yundi today? It seems that Zhao Yundi turned into a pig’s head after getting beaten. After his father went there, not only did he not blame Tang Xiu, he even thanked him and took it as a debt of gratitude… Simply put, Zhao Qingfeng kind of regarded Tang Xiu as the life-saving benefactor of his son!”</p><p>Tang Wei gulped down, as he forced a smile and said, “Among all the young men under 30 all over the country, I’m afraid that only this brother of mine would dare to beat up that lunatic Zhao Yundi in such aboveboard and straightforward manner.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
