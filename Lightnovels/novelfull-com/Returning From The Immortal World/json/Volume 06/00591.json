The amount was simply too far away from her.</p><p>Before her eyes, however, her younger brother, who had been misunderstood by her back then even told her so openly that he would give her millions or even billions of yuan as pocket money... It scared her so much that her beautiful face almost lost color in fright and she almost choked to death by her own saliva.</p><p>Only after a very long while did she let out a charming smile and said, “Don’t speak carelessly like that, brother. Let alone speaking about so much money that I dare not to even think about it, even if you do give me such an amount of money, I don’t think I can even sleep out of worry. I don’t have the courage to accept it. If you nowhere else to spend your money, just do charity! There are many rich people nowadays, but there are even more poor.”</p><p>“I adopted a lot of street children and also helped the Star City Chinese Medical Hospital to set up a charitable fund. Notwithstanding the fact that the attempt is like a drop in the bucket, I will continue to exert myself on this in the future.”</p><p>“Great!” Chen Xiaowan nodded with contentment and couldn’t conceal the appreciation in her eyes.</p><p>During the time they were sipping and savoring the taste of their coffee while merrily chatting, a beautiful girl passed entered through the front door of the café. She was donning a black-colored martial arts training suit and was followed by two well-dressed females in black suits.</p><p>“Hi, Boss,” greeted Kuwako Yamamoto as she came before Tang Xiu and cupped her first while bowing. The two females behind her knelt on one knee, lowered their heads and didn’t speak.</p><p>Tang Xiu, whose back was against the front door of the café, turned his head after hearing Kuwako’s voice. When he saw the actions of the two women behind her, he immediately frowned and spoke in a deep voice, “Get up!”</p><p>The moment Kuwako spoke, Chen Xiaowan also looked toward her, and her beautiful eyes suddenly stared with wide eyes after clearly seeing Kuwako’s face. There was a disbelieving expression on her face as she abruptly jumped up from the sofa and looked restless.</p><p>Chen Xiaowan’s abnormal reaction was captured by Tang Xiu, as he felt somewhat strange inside. Yet, he still looked at Kuwako and said, “You too know that I never like people being too straitjacket in front of me. Restrain your subordinates and instruct them to change their kneeling attitude whenever they meet me.”</p><p>Kuwako was taken aback after hearing his words as a reverential expression was plastered her face. She quickly replied with a respectful expression, “Understood. This subordinate will teach them well.”</p><p>Tang Xiu nodded in response as he got up and pulled Chen Xiaowan to his side. After she sat down next to him, he pointed to the sofa in front, hinting for Kuwako to take the seat. This time, however, Kuwako acted smarter and immediately instructed her subordinates to sit on the next sofa.</p><p>“All right, speak now! You left Japan all of a sudden to give something to me. What exactly is it?”</p><p>While placing the suitcase she brought in front of Tang Xiu, Kuwako respectfully spoke, “This is something my men snatched from some explorers, Boss. That team of explorers hired a very capable mercenary group overseas and got an astonishing harvest. And this object is by far the most important item from the harvest. I felt that this object was a particularly remarkable, so I immediately rushed over to present it to you.”</p><p>Tang Xiu nodded in response and gently opened the suitcase.</p><p>“This is…”</p><p>Despite being strong mentally, Tang Xiu still couldn’t hold back a gasp after seeing the item inside the suitcase. He was a Supreme in the Immortal World and had once obtained countless precious objects, but even the most precious treasures in the Immortal World couldn’t make him so shocked.</p><p>The Chrono Crystal?</p><p>What was the object Tang Xiu most urgently needed right now? It was naturally the Chrono Crystal, for it was one of the treasures needed to cure his disciple, Gu Yan’er.</p><p>He thought that he would probably need to take a trip to one of the surrounding star fields once his strength was formidable enough. And he had to obtain this object whatever the cost, even if he had to go much more dangerous places. Who would have thought that the long-awaited Chrono Crystal was now in front of him? And the most unbelievable thing was that this Chrono Crystal was sent by Kuwako.</p><p>Suddenly, Tang Xiu raised his head, stared at Kuwako and asked with a sinking voice, “How and where did you get this object?”</p><p>“We got it in the Alps Mountain Range,” said Kuwako respectfully. “Two men among the mercenary group hired by that expedition party were elite talents groomed by my Yamamoto House. And fortunately, it happened that these two men sneaked back into the family a few months ago and met me. I controlled them and made them my trusted subordinates. Therefore, they reported the purpose of the expedition. This interested me enough to send them a lot of people to help, acquiring this harvest in the end.”</p><p>The Alps Mountain Range?</p><p>A firm expression appeared on Tang Xiu’s face as he decided to make a trip there. After all, to have a Chrono Crystal appear there meant that that place was extraordinary in and of itself.</p><p>At this time, his view toward Kuwako, which was originally only a chess piece to him, now changed, as he was truly grateful to her. He did rule her soul, yet the person herself followed him from the heart and even gave such an important treasure to him. This showed that she was very reliable and good, extraordinarily good.</p><p>Closing the suitcase, Tang Xiu took out two bottles of medicinal pills from his interspatial ring without being noticed by anyone. Then he said, “The things inside are your rewards. You did a very good job this time, making me very satisfied. This object may just be a crystal stone in the eyes of others, but it’s the best treasure in my eyes. As for you, stay for a few days more in Shanghai! And I’ll assign ten experts to follow and help you later.”</p><p>Ten experts?</p><p>Kuwako immediately got excited. Though she didn’t know what kind of reward was in those bottles, these ten experts were too important for her. She had witnessed those men and women under Tang Xiu, as each and every one of them possessed very formidable strength many people wouldn’t be able to contend with, including herself.</p><p>This time was precisely the moment of intense struggles and fights between the members of her family for power and authority. Despite having been imparted the Soul Ruling Spell from Tang Xiu and being able to control the life and death of others under this spell, yet she still felt that the number of true experts under her was far too few. With the help of those ten experts, she believed she would soon be able to clear up the situation in her House and became the leader of the new generation, as well as the first successor of the family patriarch.</p><p>“Thank you, Boss!” Kuwako Yamamoto thanked him—a gratitude that came from her heart.</p><p>Tang Xiu shook his head. He wanted to rush to Jingmen Island right away after obtaining the Chrono Crystal. However, Kuwako had just come to Shanghai, after all, and there was also Chen Xiaowan at his side, thus leaving now would be quite inappropriate. After weighing it further, he too felt that he didn’t need to be that anxious, for it was late already. It would be fine for him to wait until tomorrow before rushing to Jingmen Island.</p><p>After spending some time fiddling with the Chrono Crystal, Tang Xiu then stuffed it into his interspatial ring secretively. He then shifted his eyes toward the dumbfounded, tongue-tied Chen Xiaowan and said, “Sis Xiaowan, you started acting unnaturally since you saw Kuwako. What’s the matter?”</p><p>Chen Xiaowan didn’t even listen to the conversation between Tang Xiu and Kuwako Yamamoto. Her heart was fully submerged in stormy waves, because she had never expected that the subordinate mentioned by Tang Xiu before would actually be Kuwako Yamamoto.</p><p>At this time, she was as though just being awakened from a dream after feeling someone touch her arm. She abruptly stood up and asked, “Brother, wha… what is it?”</p><p>“Eh, what exactly happened to you, Sis Xiaowan?” Tang Xiu frowned. “You looked like you just saw a ghost when you saw Kuwako. Did you already know her before today, by chance?”</p><p>Kuwako looked at Chen Xiaowan’s face for a while, as she shook her head and said, “I never met this young lady before, Boss.”</p><p>Secretly, Chen Xiaowan gulped down. After a moment’s hesitation, she spoke in a low voice, “Brother, She… she’s the secret Big Boss of the Brisk Trading Group. I had seen her before at a company celebration.”</p><p>Tang Xiu was astounded and so was Kuwako Yamamoto as she suddenly spoke after pondering for a moment, “Ah, you’re talking about the Brisk Trading Group! I do have such a group company under the businesses I control. But I’m usually too busy, so I delegate most of my businesses to my subordinates to manage, and only pay attention to it occasionally.”</p><p>Again, Chen Xiaowan’s heartbeat accelerated and was even more shocked hearing the revelation of Kuwako’s identity. After all, the Brisk Trading Group was a large listed company! And yet it was only one of her numerous companies... What a huge wealth she had!</p><p>But… there was something wrong! She was Tang Xiu’s subordinate, and that meant…</p><p>Chen Xiaowan turned her head to look at Tang Xiu with a disbelieving expression plastered on her face.</p><p>The revelation that the company that Chen Xiaowan used to work at was actually one of the companies controlled by Kuwako was also unexpected for Tang Xiu. Recalling as how he accompanied her in her frenzied strolls all day long, and speaking about all the problems she met in that company, Tang Xiu suddenly felt that all that had happened was just an amusing game.</p><p>“Well, I’ll introduce you to her then, Kuwako. This is my foster Big Sis, Chen Xiaowan. She treated me very well when I was young—my family was very poor back then, so I always regarded her as my own blood sister. This morning, however, she was still an employee of the Brisk Trading Group, but was treated unjustly and got fired from the company. It’s a very interesting twist, don’t you think?” Explained Tang Xiu with a faint smile.</p><p>Whish… Kuwako suddenly got up from the sofa with a tense expression as she said, “Boss, the fault is on this subordinate, please punish me!”</p><p>“No, I didn’t have the intention to punish you.” Tang Xiu waved his hand. “I just feel that my Big Sis can’t be treated wrongly for nothing!”</p><p>Kuwako thought for a moment and racked her brains before she had an idea. She then said respectfully, “Boss, since your Big Sis Chen has been unjustly treated by the Brisk Trading Group, then I’ll definitely make the person who did that to her pay a heavy price. Please give me an opportunity to invite your Big Sis back to work for this company. Also, I’ll make her the CEO of the Brisk Trading Group in China, and it will later become her private property. What do you think about this?”</p><p>“I don’t think it would be necessary to give such a proposal to Sis Xiaowan given her disposition.” Tang Xiu waved his hand. “But making her assume the CEO position of the Brisk Trading Group is kind of a good idea, I think. What do you think, Sis Xiaowan?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
