After exchanging some greetings and pleasantries, he led Ouyang Lulu, Li Laoshan, and Wang Daoyuan to a remote table.</p><p>“Tang Xiu, why did you look tortured when you were exchanging pleasantries with others?” Asked Ouyang Lulu smilingly, as she came to Tang Xiu’s side.</p><p>“I really hate this kind of social exchange with no food for the mind. They may talk to us warmly now, but they tend to forget who you are after parting ways. Even if they do remember us, it’s because they encountered trouble or something like that. Their real objectives are definitely not as pure as you with your friends.”</p><p>“That’s right, that’s right! Brother Tang’s words have represented what I have in mind, too. When we both first met in Saipan, neither one of us knew who the other party really was, nor we knew each other’s name. It’s just that we felt that the other party was kind of interesting, and had something in common with each other.”</p><p>At the side, Wang Daoyuan’s expression flickered as he quickly asked, “Did you say that you and Brother Tang met in Saipan, Brother Li? In the past two months, I heard that there’s a huge project being undertaken there. Could it be…”</p><p>“That has nothing to do with me. I heard about it too, but my business hasn’t yet expanded abroad.” Li Laoshan waved his hand and smiled.</p><p>Wang Daoyuan nodded and looked pensive as he said, “After I heard of a huge project being undertaken over there, I sent some people to investigate. Unfortunately, I didn’t get much information from the investigation. I only heard that someone bought an island and is doing the reconstruction there. That’s really a pity! Such a big project yet it didn’t fall into my hands, or else I would probably be able to make a huge fortune.”</p><p>Looking stunned, Li Laoshan glanced at Tang Xiu with a strange expression, though he didn’t say anything.</p><p>Ouyang Lulu leaned closer after hearing it, and spoke in a voice only the two of them could hear, “Tang Xiu, what they are talking about must that island you bought, right?”</p><p>“It should be! But I don’t want this matter to be known by many people, so you mustn’t speak about it,” said Tang Xiu with a similar undertone voice.</p><p>“Got it,” said Ouyang Lulu with a faint smile.</p><p>The banquet organized by the Situ Family was very casual. As the Head of Situ Family—Situ Boyang, who was the host of the event, had finally arrived in person, and many of his old friends greeted him and dragged him to seat with them. The scene turned very lively as delicacies and good wine were then served.</p><p>Tang Xiu himself was quite reserved with his words. Even though nearly everyone who shared a table with him seemingly wanting to befriend him, yet he only responded with a simple reply to deal with them. The man who he paid attention to was Situ Boyang, the Head of the Situ Family.</p><p>“Tang Xiu, I’ll take you to grandpa to pay our respects!” Ouyang Lulu suddenly put down her chopsticks and smilingly said.</p><p>“All right, I’ll see him since he’s your elder! Besides, I also need to talk about something with the Head of Situ Family as well,” said Tang Xiu while smiling lightly.</p><p>There was an unusual expression on Ouyang Lulu’s face as she asked, “Do you want to see Grandpa? For what?”</p><p>“You’ll know about it after I meet him. Let’s go!” Replied Tang Xiu with a light smile.</p><p>As the two got up and came to the table where Situ Boyang sat, Ouyang Lulu grabbed Tang Xiu’s arm and smilingly said, “Grandpa, Tang Xiu and I came to give you a toast.”</p><p>Turning his head to look at Ouyang Lulu, Situ Boyang’s eyes immediately fell on Tang Xiu. After carefully observing him, he then nodded in satisfaction and said with a smile, “What a good young man. Tang Xiu, since you’re my granddaughter’s sweetheart, you will probably get closer with our Situ Family later.”</p><p>“I’m sure that we will be getting closer, Grandpa Situ. Anyhow, please accept this cup of wine as a token of my respect,” said Tang Xiu with a smile.</p><p>Situ Boyang raised his wine cup. After drinking it in one gulp, he smacked his mouth twice and sighed, “This Gods Nectar produced by your Magnificent Tang Corporation is simply exquisite. The flavor truly leaves a rich aftertaste. Tang Xiu, looking at Lulu’s face, can you open the back door for this old man and sell some of them for my personal use?”</p><p>“Ah, you’re joking. But if you really like it, I’ll tell Kang Xia after I go back to send you some boxes,” said Tang Xiu with a smile.</p><p>“Great! That’s great!” Said Situ Boyang with a loud voice as he laughed.</p><p>“Grandpa Situ, may I speak with you after the banquet is over?” Asked Tang Xiu.</p><p>Surprised and staring vacantly for a moment, Situ Boyang then immediately nodded and said with a smile, “All right! Just come with Lulu later, and let us have a family chat.”</p><p>“All right, then we won’t bother you anymore!”</p><p>Tang Xiu replied and then took Ouyang Lulu back to their table. Inwardly, he was silently considering and analyzing some variables about doing business with Situ Boyang. Prior to this, he wouldn’t have bothered to care about the Situ Family’s existence; yet, after today’s auction, he realized that he made a mistake. The Situ Family was part of the Occult Sect’s force and had very close ties with many figures from the said Sect in China. Many things that he could use would be available and easy to obtain as long as he searched them via the Situ Family.</p><p>For example, this auction. The Situ Family was able to put out two objects, the Qin Emperor’s Imperial Jade Seal and the Nine Phoenix Hairpin, which indicated how formidable and resourceful they were. Maybe sometime later the Situ Family would other good things again.</p><p>As the banquet concluded, Tang Xiu and Ouyang Lulu sent Li Laoshan and Wang Daoyuan out of the hotel. Following that, they then went to a luxury suite on the 28th floor of the hotel.</p><p>At this time, Situ Boyang was currently engaging in conversation with two old men. After seeing Tang Xiu and Ouyang Lulu’s arrival, he waved his hand at them and said, “Tang Xiu, you and Lulu are a couple, so you’re not an outsider. Wait for a while here, we’re discussing some important things. We’ll have chat after this.”</p><p>“All right!” Tang Xiu replied, yet he didn’t leave. Instead, he sat down with Ouyang Lulu on the sofa in the most back.</p><p>On the sofa in the center of the room, Situ Boyang put out the cigarette in his hand and slowly said, “We must find the map for that tomb; there’s only one left. As long as we find it, I’ll go and see to it personally. You guys must be ready and prepared as well since this will definitely a big deal for us.”</p><p>A thin old man, who was wearing a Chinese tunic suit, nodded and said, “Rest assured! We’re ready. It’s a pity that we haven’t been able to determine the precise location yet, though. Anyways, Brother Situ, is your body really fit to undertake such a dangerous task?”</p><p>“If you two old geezers can it, then why can’t I?” Said Situ Boyang proudly. “The three of us have found and explored over 100 tombs, and there has never been an occasion where we can’t judge their origin and what was buried inside them. We must never let this chance slip off our hands!”</p><p>“Yeah! It’s quite unfortunate that Old Mole Zuan has died, though. That codger was kinda selfish. Had he called the three of us, then maybe he wouldn’t have died. Although the Qin Emperor’s Imperial Jade Seal was robbed by him from that ancient tomb, I still want to see that flying sword he told us at his last breath,” said the thin old man with a sigh.</p><p>“Let’s wait for the news! Even if we don’t get the third map of the tomb, we can still trace the approximate direction. I’m sure that there must be a big secret in the Guzang mountain range,” said Situ Boyang slowly.</p><p>Not far away from them, Tang Xiu, who was currently listening to their conversation, had his heart move slightly.</p><p>A sword that could fly? Could it be a flying sword? A flying sword that could fly without being controlled by anyone should be a sword laid out within a sword array formation. And this array must also be quite powerful. What kind of powerful figure could have arranged it?</p><p>As Tang Xiu thought up to there, he immediately got up and walked to the front of three old men, saying, “I just heard that you spoke about the existence of a sword that can fly. I may know something about this.”</p><p>The two old men furrowed their brows. There was a displeased expression on their faces. As for Situ Boyang, though he also knitted his brows, he still replied with a smile, “Tang Xiu, since you you know about it, then tell us.”</p><p>“The sword that can fly should the flying sword of cultivators from legend. If you said that there’s a flying sword in the ancient tomb but there’s no living person in it, that means that someone has arranged a sword array with a flying sword there. Those who can arrange a sword array are definitely strong powerhouses among cultivators, and perhaps, the might of that sword array is not to be underestimated as well.”</p><p>“Sword array?” The three old men’s complexion changed and exclaimed at the same time. They didn’t expect that Tang Xiu would actually know about the existence of cultivators.</p><p>While pointing to the empty sofa at the side, Situ Boyang said, “Tang Xiu, since you know about cultivators, flying swords, and sword arrays, you should know more than that, right? All right, tell us!”</p><p>After Tang Xiu took a seat, he explained, “Cultivators are an existence veiled in mystery, possessing magical strength and terrifying abilities. Presumably, you all know that I bought the Qin Emperor’s Imperial Jade Seal at a very high price at the auction. But haven’t you thought as to why I bought it?”</p><p>After thinking for a while, Situ Boyang wore a serious expression and said, “Don’t keep us guessing, Tang Xiu. Go straight to the point.”</p><p>“Actually, the Qin Emperor’s Imperial Jade Seal is a magical device, and a very powerful device at that. I can’t tell you about its practical and specific uses, I’m afraid. But what I can say is that I know a lot about magical devices and cultivators. I can even tell you that I have the means to break that sword array.”</p><p>Situ Boyang and the other two geezers had their complexion greatly changed. Shock could be seen on their faces, as they stared fixedly at Tang Xiu and didn’t speak for a very long time.</p><p>Finally, Situ Boyang asked in a deep tone, “Tang Xiu, did you just tell us that the Qin Emperor’s Imperial Jade Seal is a magical device and you that can break that sword array?”</p><p>“That’s right!” Tang Xiu nodded.</p><p>“If so, are you a cultivator yourself?” Asked Situ Boyang quickly.</p><p>Shaking his head, Tang Xiu answered, “No, I’m not. But even though I’m not a cultivator, I know a lot about their situation. Of course, you can also regard me as a cultivator as well, since some of my abilities are comparable to them.”</p><p>“What exactly are your abilities?” Asked the thin old man hurriedly.</p><p>“For instance, I have a deep knowledge in arrays, as well as am adept in manufacturing magic symbols and talismans,” said Tang Xiu with a faint smile.</p><p>Arrays, magic symbols, and talismans?</p><p>The three people stared at Tang Xiu and were not able to speak anything.</p><p>They knew that Tang Xiu had another identity as a divine doctor, yet they never expected that he would also excel in arrays, as well as being adept in manufacturing magic symbols and talismans.</p><p>“From where and how did you learn about them, Tang Xiu?” Asked Situ Boyang.</p><p>“I always loved reading all kinds of books. Due to chancing upon some luck, I got a few books back then. The book contained knowledge about medicine, arrays, and magic symbols. And after many years of study and research, I eventually got proficient in them.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
