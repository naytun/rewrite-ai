She suddenly felt like she was dreaming. Prior to this, she thought that meeting Tang Xiu again would be an impossibility in this lifetime, thus it was unexpected that some dark hands pulled the strings, creating such a rendezvous for both of them.</p><p>In the past, Tang Xiu’s life was very bitter. She liked him because he was sensible and adorable, hence she treated him like her younger brother. It was very unexpected that he had already turned over the sky and earth in just four-plus years since the last time she saw him. The Magnificent Tang Corporation was akin to a dark horse with unstoppable momentum in the business world nowadays.</p><p>“Are you not lying to me, Tang Xiu?” Asked Chen Xiaowan with a trembling voice.</p><p>Shrugging his shoulders, Tang Xiu lightly smiled and said, “Do you think I’m the kind of person who loves bragging, Sis Xiaowan?”</p><p>With a hesitant look, Chen Xiaowan shook her head and said, “No, you’re not. But… but it’s too shocking. How did you achieve it?”</p><p>“I just seriously put my mind to it,” said Tang Xiu with a chuckle.</p><p>Chen Xiaowan snappily rolled her eyes and said with an annoyed expression, “I originally thought that I was very successful, since not only was I able to go to Shanghai, graduated from my university, entered a foreign-investment company and was able to climb up the ladder to the upper management, earning myself a good income and a very comfortable life. But comparing those achievements of mine with yours is simply ridiculous!”</p><p>Tang Xiu couldn’t help laughing, “Then just don’t compare. To think yourself successful is alright in and of itself. Just like those children who were born with a golden spoon in their mouths, as they already possess hundreds of millions of fortunes the split second they were born on Earth.”</p><p>Chen Xiaowan felt relieved and smilingly said, “What you said is reasonable indeed, but I’m still really shocked by your achievements. Anyways, let the meal today be on me, okay? You can treat me back some other day.”</p><p>Tang Xiu forced a smile and said, “Do you think you can treat me today, Sis Xiaowan?”</p><p>“Huh?” Chen Xiaowan stared blankly, before recalling that the owner of this Everlasting Feast Hall was Tang Xiu himself. Even if she were to rush to pay the bill, the cashier would probably not dare to accept her money at all!</p><p>“Fine then! The meal will be on you today, and I’ll treat you back some other day.” Chen Xiaowan showed a defeated expression. She didn’t have other ideas at all because of Tang Xiu’s identity, because Tang Xiu was still the intelligent and adorable little brother who called her ‘big sis’ in her eyes, even though the boy himself had already grown up now.</p><p>“Anyhow, you said that you’re working in a Japanese Company, Sis Xiaowan. What’s the name of the company and its business?”</p><p>“It’s the Brisk Trading Group, a retail company,” said Chen Xiaowan smilingly.</p><p>After noting the company name in his memory, Tang Xiu then accompanied Chen Xiaowan, finished their dinner, and personally drove her back to her residence in the Bishan Lake Sub-District of Shanghai’s Jingning County. Chen Xiaowan originally wanted to invite Tang Xiu upstairs, but Tang Xiu found an excuse to refuse it. Right after he drove away from Bishan Lake Sub-District, he received a call from a member of the Everlasting Feast Hall, who informed him what happened in Shanghai Hospital.</p><p>“You’re saying that… Feng Kang is being suspended and investigated by the Public Security Bureau?” Asked Tang Xiu through the Bluetooth earphone.</p><p>“That’s right. What he did was too excessive and seriously affected the reputation of the Public Security system as a whole. Hence, he was suspended by the higher-ups and a team from the Internal Affairs has already started investigated him.” A low and deep voice replied.</p><p>“I see!”</p><p>Tang Xiu hung up the call with a wry smile on his face. Speaking about it, this Feng Kang could be considered a true man with misfortune and bad luck. He had firmly secured a high position in the Public Security Bureau—someone with real power, yet his fat and ugly wife went out of track to cheat him behind his back. Him being cheated was needless to say, but he unexpectedly lost his sanity out of anger, leading him to castrate Yue Zigang in the hospital’s operating room.</p><p>After giving it a thought for a while, Tang Xiu then called his grandfather.</p><p>“Haha, how come you remember to call me, Xiu’er? Your Third Grandpa and I were just talking about you.” Tang Guosheng’s hearty laughter came out from the phone.</p><p>“You’re in a great mood now that our family has passed through the crisis and the Yao Family have fallen aren’t you, Grandpa?” Replied Tang Xiu with a chuckle.</p><p>“Yeah, I indeed feel great!” Said Tang Guosheng with a chuckle.</p><p>“Since you’re in a good mood, then can I ask you a favor? I want to protect someone,” said Tang Xiu.</p><p>“You want to protect someone?” Tang Guosheng was surprised. “Who is the person and what’s his identity?”</p><p>Tang Xiu explained about Feng Kang’s affairs and finally said, “Grandpa, there’s some things I wanna do in Shanghai and having someone in the Public Security Bureau would help to deal with things very conveniently later. Feng Kang is now currently facing an imminent disaster, so helping him at this time will make it easier to recruit him and secure his usefulness later.”</p><p>Tang Guosheng pondered for a moment and then said, “No problem, I’ll use my contacts immediately. All his troubles will be solved tomorrow afternoon at the latest.”</p><p>“There’s no hurry. It’s best to wait for two days!” Said Tang Xiu.</p><p>Tang Guosheng immediately understood Tang Xiu’s meaning. As of now, Feng Kang was in a moment of crisis, thus he wouldn’t feel very grateful if they immediately helped him. If they came to help when he was at the end of the rope and was suffering from  mental torture, however, he would definitely feel very grateful and would be of great use to his grandson.</p><p>“I see. Let him enjoy it for two days, then.”</p><p>****</p><p>Shanghai, Kangqiao Villa Complex.</p><p>Today, Ni Jie was in a very good mood. Thought she got slapped by a madwoman when she went shopping, what she did had vented out all the vexed and bottled up anger inside her.</p><p>“What are you giggling about, daughter?”</p><p>Ni Penggang, who was sitting on the sofa in the living room and was about to begin reading a financial magazine, suddenly saw his daughter came home while giggling, as he immediately asked her with a smile.</p><p>With a smiling face, Ni Jie replied, “It’s nothing, Dad. I just feel very good after tidying up a crazy dog today. Anyways, Dad, have you heard about Feng Kang—the Deputy Chief of the City Public Security Bureau?”</p><p>Ni Penggang was stunned for a second before nodding, “I know him. He’s a very promising Deputy Chief. I heard that he’s someone under the Old Man Wei, and maybe he will be able to hold up the office.”</p><p>“He will never be able to obtain the tenure, since I just pulled him down today after employing some schemes.” Ni Jie laughed. “I just got the news that he has been suspended and is currently being investigated.”</p><p>“How so? What’s going on?” asked Ni Penggang in surprise as he suddenly straightened up.</p><p>Ni Jie then told him the whole thing that happened today, finally saying, “If he wants to blame someone, he can blame his shameless, arrogant, and unscrupulous wife who acted as if nobody on Earth could beat her. Just take a look at my face, the palm print on it has yet to completely vanish.”</p><p>With a deep frown, Ni Penggang nodded and said, “Now that you have them tidied up, then so be it! it’s just a pity that Old Man Wei’s plan will be affected, though.”</p><p>“Dad, Uncle Wei’s matters are beyond my control. But you yourself have taught me to not provoke others if they don’t act untoward to me, and to pay them back ten times more if they do.” Ni Jie happily said. “Feng Kang’s wife slapped me, thus I had pay the favor back. But that woman called Chen Xiaowan is very good and I like her very much.”</p><p>“Since you said that she’s not bad, then pick her to be your aide to help you manage the business. I hope she has the ability.” Ni Penggang laughed.</p><p>“Will do!” Replied Ni Jie with a laugh.</p><p>****</p><p>Bluestar Villa Complex.</p><p>After Tang Xiu came back, he learned that Dai Xinye had actually come, making Tang Xiu pleasantly surprised. They had agreed that she would come to Shanghai after the National Day holiday, though she eventually postponed it for a month due to something happening in her family.</p><p>“Has the matter in your family been solved?” Asked Tang Xiu to Dai Xinyue, who acted conscientiously with Kang Xiu next to her.</p><p>“Yeah, everything’s been solved.” Dai Xinyue smiled.</p><p>“Pick a room you like on the first floor for you to stay! Also, I often have things to tend to, so you can read and study by yourself when I’m away. I’ll teach you whenever I have time to do so. You can expect to have your medical expertise progress rapidly by the New Year, and then I’ll take you to a hospital for an internship to practice giving medical services.”</p><p>With eyes lit up, Dai Xinyue respectfully said, “I’ll listen to all your arrangements, Master.”</p><p>Tang Xiu then turned his head to look at Kang Xia and said, “Have you had dinner? What are your plans for tonight?”</p><p>“I already had a dinner. Also, I have a promise with Xinyue to go out shopping! Though she came to Shanghai before, she didn’t have time to stroll here.”</p><p>“All right, off you go then! I will go out too later, and I’m afraid I’ll be back quite late,” said Tang Xiu.</p><p>“Where are you going?” Asked Kang Xia.</p><p>“There’s an old acquaintance from Hong Kong delivering some goods that I need to check. And I also need to see them to discuss something,” answered Tang Xiu.</p><p>“Tend to your matter, then! We’ll go out after you.” Kang Xia nodded after hearing it.</p><p>Tang Xiu went to the study room on the second floor and subconsciously moved to release the subdued fierce beast to feed it. Just when he came to the corner and realized that the array had been lifted, he suddenly remembered that he had already left that fierce beast in the Resting Cemetery Island several days ago.</p><p>“I really am too busy!”</p><p>Tang Xiu then took a bath and returned to the study room to begin drawing the design blueprint for Clam Island and Resting Cemetery Island; the area for the herb plantation in Clam Island, in particular. After all, each medicinal herb had different properties and the plan by which to plant any medicinal herb must properly be taken into consideration in advance.</p><p>The blueprint drawing for Clam Island was not even half-finished when Tang Xiu received a call. He was informed that the medicinal herbs sent by Li Juren had been brought at express speed and now was heading to the Everlasting Feast Hall. He was also full of expectations for the medicinal herbs sent by Li Juren.</p><p>After returning to the Everlasting Feast Hall again, Tang Xiu was just conversing with Chi Nan when a container truck arrived at the Everlasting Feast Hall under the escort of four SUVs. The five vehicles then entered the Everlasting Feast Hall’s backyard under the guidance of its staff.</p><p>“Hello, Mr. Tang. My Boss ordered me to deliver you these medicinal herbs; all of them are inside the truck. This is the list, please have a look at it,” said an elegant and refined middle-aged man who recognized Tang Xiu at first sight.</p><p>Tang Xiu took the list from him and a smile appeared on his handsome face after reading it, as he then said, “You can leave the container truck here. Find yourself a hotel to stay at, and then come early tomorrow to pick it up.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
