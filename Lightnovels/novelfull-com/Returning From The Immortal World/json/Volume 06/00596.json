Though her father didn’t speak what the matter was, she could guess a bit, as it should be related to the prominent families in Beijing that began to divide up the Yao Family’s assets and started to compete for the positions left by the members of the Yao Family.</p><p>At this time, the Tang Family was the one in the lead as the one who destroyed the Yao Family and was bound to get the most out of the cake. Tang Min, however, never expected that her nephew, Tang Xiu, not only came to the capital but also went to the Virus Research Institute. She knew the head of the Institute—Director Wei Xiqing, as she was the one who lent a hand to him when the man was suppressed by others, or else it would impossible for him to become the Virus Research Institute’s Director.</p><p>“No problem, I’ll call the Virus Research Institute’s Director—Wei Xiqing immediately. But Xiu’er, when did you come to the capital and why did you go to the Virus Research Institute in the first place? You know that there has been a very contagious virus outbreak recently. You… you didn’t come for that matter, did you?” Tang Min hadn’t taken it seriously at first, but the more they talked, she more she realized that it was related to the epidemic case.</p><p>“Auntie, I indeed came for the epidemic this time,” said Tang Xiu. “I’ll talk to you in detail when we meet later, since I’m kind of occupied right now.”</p><p>“Xiu’er, Auntie knows that you are titled as a miracle-working doctor, but you must not take this issue lightly! This virus case is no joke; there’s a possibility that if you are slightly careless… pah pah pah… now I’m talking rubbish! Xiu’er, let’s talk about it, just ignore that matter and leave it to others. Now that our family is having a big harvest, I’m sure we can get small advantages if you come to lend a hand,” hurriedly said Tang Min.</p><p>“What are these small advantages, exactly?” Asked Tang Xiu in an unusual tone.</p><p>“The Yao Family is currently withdrawing from the capital,” said Tang Min. “Many prominent families are secretly taking over the assets that used to be the Yao Family’s property, and the empty seats left by their members are also being targeted and fought over by them.”</p><p>Tang Xiu suddenly understood and said with a smile, “Auntie, with you dealing with those matters is fine to me. I can only lend a hand if it’s related to combat and killing, as I don’t understand politics at all.”</p><p>Upon hearing the meaning in Tang Xiu’s answer, Tang Min hesitantly asked, “Will you really not change your mind, Xiu’er?”</p><p>“I won’t and can’t change my mind. There’s someone among the infected that I need to help,” answered Tang Xiu.</p><p>“Who is that person?” Asked Tang Min quickly.</p><p>“It’s a friend of my grand-disciple, I guess she should be his girlfriend,” said Tang Xiu with a chuckle. “It’s my first time meeting this grand-disciple of mine and the first time he asked for help. So, Auntie, please contact Director Wei as I can’t delay for too long.”</p><p>“Alright then, wait for the news!” Tang Min immediately hung up after saying that.</p><p>****</p><p>Zhao Yundi had been secretly eavesdropping on the conversation when Tang Xiu called his aunt. He was a bit disappointed at first, but then was secretly startled after hearing that Tang Xiu’s aunt could contact Director Wei. After all, the Director seat of the National Virus Research Institute was a very special position, and government officials with insufficient power and authority would were simply impossible to get access to the person. Only those from some departments that held true control in the country may be able to contact Wei Xiqing. His Zhao Family could also directly contact Wei Xiqing, but he couldn’t wait anymore for fear that his sister would meet her demise in this damned Virus Research Institute!</p><p>“What’s your name, buddy?” Zhang Yundi raised his chin and asked after seeing Tang Xiu walking back.</p><p>“Tang Xiu!” Answered Tang Xiu with a smile.</p><p>“What’s the job of your aunt? Is her authority big enough?” Zhang Yundi nodded. “If not, let’s just work together and break through inside! If worst comes to worst… I’ll take you as a brother of mine later.”</p><p>“Hahaha.” Tang Xiu couldn’t help laughing. “I’d have already entered inside if I wanted to. They won’t be able to stop me relying on these incapable soldiers.”</p><p>Zhao Yundi rolled his eyes in response. If it was someone else who boasted about himself, he would have already slapped the man, but he wanted to pull Tang Xiu to his side now, so he suppressed the contempt inside and said, “Dude, real men need not boast. You gotta do what you gotta do if you got the balls. So let’s just rush in!”</p><p>Ignoring Zhang Yundi’s aggressive approach to goad him, Tang Xiu was instead looking at Zhang Lei, whose face was cold, and asked lightly, “How long does it take from Director Wei’s office to this place?</p><p>Zhang Lei didn’t want to answer Tang Xiu’s question, but he could sense something different from his words. While keeping the mind of wanting to see what joke Tang Xiu would unfold, he replied without being salty, “It takes twelve minutes running on foot, and four and a half minutes by car to get to the office building.”</p><p>Tang Xiu nodded and then looked at Zhao Yundi, saying, “Gimme five minutes. If the Director of the Virus Research Institute doesn’t appear in front of us within five minutes, I’ll cooperate with you to rush inside. What do you think?”</p><p>Zhang Lei was stunned. Though he didn’t believe it inside, he still endured and nodded.</p><p>At this time, inside the Director’s Office of the Virus Research Institute, Wei Xiqing had just called the Head of the Zhao Family to inform him that Zhao Yundi had come over to create trouble. After getting an apology from the Zhao Family’s Head and his assurance, the tense feeling inside his heart eased down.</p><p>However, before he even had the time to heave a relieved sigh, his mobile phone buzzed.</p><p>“Oh? This number is…”</p><p>After seemingly recalling something, Wei Xiqing immediately received the call and spoke, “Minister Tang, is there anything you need from me?”</p><p>“Director Wei, there’s something I need to trouble you with. My nephew, Tang Xiu, is now outside of your Virus Research Institute. He’s a Chinese Medical doctor at the Star City Chinese Medical Hospital and is also hailed as a young divine doctor of the new generation. I hope you can allow him to enter the site to help diagnose the patients and their disease. Maybe he can find out about the virus given his ability and help find the solution to the situation.”</p><p>Upon hearing Tang Xiu’s name mentioned once again, Wei Xiqing’s complexion suddenly changed drastically. He just felt that the name was familiar, but little did he expect this Tang Xiu was the Tang Xiu of the Tang Family. He had learned a lot about the situation the Yao Family was in at present, and the one who had the most credit for that was Tang Xiu through his actions!</p><p>Furthermore, Tang Xiu was also hailed as the young miracle-working doctor at the Star City Chinese Medical Hospital, a fact he couldn’t remember a moment ago. He nodded repeatedly a moment after and said, “Minister Tang, you can rest assured that I’ll personally rush over to invite Mr. Tang in.”</p><p>\"Thank you!\" Said Tang Min.</p><p>After hanging up the phone, Wei Xiqing didn’t even take time to take his coat. He only grabbed his mobile phone and dashed toward the outside. He could achieve his current status as the Director of the National Virus Research Institute, on the one hand, was because his academic achievements, and on the other hand, it was because of Tang Min.</p><p>His wife was Tang Min’s junior in high school, and it was her who asked Tang Min’s help when he was being suppressed by certain powerful government officials, thus helping him through that tribulation. Therefore, Tang Min was his benefactor, not to mention that her authority was much higher than his.</p><p>At the outermost blockade line within the periphery of the Virus Research Institute, Zhao Yundi looked at his watch. It had been four minutes from the five minutes Tang Xiu mentioned to him, and yet he neither saw a ghost nor shadow until now, making his contempt rise inwardly.</p><p>“Dude, the time is almost up. There’s only a minute left. I gotta tell you to move fast and don’t die for we’ll rush when the time’s up! Finally, we’re in this together no matter what the results are, capiche?”</p><p>“People say that haste makes waste,” said Tang Xiu coolly. “The time isn’t up yet. I’ll definitely rush inside with you if Director Wei hasn’t come out by then.”</p><p>“You wanna keep going while some hope is left, huh?” Zhao Yundi hummed coldly. “Since you want to wait, then I really wanna see whether that surname Wei is…”</p><p>His words came to an abrupt halt midway as a bright SUV suddenly appeared and then stopped in front of everyone ten seconds after. Wei Xiqing then hurriedly jumped out from the driver’s seat and glanced at the two groups of people confronting each other, before his eyes eventually fell on Tang Xiu.</p><p>He remembered Tang Xiu’s face, the one hailed as the most ruthless and difficult to deal with character in this generation of the Tang Family. Furthermore, rumors had it that he had just been found by the Tang Family after having been lost and lived outside for two decades.</p><p>“I’m really sorry, Mr. Tang. I didn’t know it was you before, so I made an offense. I hope you won’t bother with my ignorance.” Despite having a prominent identity himself, Wei Xiqing acted humbly at this moment with a full apologetic expression painted on his face.</p><p>“Let us not stand on ceremony, Director Wei.” Tang Xiu let out a faint smile. “The reason I came over is that I heard about the contagious disease and I hope that I can be of some help.”</p><p>“You’re a young divine doctor, and I’ve already heard about your integrity and medical expertise as well,” said Wei Xiqing quickly. “All the experts at our institute are quite anxious at present as they are still unable to study the virus and where it originate from. But I believe that we’ll definitely be able to save many people with your help.”</p><p>At the side, although Zhao Yundi was shocked after witnessing that Tang Xiu’s phone call was able to make Wei Xiqing come within five minutes, he immediately rolled his eyes after hearing the conversation between the two men. “Hey, surnamed Wei, little did I expect that a Director like yourself can unexpectedly kiss people’s asses like this too, huh. But how old is this dude, huh? A young divine doctor? What a joke!”</p><p>Tang Xiu looked at him wearing a faint smile. Is this fella looking for a smack on the face?</p><p>As expected, Wei Xiqing looked angry upon hearing Zhao Yundi’s words. Although he was quite afraid of his identity, he still scolded him, “Zhao Yundi, I’ve already called your grandfather and I’m sure he’ll soon send some people to drag you back! And how can you understand the status of Divine Doctor Tang to begin with? Take your men and quickly get out of here! Else the Zhao Family won’t be able to save your ass if the matter here goes big!”</p><p>Furious, Zhao Yunde grabbed his pistol and aimed it at Wei Xiqing. He then angrily growled, “Surnamed Wei! Don’t smear your face with shame! I must bring my sister back today, or else watch how I tear down your Virus Research Institute.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
