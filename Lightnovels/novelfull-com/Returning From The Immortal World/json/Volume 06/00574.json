This time, the situation prolonged for a very long time, and only after three hours did Tang Xiu finally awake from his deep sleep. He could feel a cooling aura around him, and the first thing that came to his sight after he opened his eyes was Kang Xia’s beautiful face.</p><p>“I… did I fall asleep?” Tang Xiu felt that it was a bit inconceivable.</p><p>Kang Xia’s immersion in cultivation was interrupted, as she opened her star-like pupils and smilingly said, “Yes! You fell asleep while standing.”</p><p>“My state of confusion and bewilderment drove my mental state down.” Tang Xiu revealed an awkward and wry smile. “I didn’t expect that I… Ah, that’s right, was the fluctuation of the world spiritual energy caused by your cultivation?”</p><p>Blinking her eyes, Kang Xia released herself from Tang Xiu’s hold and ran about five meters away to a clean spot and sat on it. Two minutes later, she stood up with a dull expression and then looked at Tang Xiu with a face full of a puzzled expression, saying, “It’s strange. My cultivation speed was so fast when I was hugging you before. It was so fast to the extent that I don’t how many times it’s compared to when I practice by myself. But after separating from you, my cultivation speed returned to its previous state.”</p><p>“What did you say?” Tang Xiu stared blankly before immediately asked with a surprised expression.</p><p>“My cultivation speed was very fast when I was being by hugged you, but it turned very slow when we separated.” Kang Xia said, “The warm current inside my body has doubled within just a few hours and above all, my control over them has become easier.”</p><p>Tang Xiu looked down at himself and thought for a while before figuring out the reason. His present cultivation level was already very high, and it caused his body to constantly absorb the energy from the stars and the sun, hence with the Heaven and Earth spiritual energy as a medium, the world energy around him became richer than elsewhere. While Kang Xia cultivated at his side, it was equivalent of practicing in a place where the spiritual energy was richer by many times, hence the reason why her cultivation speed was naturally faster.</p><p>Immediately, after Tang Xiu explained the reason, Kang Xia was no longer shocked and felt happy instead. She kept pestering Tang Xiu, causing the latter to allow her to stay by his side more often later.</p><p>“That’s right, how were the sales of our new products?” Just as Tang Xiu remembered this matter, he quickly asked about it.</p><p>A smile blossomed on Kang Xia’s beautiful face upon hearing his question, as she replied with a sigh, “The information relayed from our exclusive stores all over the country showed that the lowest sales rate from the slowest exclusive store had all the healthcare products sold out in only two and a half hours.”</p><p>“It seems Long Zhenglin’s idea was really great!” Tang Xiu stared blankly and praised. “This brat will surely run home to find his old man and ask his support given that he’s in a very poor state recently. Anyhow, after you return to Star City, give him his dividend according to his share, and tell him that the next dividend will be shared by the end of the year.”</p><p>“No problem.” Kang Xia said with a smile, “The Magnificent Tang Corp. doesn’t lack funds for the time being. Also, I’ve pressed and allocated some funds in our account book to be prepared for the Star City’s New City real estate next year. Another big part of our funds are currently being spent on opening more production lines for several products.”</p><p>“Since you’re the one managing the business, I believe you can do it well.” Tang Xiu said, “Anyways, since you are in Shanghai, how about we stroll around and look for a suitable place for the future HQ of our company?”</p><p>Kang Xia’s eyes lit up and agreed.</p><p>In the next two days, Kang Xia was very busy and was only able to snatch brief moments of leisure from work. She returned to Bluestar Villa Complex every night, and yet still dealt with work issues, holding video conferences with the top executives of the Magnificent Tang Corporation. During the day, she followed Tang Xiu everywhere to find a good plot of land. Finally, the two saw a wide undeveloped area on the border of Shanghai City and Su region.</p><p>Following which, Tang Xiu contacted the people from real estate sector in Shanghai and learned the estimated price to purchase the land and the various legal procedures to complete the formalities. After that, Kang Xia transferred a batch of manpower from Star City and temporarily recruited some people skilled in real estate in Shanghai. She formed an ad-hoc team that was solely responsible and had full authority to purchase the land.</p><p>What made Tang Xiu and Kang Xia quite happy was that they were able to recruit a very famous real estate broker, Tang Chenghe, with the help of a headhunting company. In addition, the Jinda Real Estate’s boss—Jin Xingkui also contacted and used his wide network and connections before they were finally able to purchase a large area of land at 1.98 billion yuan.</p><p>Afterward, Tang Xiu gave the full authority to handle the matter to Kang Xia and Tang Chenghe, whereas he returned to Shanghai University and back to his relaxed life, attending classes and going to the library every day.</p><p>****</p><p>Beijing, the ancestral residence of the Tang Family.</p><p>More than a dozen core members of the Tang Family had gathered here. Everyone was facing a mobile phone placed on the table in front of them with its loudspeaker volume turned to the maximum.</p><p>“Father, the news spread out quickly and all the forces and various big families that had been directly oppressed or suffered a lot of losses by the Yao Family are all in secret contact with each other. As of now, the entire capital is very calm and tranquil, but surging undercurrents are brewing in secret. I’m sure that within a matter of days, those parties will strike the Yao Family following the death of Yao Qingzun and the losses of their family’s strength.” Tang Yunpeng’s fingers clamped a lighted cigarette. Though he spoke like that in his mouth, yet his mind was full of admiration toward his nephew.</p><p>He had never expected that the Tang Family could have any relations to cultivators whatsoever prior to this. But now, not only did the Tang Family have the relationship with such existences, even his nephew was a cultivator himself, and also groomed over a hundred cultivators. He felt that such a huge force was enough to sweep away all the forces in China.</p><p>In particular, the smile on Tang Guosheng’s face was also very bright. The Yao and Tang Families were sworn, mortal enemies, and all the families with a bit of power in the country were also aware of the situation between them. The news of the Tang Family having devastated the Yao Family’s forces and compelled Yao Qingzun to death had naturally spread out and created a sensation.</p><p>The Tang Family, however, did not announce any news to the outside, whereas the information on the documents pertaining the deeds of the Yao Family was released by Tang Yunqing in secret. They could even guarantee that no one from those families and forces would be able to investigate and trace the source back to the Tang Family.</p><p>“Those people don’t want us to ruthlessly eradicate the Yao Family, hence we’ll stay idle on our boat amid the storm and calmly watch the tense situation in the capital. The Yao Family… hmph, to cut a grass without roots will only need the coming breeze of the spring. God knows what kind of talented people will spring up in the Yao Family, but who knows to what extent they can slowly restore themselves in this situation? Everyone knows that keeping this family in existence is akin to keeping a disaster alive.”</p><p>“You’re right, Big Brother.” Tang Guoshou repeatedly nodded. “The Yao Family has too deep a foundation, hence we must cut off their rear as far as possible so that they won’t be able to recover from this situation.”</p><p>“Even after resorting to using that information, had the Yao Family not been that powerful for so many years and many of their family members not having offended and strong-armed too many people before, I’m afraid that no one would be willing to take the initiative to stand up against the Yao Family at all.” Tang Guosheng sighed, “When heaven sends calamities down, there’s hope of weathering them, but when a man brings them upon himself, there’s no hope of escaping them whatsoever!”</p><p>Amid the conversation between the three elders of the Tang Family, the mobile phone in front of Tang Guosheng suddenly rang.</p><p>“Speak…”</p><p>After looking at the caller’s name, Tang Guosheng immediately spoke in a loud voice.</p><p>“Senior Tang, a junior of the Yao Family, Yao Xindi, was gravely injured by a junior from the Wang Family and was taken to the hospital for treatment. At the same time, Yao Xindi’s father, Yao Chengheng, was hit by a speeding car on the roadside near a specialties store and shouldn’t be able to be rescued.” A deep and low voice transmitted from the phone.</p><p>Tang Guosheng’s pupils contracted and he was silent for two minutes, before he slowly replied, “Keep watching. I need to know all the news about the Yao Family first hand.”</p><p>“Understood!”</p><p>After hanging up, Tang Guosheng looked at the others and spoke, “The first family has finally jumped out to strike the Yao Family. Yao Chengheng was hit by a car, and his son Yao Xindi was severely beaten by a junior from the Wang Family. It seems that the Wang Family is the one who hates the Yao Family the most aside from us.”</p><p>“Interesting, this is really interesting.” Tang Guosheng laughed strangely. “I once heard that Yao Chengheng had a grudge with that kid from the Wang Family during the construction of Jinhua Shopping Center, and several clashes broke out between them after that. I have a feeling that the Wang Family doesn’t have the courage to directly clash with the Yao Family alone. Perhaps they have collaborated with one or more other families. Let’s wait, I’m sure that soon some people will jump out and strike at the Yao Family.”</p><p>Sure enough, another incident occurred less than an hour after Yao Chengheng was hit by a car and Yao Xindi was beaten. An upscale club on the Fourth Ring Road in Beijing suddenly caught on fire. An important member who was responsible for the venue was killed in the fire along with seven or eight experts of the Yao Family and two of their financial accountants.</p><p>Following that, a few group companies under the Yao Family’s flag were allegedly held responsible for tax evasion and defrauding their revenues and were forced to pay rectification. Some were closed down after failing to pass the required fire control measures standard after the inspection from the Fire Control Bureau.</p><p>Some project sites under the Yao Family were also heavily inspected and checked for serious quality problems. The workers were driven away and the construction sites were sealed up. Series of measures were then employed, giving heavy blows to the Yao Family.</p><p>****</p><p>These news flew like snowflakes to the Tang Family. In just two days, the losses suffered by the Yao Family were enormous. It was heard that the new Head of the Yao Family—Yao Chengdong even had his hairs turned white overnight due to worry and restlessness.</p><p>Tang Xiu, who was in Shanghai, had been following the situation in the capital as well. When the Tang Family first began their assault on the Yao Family, he already guessed that the Yaos wouldn’t be able to pass this hurdle.</p><p>As far as enemies were concerned, Tang Xiu never had any mercy. Had it not been because of the urging from his grandfather, he wouldn’t have to borrow others’ knives for killing and eradicating the Yao Family. But seeing such a colossal force begin to crack without wasting an ounce of his strength, he was still delighted nonetheless.</p><p>Shanghai University’s male students’ dormitory.</p><p>When Tang Xiu hung up in a good mood, Hu Qingsong suddenly ran inside. When he saw Tang Xiu sitting in front of the bookcase, he immediately asked, “Big Bro Tang, I’m gonna buy something outside, are you coming with me?”</p><p>“What are you going to buy?” Asked Tang Xiu.</p><p>Hu Qingsong grinned, “Don’t ask, alright? I’m very happy now, so are you coming with me or not? I guarantee you will definitely be satisfied!”</p><p>Tang Xiu put away his phone as he got up and smilingly said, “Since you said that, then I’ll go with you! Beware, though. If the place doesn’t satisfy me, then dinner’s gonna be on you!”</p><p>“No problem!” Hu Qingsong straightened up his chest and guaranteed.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
