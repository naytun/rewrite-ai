He definitely won’t give up the position of family head neither will he stay abroad so willingly just to deal with ordinary businesses.”</p><p>“The Yao Family is still hiding loads of secrets, it seems,” said Tang Xiu slowly. “Hmph, no matter how many secrets they hide, as long as they dare to oppose the Tang Family, then what awaits them is only extermination! Yang Le, answer me seriously, how is the relationship between you and your eldest senior brother?”</p><p>Yang Le was silent for a while, before he shook his head with a bitter expression and said, “It’s not good. Our relationship is so bad that, even if we aren’t enemies, we will never become friends either.”</p><p>“That’s not enough. Help me out, you will become a friend of mine later, regardless. Also, don’t forget that you have given me your word that you’ll help me for that opportunity,” said Tang Xiu.</p><p>“I’m on board a pirate ship or something?” Asked Yang Le with a forced smile.</p><p>“You can regard it as you like!” Said Tang Xiu calmly.</p><p>“What do you want me to do, then?” Asked Yang Le.</p><p>“I’ll send people to investigate the memorandum of understanding draft currently being prepared by the Yao Family and the government. You must steal it if it’s necessary. As long as the MoU draft is missing, it will affect their progress and bring about a lot of troubles to them. Nevertheless, this is only a small part of my plan. We’ll talk about the rest of the plan later,” said Tang Xiu.</p><p>“What shall we do next, Grand Master?” Asked Gu Xiaoxue.</p><p>“Prepare to set off immediately to have a look at Clam Island. If the place is really suitable for the implementation of our plan, we must snatch it from the Yao Family no matter what means we employ. Yao Xinhua is a very talented guy and he’ll definitely become the main pillar of the Yao Family in the future. We’ll make him stay in the South China Sea for good if possible!” Said Tang Xiu.</p><p>“I’ll prepare the boat now, Grand Master,” said Gu Xiaoxue.</p><p>“I’ll go with you,” said Yang Le hastily upon hearing it.</p><p>After silently watching the two of them leave, Tang Xiu re-read the information of the investigation conducted by the Everlasting Feast Hall. Countless thoughts swirled inside his mind as he silently thought of how to pay the lowest price and obtain the maximum benefits.</p><p>In the hallway, Yang Le looked at Gu Xiaoxue with sparkling eyes and curiously asked, “Xiaoxue, why did you call Tang Xiu Grand Master? Is he really your Master’s Master?”</p><p>“Yes,” Gu Xiaoxue smilingly nodded.</p><p>Touching his chin, Yang Le said with a curious expression, “Properly speaking, your Master should be old already, no? With such an old age, yet still willing to acknowledge Tang Xiu as a Master means that Tang Xiu truly has the ability. I…”</p><p>As he spoke up to there, Yang Le suddenly felt that an invisible hand had grabbed his throat, causing him to be unable to utter a single word. However, what panicked him the most was not this, but the fact that he lost control over his own body. An invisible force had wrapped him and quickly lifted and hung him upside down in the hallway.</p><p>“GHOST!!!”</p><p>While being hung upside down, as Yang Le tried desperately to loosen his neck, he suddenly saw Gu Xiaoxue making hand seals. He was as though being hung up inside the Ashura hell filled with lava, surrounded by a mountain of corpses and rivers of blood, whereas countless fiendish forms and evil spirits appeared inside.</p><p>While standing in front of Yang Le, the corner of Gu Xiaoxue’s mouth formed an arc of a smile as she turned around and walked away. Since Yang Le saw her, his eyes shined whenever he saw her, and that made her feel annoyed. If not because she was in front of her Grand Master, she would have made Yang Le suffer already. And now, he even dared to vilify her Master’s age, it’s something that forbearance was no longer able to tolerate!</p><p>Only now did Yang Le regretted it. Had he known earlier that Gu Xiaoxue, whose beauty was akin to a celestial fairy, turned out to be a cruel and merciless woman with such terrifying abilities, he wouldn’t have dared to provoke her even if he was killed! He would even stay far away from her and hide.</p><p>The hellish world made Yang Le’s legs shiver. If he could, he really wouldn’t wait to beg and ask for mercy, hoping that Gu Xiaoxue could put him back.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>Three ghostly figures silently appeared in the hallway. Quirky expressions were painted on the faces of three stalwart men upon seeing Yang Le’s appearance.</p><p>“I forbid you to put him down!” An erratic voice rang at the ears of the three burly men.</p><p>Immediately, the three big men let out a strange smiles, as all of them then retreated.</p><p>Inside a luxury suite, Tang Xiu could clearly hear Yang Le’s ‘loud prayers’ for help. When he released his spiritual sense and saw Yang Le hung upside down in the hallway, he was at a loss between laughter and tears. Although he didn’t know how Yang Le made Gu Xiaoxue feel annoyed, he didn’t feel like helping and putting him down since it was Gu Xiaoxue’s doing.</p><p>Ten minutes later, Han Qingwu walked down the hallway under the guidance of a woman. She wore an inconceivable expression when she saw Yang Le, who was hanging up upside down in the hallway.</p><p>“He, he, he, how did he…” Han Qingwu approached Yang Le and turned around to ask the woman with a stuttering voice.</p><p>The woman smilingly said, “I don’t know, either. But no one else in this restaurant is able to do such a feat except Boss and Little Boss.”</p><p>Nodding in response, Han Qingwu circled around Yang Le for a few times. She then raised her finger to touch her chin and a slightly blurred expression glinted in her eyes as she murmured, “I seem to possess this ability as well. But, it’s kinda strange that there’s nothing binding him and no restraints keeping his feet planted on the top of the hallway and hanging him upside down like this, though. How should I do it?”</p><p>Taken aback, the woman asked in astonishment, “Are you also a cultivator, Miss Han?”</p><p>Han Qingwu furrowed her brows and inquired, “Cultivator? The term feels somewhat familiar to me. It’s really strange. I seem to know tons of things, yet I don’t seem to know anything about them either. Ugh… my head hurts…”</p><p>At this time, an erratic voice rang in Han Qingwu’s ear, “Since you can’t recall it, you shouldn’t try to recall it deliberately. You will remember it one day, I believe.”</p><p>“Tang Xiu?”</p><p>Han Qingwu was startled and immediately walked forward. After opening the door to the luxury suite, she then saw Tang Xiu quietly sitting in the hall while smoking.</p><p>“You still don’t want to tell me about that, Tang Xiu?” Asked Han Qingwu.</p><p>“Being anxious is not needed, for the time has yet to come for you, I think.” Tang Xiu shook his head. “And I believe that you will remember everything you once knew sooner or later, regardless. Also, I already told you that I have important things to deal with in coming to Jingmen Island this time, so I don’t have the time to accompany you sightseeing. If you feel that the service provided by the Everlasting Feast Hall is unsatisfactory, you can leave on your own.”</p><p>Han Qingwu rolled her eyes and grunted, “Who said the services provided by the Everlasting Feast Hall are unsatisfactory? They prepared me the best room, and the service they provide me is great. I even decided to stay here before you finished dealing with your business.”</p><p>“If anything, there are many rules and customs you need to observe and obey in the Everlasting Feast Hall.” Tang Xiu nodded. “If you want to stay here comfortably with vacation in mind, it’s best not to violate the customs here. Tell me, is there something you need from me?”</p><p>“I just wanna ask how long it will take for you to finish your things,” said Han Qingwu. “The campus only gave me a short time for vacation.”</p><p>“I don’t know how long it will take,” said Tang Xiu. “If your vacation is over and I have yet to finish dealing with my business, you can go back by yourself!”</p><p>“Okay! Pay attention to your safety, then.” Han Qingwu gently nodded after hesitating for a while.</p><p>Tang Xiu let out a faint smile, “I’m not a kid anymore. I know how to take care of myself. Anyways, are you hungry? I’ve already instructed someone to prepare a meal. They should be delivering it soon.”</p><p>“I just so happen to be starving,” said Han Qingwu with a smile.</p><p>After the savory dishes were delivered, Tang Xiu broke the illusion array that restricted Yang Le and brought the ghastly pale Yang Le back to the hall. After putting him on the sofa, he said, “I’m not related to whatever bitter experience you’ve just encountered. She wouldn’t have taught you a lesson if you didn’t say something that annoyed or made her upset. Just take a rest and eat. Important are already waiting for us after eating.”</p><p>Crawling up from the sofa, Yang Le’s eyes were still filled with fear. He said in a trembling voice, “B-brother Tang, y-you… h-how do you have so many monsters? T-that X-xiao… T-that Gu Xiaoxue looks like a celestial fairy… b-but s-she’s m-more frightening-than a-a witch.”</p><p>“I just heard someone shouting ‘Ghosts!’. That should be you, no?” Tang Xiu chuckled. “Anyhow, you’re someone from the Occult Sect. It would really be a huge joke if people from the Occult Sect feared ghosts, don’t you think?”</p><p>Cough, cough… Yang Le choked and laughed, and his handsome face turned beet red.</p><p>Han Qingwu’s eyes widened in astonishment, “Ehh? I never thought that Mr. Yang Le, whose mouth is so amazingly sharp, would blush out of embarrassment. It’s really unthinkable. Then, I guess the person who said that word before should be him, right? Or else he wouldn’t have blushed in embarrassment like this.”</p><p>“You guys…”</p><p>Yang Le was miffed out of embarrassment. He fiercely glared at Tang Xiu and Han Qingwu as he staggeringly stood up and turned to leave, “Hmph, I’m full already. I’ll be waiting for you outside.”</p><p>“Hahaha…” Han Qingwu burst into laughter.</p><p>Just after dinner, Gu Xiaoxue hurried back. There was an invitation envelope in her hand as she came to Tang Xiu’s front and said, “Grand Master, this is an invitation from the Ouyang Family. They are holding a charity banquet in Sheraton Hotel. They hope the Everlasting Feast Hall can participate in the event. Also, I just received news that Yao Xinhua, who is currently in Jingmen Island, has also received this invitation.”</p><p>Yao Xinhua?</p><p>A cold glint flashed in Tang Xiu’s eyes as he nodded and said, “Since someone from the Yao Family will go, then I’ll personally attend it as well. I will let that brat know who will send him to hell in the future.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
