When the time comes, after you’ve completely relieved yourself from this problem, you can go out with me again.”</p><p>Gu Yan’er smilingly nodded and snuggled around Tang Xiu for a long time. Then she raised her head and smilingly asked, “How did you find the Chrono Crystal, Master?”</p><p>“At first, I thought that it would be impossible for the Chrono Crystal to exist on Earth, so I had already planned to wait until I can break through the atmosphere and go to the star fields outside Earth to find it.” Tang Xiu smilingly explained. “But who would have thought that my subordinate’s men who were protecting a pair of explorers during an Alps Mountains’ exploration accidentally found the Chrono Crystal. That subordinate of mine didn’t know what the Chrono Crystal was, but she realized that the object was a very precious mineral, so she came to Shanghai to deliver it to me.”</p><p>“It seems my luck is really good, Master.” Gu Yan’er suddenly understood and smilingly replied. “Also, I realized that there are many good objects on Earth—many kinds of treasures that even countless people in the Immortal World will fight desperately for. I suspect that there must be an important reason for this.”</p><p>“That’s right. A pity that my current cultivation level is too low. There are many places on Earth that I don’t dare to easily rush in right now.” Tang Xiu nodded. “But you, you can stroll around for Master after you’ve completely refined that Shade Demon Black Force inside your body. I’m sure that you won’t have any problem at all later.”</p><p>With eyes lit up, Gu Yan’er was slightly excited as she nodded, “I’ll try my best to completely refine this Shade Demon Black Force, Master.”</p><p>After that, the master and disciple conversed for a long time as Tang Xiu then said with a smile, “I told Ji Chime, Light, and Dark to stay outside because I got the Chrono Crystal and Demonic Revival Grass to heal you. Since you are awake now, tell them to come in!”</p><p>“Master, though inside my body the Shade Demon Black Force is a hidden danger, it won’t be a problem for me to stay outside for one or two hours every day. Besides, I also want to go out and have a bite with you. We don’t need to call them inside, let us go out straightly!”</p><p>After pondering for a moment, Tang Xiu nodded and said, “In that case, we can go out then. But you need to remember that you must not leave the exquisite pagoda for more than two hours later. It’s best that you don’t try to go out as far as possible.”</p><p>“Alright!” Gu Yan’er nodded with a smile.</p><p>Outside the exquisite pagoda, Ji Chimei was sitting cross-legged, whereas Light and Dark were also sitting cross-legged in cultivation. Only Gu Xiaoxue was anxious and paced back and forth. She didn’t know why her Grand Master came to Jingmen Island all of a sudden, neither did she know why he would enter the exquisite pagoda and stay there for a long time and still not come out.</p><p>Bam…</p><p>The pagoda’s door automatically opened and two figures floated out from the interior.</p><p>“Ma… Master?” Gu Xiaoxue trembled and disbelief burst out of her eyes.</p><p>Ji Chimei, Light and Dark also opened their eyes instantly. When they caught sight of Gu Yan’er coming out arm in arm with Tang Xiu, shocked expressions immediately plastered on their faces, because they were well aware of Gu Yan’er’s situation. She should still be in slumber, properly speaking, and it would take several years for her to wake up.</p><p>But how… how come she woke up?</p><p>“Master! (Lord!)” Light and Dark, as well as Ji Chimei, saluted hurriedly.</p><p>Gu Yan’er let out a smile and said, “Looking at your shocked faces is quite amusing. You all had never expected that I would wake up now, did you?”</p><p>Gu Xiaoxue was all smiling and full of joy as she dashed toward Gu Yan’er. She hugged her and spoke in a trembling voice, “We didn’t. We never expected that you would wake up now, Master. It’s really great. It must be because of Grand Master. He surely has found a way to cure you!”</p><p>Gu Yan’er faintly smiled, “Well, my injury has basically recovered, but I have not yet solved some special problems, though. Anyhow, I will not fall into a comatose state again nonetheless, and only need to cultivate every day before I’ll be able to fully remove the hidden dangers in my body several years later.”</p><p>\"Really?\" Gu Xiaoxue was fully excited and so did the three others.</p><p>At the Everlasting Feast Hall.</p><p>The news of Gu Yan’er’s reappearance spread to every core disciple of the Everlasting Feast Hall. Furthermore, they also received a message that Gu Yan’er would be taking charge of the Everlasting Feast Hall later on, and would come out from her secluded cultivation once in a while to give instructions in their cultivation.</p><p>Shortly after, Tang Xiu dined with Gu Yan’er and then stayed in the Everlasting Feast Hall. Although his curriculum at Shanghai University was delayed, he still wanted to spend more time with Gu Yan’er. Only a week later did he finally bade her farewell and returned to Shanghai.</p><p>The following instances in life for him were still the same. Aside from attending classes at the campus, Tang Xiu imparted medical skills to Dai Xinyue, while spending the rest of the time reading books or cultivating. His time was spent in bliss and happiness. Only until it was near the New Year’s did he finally go to Jingmen Island and spent two days with Gu Yan’er.</p><p>The business of the Magnificent Tang Corporation was getting better and better with each passing day. Every product was still in short supply and was sold out like getting robbed every time they were put on the shelves. With the accumulation of funds, the time Kang Xia spent in Star City was also getting lesser and lesser. Aside from setting up branches in the provinces across the country, she also spent half of her time in Shanghai to negotiate the land acquisition agreement with the government, as well as contacting the construction company to establish the new HQ edifice and two large factories for the Magnificent Tang Corporation.</p><p>Close to the end of the year, on the first day of vacation, Tang Xiu received an unexpected phone call.</p><p>“Excuse me, are you Grand Master Tang Xiu?” A timid voice belonging to a young man came out of the phone.</p><p>Tang Xiu knitted his brows and inquired, “I’m Tang Xiu, may I ask who you are?”</p><p>The tone of the other party was obviously excited and quickly answered, “I’m Chen Tong, Grand Master.”</p><p>Chen Tong?</p><p>Tang Xiu was stunned and stared blankly before snapping back to his senses as he realized that the young man was Chen Zhizhong’s son. He once heard Chen Zhizhong saying Chen Tong’s name before. Suddenly, he let out a faint a smile and asked, “Is there something you need from me?”</p><p>“Grand Master, my Dad once said that you’re a miracle-working doctor, could you lend me your assistance? My classmate has just contracted a strange disease and it's highly contagious. And now she’s being isolated at the Beijing Virus Research Institute. Could you save her?”</p><p>“If this strange disease she has contracted is very contagious, there should be some people from the government agency involved, right? What exactly is the diagnosis?”</p><p>“There hasn’t been any reply from them.” Chen Tong replied astringently. “I spent quite a lot of money and only barely managed to get some news. It’s said that the virology experts and professors at the National Virus Research Institute still couldn’t figure out how this new type of virus was formed. However, I heard that my classmate has been put under the critical notice, and she may not be curable if no available means for a cure are found.”</p><p>After thinking about it for a moment, Tang Xiu then said, “Let’s do it this way! I’m now heading to Beijing and we’ll discuss the details when I get there. Also, I’ll text my flight number and the arrival time after I have booked the flight ticket.”</p><p>“Yes yes yes. Thank you, Grand Master,” said Chen Tong gratefully.</p><p>As the phone call ended, Tang Xiu called Yuan Chuling, as the two had originally agreed to return to the Star City, whereas he must change his destination for the time being and was unable to go back with him. After hearing that Tang Xiu couldn’t go back to Star City for the time being, Yuan Chuling also decided to stay in Shanghai. The fitness center he had been tinkering with was planned to open for business after the New Year, and he decided to start the business before the new year since he wouldn’t be returning for the time being.</p><p>In the middle of the day, Tang Xiu walked out of Beijing Airport and glanced around. [1] He then caught sight of a young man with bleached yellow hair and a white down coat slightly running towards him. He brought two umbrellas with him because it was raining outside.</p><p>\"Chen Tong?\" Asked Tang Xiu.</p><p>“I’m Chen Tong, Grand Master,” said Chen Tong quickly. “But you… why are you wearing so few clothes? The temperature in Beijing has fallen below zero, please wear my down coat.”</p><p>Having said that, he took off his down coat and handed it over to Tang Xiu.</p><p>Tang Xiu waved his hand to stop him. He didn’t feel cold at all though he was only wearing casual clothes; he could easily adjust the temperature around him with his current cultivation. With a smile, Tang Xiu spoke, “If my memory serves me correctly, your father said that you are studying abroad. How did you come to Beijing now?”</p><p>Chen Tong forced a smile, “The curriculum on my campus is quite relaxed, thus I had an early vacation. Four days ago, I accompanied my classmate back to Beijing since her family lives here. We originally intended to have a good stroll around for a few days before returning to Star City. Who would have thought that on the plane back here she began to have a high burning fever that didn’t ease even a bit. She was then sent to the hospital after we arrived in Beijing and was finally diagnosed to have contracted a viral disease. I myself was supposed to be isolated as well, but I took the opportunity to slip away. Ah, right, Grand Master, all the passengers on the flight back here are also being isolated because of my classmate. Even everyone who had contact with her, including the doctors and nurses, have also been isolated too after we got off the plane.”</p><p>“How many people are there, the specific number?” Asked Tang Xiu.</p><p>“More than 200 people,” said Chen Tong. “Also, more than half of them began to have a high burning fever, which is the same as the symptoms of my classmate.”</p><p>“And you, are you alright?” Asked Tang Xiu with a frown.</p><p>“It’s kind of strange now that you ask me.” Chen Tong shook his head. “Although Dad forced me to practice martial arts since childhood and my physical fitness was always great, but the virus can be transmitted by saliva, air, and direct contact with the infected. She and I are lovers and we even shared a kiss, but nothing has happened to me until now.”</p><p>Tang Xiu furrowed his brows as he reached out to grab Chen Tong’s wrist. After checking his pulse, he found that he indeed wasn’t infected by any symptoms of the virus.</p><p>“Oh?” Tang Xiu felt a wave of energy fluctuation from Chen Tong. He quickly pulled the red string worn on his neck and then saw the talisman he once refined was now being worn by him.</p><p>“Your Dad really does love you, since he actually gave this important protective amulet I gave him to you. Let’s go, take me to the Virus Research Institute.”</p><p>Chen Tong shivered and hurriedly said, “Grand Master, I won’t be able to go to the Virus Research Institute! You don’t know, but a lot of people are currently looking for me, including people from the Public Security Bureau. I will definitely be detained and isolated if they catch me. And I heard that if they can’t find a cure, then it’s equal to being sentenced to death.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
