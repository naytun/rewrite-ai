As for the existence of the Stygian Club, he had long known that such colossal powers existed in the world, such as the force that had laid their hands on his father. He had also sent people to investigate the Stygian Club and was sure that he would soon receive detailed information on it soon.</p><p>Wealth and armed forces were now the two most important issues that Tang Xiu put his thought into aside from promoting his cultivation. With a steady stream of accumulated wealth, unceasing allocation of the money to develop armed forces, and training a large number of elite martial artists would be required to have more power to speak in the world.</p><p>Inside the villa, Tang Xiu put all these thoughts in the back of his mind before imparting some medical knowledge to Dai Xinyue and returning to his bedroom on the second floor. Yang Le had left in secret, whereas Chi Nan had taken Yao Qinglong away and was preparing to bring him overseas in secret to receive his wealth.</p><p>Tang Xiu was not the kind of man whose words were so heavy like sacred tripods, for he too would sometimes go back on his word against a foe like this time. To those who were on his side, however, he always kept his promises.</p><p>The next day, just as Tang Xiu arrived at the campus, Mu Wanying stopped him at the campus entrance. She obviously put on some light makeup and a stylish dress, revealing her eye-catching distinctive beautiful looks.</p><p>“Sweetheart, can you skip classes today?” Mu Wanying smilingly asked.</p><p>Tang Xiu couldn’t help laughing, “I’m a good student. I have never been absent without a leave. Anyhow, since sweetheart rarely speaks, it may not that impossible if the excuse is sufficient.”</p><p>Pfft…</p><p>Mu Wanying covered her mouth as she chuckled, and then said, “Anyhow, the business I run kind of flourished recently, so I earned some money. Therefore, I’m planning to buy a house, and I’m going to stay in Shanghai to expand my wings after graduation.”</p><p>“You want to stay in Shanghai? Why so?” Asked Tang Xiu, surprised.</p><p>“To avoid disputes and trouble, that’s why,” answered Mu Wanying.</p><p>“Are you talking about your family?” Asked Tang Xiu with a thoughtful expression.</p><p>The smile on Mu Wanying’s face receded, a helpless expression replacing it. She nodded and said, “Though my family is not as big as your Tang Family, it’s by far not as united as yours. If it was not because of pressure from my granddad, I’m afraid that my family would have been torn apart already. And recently, my granddad’s health is kinda deteriorating. Though no major problems have arisen, yet… my big and younger uncles have already begun to stir up some troubles. With me staying in Shanghai to expand my wings kind of leaves a way out for myself in the future!”</p><p>“Your idea is correct.” Tang Xiu nodded said, “It’s necessary to avoid troubles if you’re not ready to compete for power and authority. If so, let us go then! I’ll accompany you searching for a house.”</p><p>Mu Wanying let out a faint smile. There was something inside her heart that she didn’t speak out. Her decision to stay in Shanghai to develop herself was not entirely because of the disputes in her family, as part of the reason was related to Tang Xiu. She knew clearly well that Tang Xiu wouldn’t settle in Shanghai in the future, but he would stay for at least four years.</p><p>She was the type of woman who was very difficult to fall in love, but she would be dead set on the man she loved once she did. Despite knowing very well that Tang Xiu would continue to blossom in the future given his abilities, and for him to have only one woman was near to impossible, yet she wanted to fight for her own happiness. Thus she must take the initiative to secure her own place in Tang Xiu’s heart.</p><p>Tang Xiu came to campus on foot, so the duo strolled back to the Bluestar Villa Complex and then went to the garage.</p><p>“This is… a Koenigsegg Agera R?”</p><p>As the electric door slowly opened, Mu Wanying saw the luxury sports cars parked inside.</p><p>Tang Xiu’s eyes flickered as he suddenly remembered that when he went to Jingmen Island a while ago, his aunt, Tang Min, told him that there was a good luxury sports car abroad, so she had one ordered for him and had it delivered to the Bluestar Villa Complex.</p><p>He drove the Range Rover when he returned home and had it parked in the yard. He didn’t open the garage back then, so he hadn’t yet seen this sports car. Regarding luxury cars, he had never researched them, thus he was oblivious to their names.</p><p>Without waiting for Tang Xiu’s reply, Mu Wanying hurriedly ran toward the sports car and found that it had been covered by dust. She then looked for a towel and a bucket of water before she seriously cleaned it, a new sports car presented before them.</p><p>Tang Xiu watched Mu Wanying doing the chore. After Mu Wanying finally dropped the towel into the bucket, he smiled and said, “Alright, let’s drive this car out today since you like it so much! There’s no harm doing this once in a while.”</p><p>“It looks really great.” Mu Wanying laughed. “I have seen the appearance of this car and its presentation on a car magazine, but I have never seen it in real life, though.”</p><p>“Is this car very famous?” Asked Tang Xiu curiously.</p><p>Mu Wanying looked at Tang Xiu with a strange expression before saying, “The Koenigsegg brand really isn’t that well known among the supercars, and its popularity is far behind the Ferraris and Bugattis. But this Swedish company’s Agera R is equipped with a Twin-Turbocharged V8 engine that gives it a maximum power of 1,124 hp with a top speed of 440 km/h. The most awesome thing about this car is that it only takes 2.8 seconds to accelerate from 0-100 km/h, and an awesome 11.7 seconds to reach 300 km/h. Do you know how much it costs?”</p><p>“How much?” Asked Tang Xiu.</p><p>“10 million yuan,” said Mu Wanying with a serious face.</p><p>Despite having quite a fortune himself, Tang Xiu was still shocked by this figure. It never crossed his mind that his aunt, Tang Min, actually spent her hard-earned money like this. Before this one, the total value of those four cars was over 10 million, and now, this single car was priced at over 10 million yuan.</p><p>This… isn’t this akin to him ruining his own family?</p><p>“What do you think?” Mu Wanying laughed. “Could it be that Big Boss Tang is scared by this number?”</p><p>“It’s not like I’m scared by number. I just feel that its… way too extravagant.” Tang Xiu shook his head. “Besides, 10 million is an amount ordinary people find too difficult to get in their lifetime. To think that so much money was spent on this car is really…”</p><p>“It’s really strange.” Mu Wanying commented, “You don’t seem to know about your cars at all.”</p><p>“I went to Jingmen Island a few days ago.” Tang Xiu wryly smiled. “My aunt called me then, saying that she ordered me a car from abroad. Since she had already sent me four cars, so I was rather casual and ordering one again, as I thought that it wouldn’t matter much. After returning, I’ve been driving the Land Rover the whole time. Since Chi Nan drove that car last night, hence it’s my first time opening the garage door again after that. Who would have thought… it would be such a luxury sports car.”</p><p>“Your aunt really loves you.” Mu Wanying sighed, “Anyways, shall we go, sweetheart? Give me a drive around.”</p><p>“How about you drive it?” Tang Xiu’s face scrunched up.</p><p>“Alright, then I’ll drive it.” Mu Wanying thought for a moment before smilingly replying, “Driving this luxury sports car must be quite great!”</p><p>Two minutes later, Mu Wanying drove the Agera R sports car out of Bluestar Villa Complex. Just from the inside of the complex to the exit, it already attracted the attention of many people; even the security guards on duty stood perfectly straight and saluted more smartly than normally.</p><p>It was the sound and beauty of the car!</p><p>Tang Xiu suddenly felt that he was a silk pants, the second generation nouveau-riche who drove a luxury car with a belle. If there were red wine to savor along with cigars added, wasn’t it akin to a fairy-like life?</p><p>“How about having a few cups of wine after we see the house, Wanying? We seem to have passed by several good bars, and the atmosphere seems good,” said Tang Xiu with a smile.</p><p>“Okay!” Mu Wanying replied with a faint smile.</p><p>“Where are we going? Have you done any searching before?” Asked Tang Xiu with a smile.</p><p>“I have done an online search and quite liked the Loran Villa Complex,” said Mu Wanying. “The location of the complex is a bit far, however, and it takes more than an hour driving from my company. And it’s outside the rush hour in case of traffic jam. Century Classic Villa Complex is pretty good as well, but it’s not a single villa. I like single villas, and it’s better to have a villa with a private pool.”</p><p>Tang Xiu hesitated for a moment before replying, “Then let’s go have a look at both. We’ll see which one you finally like the most.”</p><p>“Okay!” Mu Wanying nodded with a smile.</p><p>As the Agera R drove on the avenue, it was like a strong magnet that attracted the attention of many people, who looked at them with envy and fantasizing when they would have such a cool and awesome luxury car.</p><p>****</p><p>Loran Villa Complex.</p><p>Han Jintong comfortably sat on the terrace of the villa, basking in the sun while smoking a cigarette. He had seen and gone through a lot of things with his old age. Therefore, aside from cultivation, he enjoyed the remaining years of his life every day. It could be said that he was the one who enjoyed life the most among the residents of this villa complex.</p><p>Of course…. He was also the one who had the best personal connections.</p><p>It would have been more perfect if Second Brother’s family of three come back from abroad.</p><p>He squinted his eyes to have a broad look at the distant scenery in the villa complex. A luxury sports car was slowly entering the complex, making him a bit surprised. It was because he was always spending his time basking in the sun, thus he had seen most of the luxury cars in the complex. But he was sure that he had never seen this very alluring sports car.</p><p>Is it another prodigal son playing with his new car again?</p><p>Han Jintong sighed as his vision followed the car as it finally parked in front of the Property Management Office about 200 to 300 meters away. From his position, he was able to see the car parked in front of the office.</p><p>“Huh?” When the luxury supercar parked and the man and woman got out, his expression moved and exclaimed lightly, “Tang Xiu?”</p><p>He admitted that he was old already, but he definitely wouldn’t admit that he had presbyopia at all. He could distinctly recognize that the handsome young man was Tang Xiu. He dreaded Tang Xiu’s identity very much, and he also wished to have a bit of friendship with him. A pity that his treasured granddaughter—Han Qingwu, was Tang Xiu’s teacher and there seemed to be some unpleasant things between the two; else he could hope that Han Qingwu could become Tang Xiu’s girlfriend and even better, becoming his wife in the future.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
