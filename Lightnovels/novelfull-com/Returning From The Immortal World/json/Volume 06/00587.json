He didn’t like Li Jing… No, precisely speaking, he liked Li Jing very much. He once had the fantasy of getting her into bed, but it was a pity that Li Jing didn’t have any good impression toward him whatsoever, thus he was flatly refused.</p><p>Therefore, he secretly instructed the other saleswomen to snatch Li Jing’s clients, and even gave them preferential treatment so as to make her lower her head a bit and be unable to strike a deal. And now, he had two paths for her. First, to climb in his bed like a slut, and second, to pack up her stuff and quit. As for the sale of a villa, even if her performance was up to standard, it was just something to toy her with.</p><p>“I already told you that the villa #9 has already been booked by someone else. The deposit will be transferred to the company’s account later. I understand that you badly want to sell a house, but it doesn’t mean that you can snatch the bill from someone else either, don’t you think? Very well then, ask your client whether they are willing to pick another villa, but do get the hell out if they don’t wanna.”</p><p>Tears burst out from Li Jing’s eyes. Her grievance and irritation made her want to slap Fang Qiang a few times, but her sane mind told her not to. She couldn’t afford to lose her job, otherwise she would have to sell her apartment. She needed to earn money to pay the mortgage and also send some money to her parents.</p><p>Suddenly, she remembered something and suppressed her impulse to cry, saying, “Manager, since you want to sell villa #9 to someone else, then I can forget it. But these two clients of mine are very special. Uncle Han, who lives in villa #8, seems to know them. He was very amiable and friendly towards them.”</p><p>Fang Qiang’s brows furrowed slightly and immediately mocked her, “Do you want to tell me that the Boss’ current achievement was inseparable from his capable helper—the second son of that old geezer Han?”</p><p>“Isn’t it so?” Replied Li Jing.</p><p>Fang Qiang got up with contempt and ridicule on his face as he scornfully derided, “Li Jing, do you know why you have no results in our sales center? It’s because you're too stupid. You’re too rigid and are oblivious as to how to adapt to circumstances. Do you know what decade you are living in? Shouldering the grace and benevolence from others until you die? Hmph, the present capacity of our Big Boss is more than that old geezer Han’s son in the past. Do you think that our Boss will still give face to that Old Han on his son’s account? That’s ridiculous.”</p><p>Li Jing’s glimmer of hope was blown away by Fang Qiang’s rebuttal. Unwilling as she may be, she didn’t know what else she could use to argue back.</p><p>Suddenly, courage seemed to emerge inside her heart as she secretly made up her mind. She turned around and headed to the office under Fang Qiang’s mocking smirk. Several minutes later, she obtained the cell number of her Big Boss, Chen Bin, and dialed it.</p><p>****</p><p>Shanghai, Hongtu Group.</p><p>At the moment, Chen Bin, who owned a few billions yuan in wealth, was sitting in the reception room and receiving a guest. This particular guest was a Big Boss he had invited many times already, who had more wealth and higher status in Shanghai than him.</p><p>“Brother Jin, I’ve already expressed my intention as well as presented all the estimated profits to you. As long as you’re willing to give me those few projects, I guarantee that I’ll fulfill both the quality and quantity requirements. Besides, it won’t affect your next big plan either, and we can also satisfy and make the best of both sides.” Chen Bin had been looking forward to being able to pick up some subcontracts from Jin Xingkui after the Jinda Real Estate planned to subcontract several projects.</p><p>“Brother Chen, we are all in the construction industry, so we know it inside out,” said Jin Xingkui smilingly. “However, more than ten construction companies have approached me recently, and they also offered more than you. It’s tough for me to accept it if you can’t allocate more profits.”</p><p>Chen Bin secretly scowled and criticized Jin Xingkui for being greedy, yet he kept smiling on the surface and said, “How about I reformulate the agreement with much better conditions than these, Brother Jin? Anyways, there is still some time today, would you care to have a few shots in the golf course?”</p><p>“I don’t have the leisure time you have now, Brother Chen.” Jin Xingkui shook his head and smilingly said. “I recently started a new project and am ridden with all sorts of worrying things as well. Let’s postpone it to later! We’ll have a few shots whenever we find some time later!”</p><p>Chen Bin was somewhat disappointed inside and also envious at the same time upon hearing it, and yet he couldn’t do anything about it. Jin Xingkui’s business was currently booming, and his new project especially boasted massive works and would be quite a source of money once it was completed!</p><p>Ring, ring, ring…</p><p>A call from an unfamiliar number made Chen Bin swallow back the words he was about to say. After a moment’s hesitation, he looked at Jin Xingkui and apologized before accepting the call, saying, “Chen Bin speaking, who is this?”</p><p>“Hello, Boss. I’m Li Jing, a salesperson from the Loran Villa Complex’ sales center. I really wasn’t supposed to disturb you, but I have very important thing to report to you.”</p><p>“Speak!”</p><p>Upon hearing Li Jing’s identity, Chen Bin instinctively wanted to hang up. After all, daring to call the higher-ups behind one’s immediate superior’s back was something he really didn’t like. The last sentence from Li Jing, however, made him temporarily pause and allow her to speak.</p><p>Li Jing had long considered what she would say inside her mind. It was her last hope, thus she was ready to stake everything she had even if she would get fired. Not only did she narrate what Fang Qiang had done, she even told the issues with the clients who came to buy the villa today. Finally, she said, “Boss, Manager Fang said that you’re the kind of businessman who discards your helpers after their help is made use of and the kind who only seek for profits and doesn’t care about past sentiments at all. This is the reason why I called, to tell you that even Uncle Han attaches great importance to Mr. Tang, even flattering him. Also, these two clients are driving a very luxurious sports car. I secretly checked it out on the Internet and found that his car is priced at over 10 million yuan. I think their identity must be extraordinary.”</p><p>A flame of anger blazed inside Chen Bin’s heart. It was not aimed at Li Jing but toward Fang Qiang. Outsiders may not know the relationship between him and the Han Family, but he knew perfectly well that he would only be a good-for-nothing trash now if it wasn’t for Han Jintong’s son in the past. Therefore, he always remembered the benevolence given unto him by the others and even treating Han Jintong as his own elder and a family member even though many years had passed by.</p><p>Furthermore, what startled him most was about the clients who could afford a few millions yuan luxury sports car. Their identity was probably extraordinary and couldn’t be underestimated. The waters of Shanghai were very deep, thus he always acted prudently despite having a wealth of a few billion yuan, for fear of offending someone he couldn’t afford to offend.</p><p>“Who exactly is this Mr. Tang?” Asked Chen Bin after pondering for a moment.</p><p>“It’s Tang Xiu,” answered Li Jing.</p><p>The name felt familiar to Chen Bin and he gave it a thought for a while. He heard this name somewhere but couldn’t remember it. However, for Elderly Han Jintong to feel the need to fawn upon him, this person was obviously someone whose identity was really extraordinary.</p><p>“I see. I’ll come over to the villa complex shortly.”</p><p>Having said that, he concluded the call. With a hesitant expression, he then looked at Jin Xingkui and asked, “Brother Jin, can I ask you something? Have you heard of a young man named Tang Xiu?”</p><p>Jin Xingkui stared at him with a blank face, and then his expression immediately changed. He then replied with a sinking voice, “I do know the owner of that name. Chen Bin, what are you asking Tang Xiu’s name for?”</p><p>Astute as he was, Chen Bin couldn’t help but turn more cautious after seeing Jin Xingkui’s expression, as he then replied, “A staff from the sales center of the villa complex I just developed just called. She reported a particular situation to me…”</p><p>He then explained everything he had heard cautiously and finally said, “I feel that this name is quite familiar. It’s like I’ve heard it somewhere but I can’t remember it. But you have more experience and also have a lot of personal connections, Brother Jin, hence why I asked you.”</p><p>A strange expression appeared on Jin Xingkui’s face before he shot Chen Bin a deep gaze. Following that, he got up and said, “Chen Bin, I’ve given some thought to your offer, and I’m satisfied with it. You don’t need to reformulate the agreement anymore, we can sign the contract today. However, I have a request.”</p><p>Chen Bin was dumbfounded. Astute and smart he may be, yet he was completely bewildered by Jin Xingkui’s jumping off topic. He couldn’t grasp where it was heading.</p><p>“Please say!” Said Chen Bin cautiously.</p><p>“There’s no need for Tang Xiu to pay for a villa in your villa complex,” said Jin Xingkui. “Just sell it to him for 1 yuan.”</p><p>Chen Bin instantly gasped a cold breath. At this time, he suddenly understood. No matter how the topic was shifted and circled about, Jin Xingkui just agreed to cooperate with him with the previous conditions, and it was all because of this Tang Xiu!!</p><p>This… who could this holiness be?</p><p>Not only was this person worth it for Elderly Han Jintong to fawn upon, even such a bigwig like Jin Xingkui gave up quite a large profit for him?</p><p>“Brother Jin, this Mr. Tang is…” Chen Bin cautiously explored.</p><p>“He has a lot of identities, but I won’t tell you all of them one by one,” said Jin Xingkui. “There are two points I can tell you now. Firstly, Tang Xiu is someone I can’t afford to offend. Even if there were ten of me, I would never dare to provoke him. Secondly, he’s a friend of mine and also my business partner. Though the New City Project is mainly helmed by me, he’s the major shareholder in it.”</p><p>Hiss… Chen Bin suddenly gasped upon hearing this. At this time, he rained down streams of curses toward Fang Qiang inwardly and couldn’t wait to drag and slap him fiercely. Such a powerful great personage came to buy a villa in his villa complex, yet Fang Qiang went so far as to slam the door on his face just to intentionally make things difficult for a saleswoman?</p><p>“Brother Jin, I’ll immediately rush over to the Loran Villa Complex. I’ll sell the villa to Mr. Tang for 1 yuan just like you told me to.”</p><p>“If so, then off you go and Godspeed!” Jin Xingkui nodded. “Anyways, it won’t be convenient for me to appear there. And do not mention anything about the matter between us. When you’re all done dealing with it, bring the contract to the Jinda Real Estate. I’ll be waiting for you there.”</p><p>“Brother Jin, I’ll definitely handle this matter well,” said Chen Bin with all seriousness. “As a matter of fact, I would still do it even if you didn’t tell me so. It’s because Elderly Han is my own elder, and I never dare not to listen to his words.”</p><p>Jin Xingkui smilingly nodded. He was full of admiration and adulation toward Tang Xiu inwardly. He had heard of Han Jintong’s name; an old man who didn’t expose his talents yet was very capable. The second son of this old man was once a very successful businessman in Shanghai that had developed his business into a giant entity and then immigrated overseas to expand it.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
