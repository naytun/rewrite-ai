Moreover, meeting Tang Xiu again today was particularly depressing, because he saw her at the most ridiculous and miserable situation, thus making her want to speak out all her bitter and painful experiences. The embarrassment and shame she felt inside made her unsure how to face Tang Xiu.</p><p>“What exactly do you want to explain?” Cheng Xiaowan followed along to melt the awkwardness.</p><p>Tang Xiu turned the car to a fork in the road and stopped it on the roadside with little traffic. He then opened the window, pulled out a cigarette from his pocket and silently lit it. After taking a deep puff, he turned his head to Chen Xiaowan and said seriously, “Sis Xiaowan, I’m sure you know how I was treated by Su Yaning and Su Xiangfei back then. You are her classmate and best friend and you’ve probably heard all the bad mouthing she threw at me, am I right?”</p><p>The awkwardness inside Chen Xiaowan was blown away and vanished as she sympathetically looked at Tang Xiu and nodded silently.</p><p>“When you held that birthday party for me, I felt very grateful to you because it was actually the first time I got my birthday celebrated in my whole life. Though it was stopped midway and came to a bitter end, the gratitude in my heart toward you didn’t vanish. It’s like the feeling a little brother has toward his big sis, for you made feel very warm inside.</p><p>“Do you know that you have made me encounter many of firsts in life? You’re the first person aside from my mother and grandmother who gave me pocket money, the first one who gave me a gift, the first who held a birthday party for me, and the first person to lend me a hand to make up for the missed lessons…</p><p>“I’m the only child of the family and to the eyes of others, we—an orphan and a widow staying in the Su Family Village were easy targets to be gossiped about. But I never saw contempt and despise in your eyes. As a matter of fact, I really looked at you as my own big sister, far more than Su Yaning who is of the same blood as me.”</p><p>As he spoke up to there, Tang Xiu was a bit depressed inside.</p><p>He lifted the cigarette between his fingers and took a deep puff. Along with the cloud of smoke coming out from his mouth, he continued, “That day when you held a birthday party for me, it was Su Xiangfei who asked me to come to the bathroom to get some stuff for him. I didn’t know that you were inside, so I just… Anyhow, it was only then that I figured out that Su Xiangfei definitely knew that you were taking a shower inside, hence he intentionally deceived me to go there. Like… just like before the CET, the siblings hid the money in their home, but charged a false accusation on me as the one who stole it.”</p><p>Chen Xiaowan’s eyes stared wide. Tang Xiu’s story sent a stream of warmness into her heart. But she never thought that the bottom of the story turned out to be this reason. She didn’t expect that Su Yaning and Su Xiangfei were so excessive.</p><p>In an instant, sympathy and compassion rose inside her toward Tang Xiu, and the repelling feeling she had toward him also vanished instantly.</p><p>Tang suddenly smiled, albeit a bit unsightly. “Can you imagine how my mother and I have been these past years, Sis Xiaowan? It was thanks to my mom’s hard work of running a small restaurant and the little money gave by the Su Family that we eventually barely came through. Normally, I wouldn’t have to pay the high tuition fee for the school if I was able to pass the CET and be admitted to a major university in China.”</p><p>“I became kind of muddle headed and lost my intelligence for a time. It was Su Yaning and Su Xiangfei who hid the money just to falsely accuse me. They even called the police at that time. If it wasn’t for some particular reasons and due to the arrival of a policewoman from the Crime Division of Star City Public Security Bureau who eventually revealed the truth, I’m afraid that I wouldn't be sitting here and having a chat with you now but behind bars.”</p><p>“They… they went too far! You’re their cousin, for God’s sake!” Anger painted Chen Xiaowan’s face.</p><p>“That’s why I told you that your place in my heart is much bigger than theirs.” Tang Xiu bitterly said. “They feel the same towards me, I assume.”</p><p>Chen Xiaowan grabbed his hand in an attempt to comfort Tang Xiu.</p><p>“I’m fine.” Tang Xiu shook his head and continued, “It was also that incident that made me realize that relying on others is useless, and only relying on myself will do. Hence, I set up some business and a company with all the abilities and skills I’ve learned before the CET, and the condition of my family has finally improved now.”</p><p>“I know some stuff about you. I have seen your video at this year’s Shanghai University’s freshmen welcoming party, and the one when you rendered medical services at the Star City Chinese Medical Hospital. I’m really glad that you have grown up.”</p><p>“I’ll be more than happy if you stopped being angry with me because of yesteryear’s matter.” Tang Xiu smiled.</p><p>Tang Xiu’s words touched Chen Xiaowan’s heart a lot, and her attitude toward him became more intimate as her fingers grasped Tang Xiu’s hand and said seriously, “Big Sis is not angry with you. Had I known about the causes earlier, I wouldn’t have been angry with you back then.”</p><p>Tang Xiu was happy by the answer, and then said, “Let me treat you to a dinner, Sis Xiaowan!”</p><p>“It should Big Sis treating you.” Chen Xiaowan shook her head. “I’m working in a big foreign company now, and the paycheck is quite big.”</p><p>Tang Xiu let out a faint smile in response. Suddenly, his expression moved as he said, “Sis Xiaowan, tell me if that chap pesters you again later. I’ll kick him out from Shanghai and even China.”</p><p>Upon hearing it, Chen Xiaowan’s heart pained as she nodded silently in response. After seeing Tang Xiu start the car, she suddenly spoke, “Tang Xiu, tell me. He… he won’t die, right?”</p><p>“Are you still unable to fully let him go, Sis Xiaowan?” Asked Tang Xiu as he sighed inwardly.</p><p>“How could it be easy to put such a matter down?” Chen Xiaowan bitterly said. “After all, he’s my first boyfriend and we had been together for several years. I thought I would be with him for the rest of my life, but I never thought… If anything, I’ve totally given up such illusion today at last. But still, if it’s involving such an important thing as the life of human being, I still feel…”</p><p>“I understand you.” Tang Xiu nodded. “Anyhow, it’s still early now to have dinner now. Let’s take a look at the situation over there, shall we?”</p><p>“This…” Chen Xiaowan hesitated.</p><p>Tang Xiu let out a faint smile. After driving for a while, he returned to the spot where the Audi crashed. At this time, the place had been encircled by several police cars and an ambulance was parked nearby. A tall middle-aged man dressed in a police uniform looked anxious and hurriedly directed the paramedics to lift the people in the SUV.</p><p>“Tang Xiu, take a look at… that woman!” Chen Xiaowan’s vision suddenly focused on a spot as she pointed to a woman amidst the crowd.</p><p>Tang Xiu looked around and immediately saw a woman in the crowd. She unexpectedly was the woman who had been slapped by the fat woman in the Carine Gilson lingerie store.</p><p>“Was this traffic accident machinated by her?”</p><p>Prior to this, Tang Xiu had been tightly following them from behind all the way. Naturally, he was able to figure out the real cause for the flipped over SUV.</p><p>“I’m not 100% sure, but there’s 99% chance that that woman did arrange for some someone to do it. We followed that SUV before, and I saw her sending some text messages,” said Chen Xiaowan.</p><p>“Judging from the famous brands being worn by her as well as the luxury car she drives, her identity is perhaps quite extraordinary.” Tang Xiu nodded. “She hasn’t left yet, so it’s evident that she hasn’t felt that her anger has been vented. Let’s wait and see! A problem will pop up shortly.”</p><p>“Yue Zigang and that fat woman are already like this, what else can she do?” Asked Chen Xiaowan, confused.</p><p>“Though they were plotted against, the relationship between them isn’t yet known to the husband of that fat woman—the Deputy Chief of the Police.” Tang Xiu chuckled.</p><p>Chen Xiaowan suddenly realized and said, “I understand! If that woman’s husband, the Deputy Chief of the Public Security Bureau learns about it, I’m afraid he won’t forgive them. This… isn’t this the same as a relentless pursuit to the end and strike them hard?”</p><p>“Their behavior and attitude is detestable. The way they treated and humiliated you caused her much ire and anger, and then she got slapped when she involved herself. Do you think that woman will let this matter go? Had it been me, I’m afraid that I’d be even more ruthless than that woman,” said Tang Xiu.</p><p>Chen Xiaowan was silent, as she felt that Tang Xiu’s explanation made sense.</p><p>Today Feng Kang had a very bad mood, and being sent to this place worsened it. He hadn’t yet solved the current problem on hand, yet his wife called him saying that she got into a traffic accident, causing him to rush over hastily. What made him baffled and bewildered was that there was also a handsome young man on the front seat. He was sure that he had never seen him before.</p><p>He was secretly relieved after seeing that his wife and the young man being put on the stretchers and being told by the paramedics that their lives were not in danger.</p><p>At this moment, the woman in the crowd just finished her call and then stuffed her mobile into her bag. She then whispered to another woman in her 30s to her side, as the woman then nodded and immediately rushed to the ambulance.</p><p>“Heavens! The Gods have finally opened their eyes! These two wretched people are cheating couple, and you all finally had a car accident here. This… really serves you both right! You’re both shameless to the bone.”</p><p>Feng Kang stared blankly, as anger instantly blazed inside him. He rushed toward the woman and asked in a heavy voice, “What bullshit are you spitting out?”</p><p>“Bullshit? Did I speak wrong?” The woman glared at Feng Kang and yelled back, “This lady never speaks any nonsense. These wretched two are so shameless, confessing that they have a love affair and offended many people a moment ago. They humiliate and insulting others, beating and fighting with them. That’s right, this swine-like fat woman… even shouted that her husband is the Deputy Chief of the Public Security Bureau and threatened that her husband would come to fix everyone up. Ptui! She’s simply a pig brain! Going shopping on the lingerie store with her pretty boy toy and causing public anger, yet still shouting to make her husband trash everyone. What a moron!”</p><p>Feng Kang was stupefied. This revelation from the woman before him made his whole body totally petrified.</p><p>My… my wife is cheating on me, and keeping a boy toy outside?</p><p>The tongue-lashing woman then looked at Feng Kang’s face, as she suddenly seemed to recall something before shouting again, “That’s right. The traffic accident should have been handled by the traffic police. How come the people from the Public Security Bureau came here, too? Could it be… you’re the Deputy Chief of the Public Security Bureau who got cheated by her?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
