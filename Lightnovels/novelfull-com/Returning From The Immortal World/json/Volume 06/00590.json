I’ve been wanting to contact you for years, but I wasn’t able to get your number. I even asked a lot of our schoolmates, but they didn’t know your mobile number either.”</p><p>Chen Xiaowan was also a bit excited at this time. The haziness inside her head diminished a little due to having re-established contact with Su Yaning again. She then replied, “Where are you now, Yaning?”</p><p>“I’m in Beijing! I heard from Tang Xiu that you are in Shanghai, is it true?” Said Su Yaning. “How are you? Have you been great all this while?</p><p>Chen Xiaowan was taken aback before realizing that Su Yaning got her number from Tang Xiu. Although she was a bit curious about the situation between Tang Xiu and Su Yaning, asking about it now was out of place. After spending ten minutes chatting with Su Yaning on the phone, the duo finally reluctantly hung up.</p><p>Following that, she picked up all her personal belongings, wrote her resignation letter, and then directly put it on Miao Xinran’s desk before turning around to leave without sparing her a glance.</p><p>“Your boyfriend cheated on you, and now you lost a high-paying executive job too. What a sad life! Dramatic changes are interesting indeed. As your old classmate, I hope you won’t come knocking on my door in the future as a beggar, though I’ll still give you some coins, nevertheless.” Miao Xinran curled her lips with tilted legs while folding her arms and shooting Chen Xiaowan’s back a mocking look as she left.</p><p>Chen Xiaowan’s footsteps came to a halt as she finally turned around to look at Miao Xinran and said coldly, “There’s a good saying for us all. 30 years West, and 30 years East. The pendulum swings both ways and every dog has its days. We’ll wait and see later.”</p><p>After saying that, she lifted her head up, straightened up her chest and walked toward the outside.</p><p>On this beautiful sunny day, the disconsolation and vexed feelings still made Chen Xiaowan depressed inside despite Su Yaning’s call having dispelled a lot of the haze inside her heart. As she stepped out of the company’s front entrance, standing outside while looking up at the bright sunshine, she finally took a deep sigh of relief secretly.</p><p>Ring, ring, ring…</p><p>Her mobile phone buzzed three times but was hung up directly.</p><p>Chen Xiaowan slightly furrowed her brows. She hated people that made a call and then hung up, because 80% of them were misers who wanted to save their phone bill and wanted her to call back.</p><p>“Hey, unemployed beautiful girl! Do you want this Young Master to support you?” A voice with hints of teasing came several meters away behind Chen Xiaowan.</p><p>Chen Xiaowan had a change in expression. When she looked up and saw Tang Xiu, the chagrin, anger, and embarrassed feelings inside her heart eventually turned into grievance. She never expected that Tang Xiu would witness her losing her job despite having already had witnessed her breaking up with her boyfriend. Could it be that he would always appear whenever she fell into trouble?</p><p>“How did you come here?”</p><p>Looking at her face, Tang Xiu shrugged his shoulders and said, “I was going to visit you in the Brisk Trading Group and take you out today. Who would have thought that you came out from the inside just as I was going to dial your number? Eh, did you really just get fired, Sis Xiaowan?”</p><p>Though somewhat feeling a bit depressed, Chen Xiaowan shook her head and answered, “It can’t said that I got fired. It’s more like that I resigned on my own volition! How true it is that being plagued by bad luck is in truth that you are out of luck.”</p><p>“How could this happen?” Asked Tang Xiu, taken aback.</p><p>“Let’s forget about this, shall we?” Chen Xiaowan shook her head. “Anyhow, I don’t need to ask for a leave today in any case. What plans do you have in mind?”</p><p>“Well, I’ll be accompanying you to relax,” said Tang Xiu directly.</p><p>“All right!”</p><p>\"Good!\" As she walked to a trash can outside the door, Chen Xiaowan threw all the stuff inside the box into it. Following that, she grabbed Tang Xiu’s arm and headed toward the road.</p><p>“What a beautiful sports car.” The moment they arrived before the Agera R sports car, Chen Xiaowan sighed and praised in appreciation.</p><p>Tang Xiu picked out the car keys and pressed the button as the four corner lights of the Agera R sports car flashed. Then, he turned to look to at the stunned Chen Xiaowan as he walked to the front of the passenger seat, opened its door and smilingly said, “Let me give you a ride since you are in a bad mood, Sis Xiaowan.”</p><p>“This sports car is… yours?” Asked Chen Xiaowan.</p><p>“Yeah,” replied Tang Xiu with a nod. “This is mine, your younger brother’s.”</p><p>“There’s no chance this car is a cheap one, right, Tang Xiu?” Chen Xiaowan gulped down and asked in a low voice.</p><p>“It’s not really that expensive, though. Just around 10 million!” Answered Tang Xiu while shaking his head.</p><p>“What?” Chen Xiaowan exclaimed with disbelief filling her eyes. Despite knowing that Tang Xiu was rich, yet it was out of her imagination that he could be extravagant enough to buy a luxury car worth over 10 million yuan.</p><p>Suddenly, Tang Xiu’s expression moved and asked, “Do you have a WeChat account, Sis Xiaowan?”</p><p>The sudden change of topic made Chen Xiaowan bewildered as she answered instinctively.</p><p>Tang Xiu grabbed Chen Xiaowan’s mobile and opened the WeChat app. He instructed her to make some poses in front of the Agera R sports car, took a few photos of her and then sent those pictures to her Moments friends circle while adding some comments below: Got fired by a squid in the company and feeling quite vexed and shitty right now. Hence I ask my brother to come to fetch me and go for a ride to relax. Also, I’m gonna have a big party tonight.</p><p>After feeling satisfied with sending the photos to her friends’ circle, Tang Xiu returned the mobile to Chen Xiaowan, and then forced her to enter the front passenger seat, closed the door, and drove the car away with her.</p><p>Inside the Director’s Office of the Brisk Trading Group’s Human Resources Department, Miao Xinran made coffee for herself in a brisk and happy mood. She then tilted her legs and fiddled with her mobile phone. She was very happy today, and even felt a refreshing feeling and emotion flowing through her body. Someone she always hated and a thorn in her flesh had finally been removed from the company. It made her feel that the air was full of pleasant fragrance.</p><p>“Chen Xiaowan, Chen Xiaowan, you never thought that you’d get your just deserts, did you? Hmph, you’re still worlds apart if you think you can contend against me! And now, you should be squatting in some corner of the company crying and weeping, right? Hahaha…”</p><p>This thought made Miao Xinran laugh.</p><p>Suddenly, her eyes lit up, for she knew that Chen Xiaowan often tweeted her friends’ circle in the WeChat Moments. She quickly opened WeChat as she had the urge to see her in a pitiful and tragic appearance there.</p><p>“WHAT?”</p><p>The smile on Miao Xinran face froze and disbelief was plastered on her face. Her eyes stared at the content of the latest tweet and messages in the group, causing her chin to almost fall.</p><p>“That car… isn’t it the Agera R sports car? It must be.”</p><p>The World Limited Edition Agera R Supercar was not that well-known, yet its price was ridiculously sky-high. She loved sports cars and read about it on the World Supercars magazines countless times, hence she remembered the shape and appearance of the Agera R.</p><p>Suddenly, as though realizing something, Miao Xinran strode toward the window and quickly looked outside of the building. After quickly glancing around, she caught sight of the luxurious Agera R sports car driving fast on the road. It was like the scene of a prince who came rushing into a group of beggars, looking bright and dazzling.</p><p>How could this be?</p><p>She felt her face burning. Chen Xiaowan’s Moments was like a fierce invisible slap to her face, making her scorched inside.</p><p>After she came back from Japan and obtained a position in the company, she secretly investigated the circumstances surrounding Chen Xiaowan. There had been no information from that investigation results pertaining to any rich younger brother whatsoever, right? Not any on the luxury Agera R supercar either!</p><p>Huff…</p><p>Narrow-minded as she was, the intense jealousy made Miao Xinran take a few deep breaths and clench her fists tightly. Her mind was racing unceasingly, trying to find an opportunity to get even with Chen Xiaowan, and how to make her life became more miserable.</p><p>All day long, Tang Xiu brought Chen Xiaowan for a ride, eating and drinking, and visiting a lot of entertainment venues and places with delicious culinary in Shanghai until their bellies almost burst out, ending up with a lot of shopping bags in their hands.</p><p>In the beginning, Chen Xiaowan was not used to frequently upload her activities to the Moments. But after Tang Xiu fanned the flames, she went ahead regardless and directly exploded it out without many thoughts anymore. Every time she arrived at a view spot, she tasted several kinds of food and took pictures whenever she visited a store. She eventually uploaded hundreds of photos in her Moments account in just a day.</p><p>Miao Xinran, who had been following her Moments, was simply blown up by anger. Never once had she imagined that Chen Xiaowan, who had just been dumped by her boyfriend and lost her job, would be enjoying herself by strolling around, feasting, and shopping.</p><p>Dusk finally came and Tang Xiu stopped his car outside a café. He then led Chen Xiaowan into the café and ordered two cups of coffee. After sitting on the opposite side of Chen Xiaowan, he smilingly said, “Well, we just tasted a lot of types of food today, and you are probably already full to have a dinner now, right? Anyhow, take your coffee and wait until I’m done with my work before sending you back home.”</p><p>Chen Xiaowan’s gloomy mood had long since disappeared. Today she was so happy strolling around that she nodded in satisfaction while sitting on her chair. However, she couldn’t help but ask out of curiosity upon hearing this, “What exactly are you going to do, brother?”</p><p>“I’m waiting for someone. Waiting to receive a gift, to be precise,” said Tang Xiu smilingly.</p><p>“Waiting for a gift?” Asked Chen Xiaowan with a confused expression. “How come? Today is not the New Year's or your birthday. How come someone suddenly has a thought of giving you a gift?”</p><p>“That person is my subordinate who has found something interesting, probably,” answered Tang Xiu with a smile.</p><p>Chen Xiaowan understood immediately. She then let out a smile and nodded, “Anyhow, thanks for everything today, brother. Else I would probably have died in depression.”</p><p>“You’re a big sis of mine, so there’s no need for small talk between us.” Tang Xiu said, “That’s right, what do you have in mind for the future? Do you want to work for my company, by chance? You can rest assured that you’ll have a very good position and salary, and it will definitely be higher than your previous job position by at least a few times. What do you think?”</p><p>“Hold on, let’s put off talking about this until later, okay?” Chen Xiaowan hesitated. “I just lost my job today, and it kind of left a big hole in my heart. Give me some time to rest and think about it well. You don’t know, but working in Japanese enterprises is just too hard. You have a long day and yet you must always work diligently and painstakingly all the time for fear that others will overtake you.”</p><p>“Then take a break for a while.” Tang Xiu nodded. “Shortly put, play if you wanna play, and buy whatever you wanna buy. As a big sis you used to take care of me—your little brother back then, but it’s now the turn of your younger brother to take care of you. Don’t hesitate to directly call me if you are ever short on money. I can’t guarantee exactly how much, but I can give you millions or billions as pocket money.”</p><p>Cough! Cough…</p><p>Chen Xiaowan almost choked.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
