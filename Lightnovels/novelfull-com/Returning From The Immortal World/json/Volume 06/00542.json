It covered a large area, and the entire hotel building was impressively stylish. The hotel was the first option for a lot of tourists who come from all over the country, hence the price was quite high.</p><p>On the surface, the Ouyang Family was the most powerful family in Jingmen Island. After decades in business, the position of the family was difficult for other families to catch up to regardless of whether it was business network or social connection.</p><p>Nearly all respected figures in Jingmen Island were invited to the charity party organized by the Ouyang Family; even foreign dignitaries also received invitations.</p><p>At 5 PM, a luxury car entered Sheraton Hotel. Powerful figures in well-dressed outfits entered the hotel and were warmly welcomed by Ouyang Lei as they entered the hall. At nearly 6 MP, Ouyang Lei looked at his watch, turned to look at his nearest man and asked, “How many of the invited have yet to arrive?”</p><p>“About ten plus,” whispered a gentle, middle-aged man.</p><p>Ouyang Lei squinted his eyes. As he noticed a luxury car driving in and stopping in front of him, he glanced at it and quickly came to greet, since he found that the person inside was an acquaintance. After exchanging several pleasantries, and the other party entered the hotel’s lobby, an ordinary SUV then stopped near him.</p><p>“Huh?”</p><p>Ouyang Lei’s expression moved, before it was replaced by pleasant surprise upon seeing that it was Gu Xiaoxue. However, Tang Xiu’s figure appeared as he had yet to arrive in front of Gu Xiaoxue.</p><p>“Goodness, how are you here, brother-in-law? How have you been?” Ouyang Lei directly ignored Gu Xiaoxue and walked toward Tang Xiu.</p><p>Tang Xiu rolled his eyes and looked at Ouyang Lei, whose expression was that of pleasant surprise, and then said, “Can you change your of addressing me? Even if you don’t think of me, at least do it for your younger sister, please? She isn’t married yet, and calling me brother-in-law will damage her reputation.”</p><p>Staring blankly for a moment, Ouyang Lei immediately patted his own head and said, “Ah, you’re right! My little sis isn’t married to you yet, so you can’t be considered as my in-law yet. Then, you’re my prospective brother-in-law. This address should be correct, no? Hahaha…”</p><p>Tang Xiu glanced at Yang Le, who came out from the driver seat, and said, “Remember this guy. I give you one night. Make him anxious to seek me tomorrow.”</p><p>Yang Le looked at Ouyang Lei with a strange, scrutinizing look, and then nodded with a smile, “No problem. You can consider it done already.”</p><p>“What do you mean? What is this?” Asked the confused Ouyang Lei.</p><p>“I won’t introduce you to him for the time being,” said Tang Xiu with a faint smile. “You will know who he is tomorrow. Also, I’m kind of a guest too, aren’t you going to warmly welcome me, as the host?”</p><p>Laughing, Ouyang Lei said, “That won’t be needed. I definitely won’t exchange false pleasantries with you. You can attend any charity party organized by our family whenever you want. Anyways, it’s almost time for the event to start. Let’s go inside together.”</p><p>After entering the lobby, they took the elevator to the 26th floor. When they were about to enter the banquet hall, Tang Xiu asked with inattentive expression, “I heard you also invited the Yao Family. Are they here yet?”</p><p>Looking vacant for a while, Ouyang Lei quickly realized something and hastily said, “Future brother-in-law, don’t act reasonably today! I know that your Tang Family and the Yaos clashed recently, but today, the powerful figures in the entire Jingmen Island are here. My family won’t be able to deal with the aftermath if an accident were to happen.”</p><p>“I won’t provoke them if they don’t provoke me,” said Tang Xiu with a slight smile.</p><p>Ouyang Le nodded silently, “Yao Xinhua has arrived along with several people. They should be inside right now.”</p><p>Tang Xiu no longer spoke. After entering the banquet hall with Ouyang Lei, he saw hundreds of people inside. The hall was fortunately very large, as it could accommodate thousands of people, so it didn’t seem too crowded. Under the soft illumination of the crystal lights, tables full of wine and delicacies could be seen everywhere, whereas the powerful figures were gathered in groups of three to five people and chatting on various topics.</p><p>“What is the purpose of your family in organizing such a magnificent event today?”</p><p>“Putting it plainly, it’s just a simple charity donation,” said Ouyang Lei smilingly said. “The Ouyang Family has been organizing this kind of event almost every year. However, the charity party seems to have changed its meaning along with the passage of time, though. It has become a grand meeting for private exchanges between business elites, officials, and powerful figures in Jingmen Island. As of now, every successful figure in Jingmen Island takes the invitation of my family to this banquet as an honor that they can be proud of, or something like that.”</p><p>It dawned upon Tang Xiu as he thought about how the Ouyang Family could become the most prominent influence in Jingmen Island. He was sure that they must have many other means to accumulate social connections and network all this time, and this charity party was only one of those.</p><p>“All right! You don’t need to accompany me since you’re the host of the party. Attend to your duty, we’ll have more time to talk later,” said Tang Xiu.</p><p>Ouyang Lei smilingly nodded. He indeed had the duty of entertaining the guests, since he was the future successor of the Ouyang Family. It would be quite unjustified for the other guests if he were to keep accompanying Tang Xiu.</p><p>With his departure, Gu Xiaoxue, who was walking alongside Tang Xiu, became the focus of many people’s attentions. She leaned toward Tang Xiu and whispered, “Grand Master, pay attention to the two o’clock direction. The young man in white suit, with straight combed hair to the back, is the one who is touted as the most skilled junior of the Yao Family’s latest generation… Yao Xinhua.”</p><p>Tang Xiu set his eyes ahead and saw the handsome and tall Yao Xinhua, who was now holding a glass of red wine and merrily chatting with several big figures. As if sensing that someone was watching him, Yao Xinhua glanced around for a few times before his and Tang Xiu’s eyes finally met.</p><p>Tang Xiu gave him a cool smile and then turned toward the rest area in the corner. It was his first time seeing Yao Xinhua today, and he admitted that the young man indeed possessed a silver bearing and good brains. He could tell that Yao Xinhua also had quite some abilities. This type of person may be terrifying for many people, but he was nothing to him. Maybe if that old man, the head of the Yao Family was to come here, only then would Tang Xiu pay attention.</p><p>At the two o’clock direction, after Yao Xinhua saw Tang Xiu, his expression turned solemn and serious. A cold glint flashed in his eyes, as he could feel a killing intent gushed out from him. In the first bout with the Tang Family in the Southern region, he was completely routed by Tang Xiu’s strikes. He, who was originally in high spirits and persistently delivered heavy blows on and was prepared to rout the Tang Family, finally ended up in total defeat and lost two provinces completely. It happened so fast that it ended up in vain for him. The strategy employed by the Tang Family rendered him unable to react and come to support his forces in time, and everything he did to cope with the situation was always too late.</p><p>The end result was simply miserable.</p><p>His Yao Family and the families that were on good terms with them suffered quite a heavy blow, and he was forced to retreat in defeat time and time again. All of his achievements were turned into nothing, causing him to be forced to retreat back to Beijing.</p><p>At that time he was furious and aggrieved, because he couldn’t figure out who his real adversary was. Only until later, after conducting investigations through various channels, did he finally found that the real culprit was the missing offspring of the Tang Family. The fellow named Tang Xiu, he was the one who took over the battlefield in the Southern region and literally played him this miserably.</p><p>He thus regarded Tang Xiu as his mortal enemy in this life. Even until now, he had been preparing himself, looking forward to play again with Tang Xiu in the future, to wash all the shame and humiliation he had gotten from him. However, seeing Tang Xiu all of a sudden made his heart tighten despite having already prepared himself for the occasion.</p><p>Why did he appear here?</p><p>Yao Xinhua kept his cool and wasn’t affected by the killing intent. Countless thoughts swirled inside his head, as he silently figured out the purpose of Tang Xiu appearing here. Logically speaking, Tang Xiu should now be in Shanghai studying.</p><p>Don’t tell me… it’s because my family’s plan of renting an island in the South China Sea?</p><p>As Yao Xinhua thought up to there, his heart immediately felt tight, and a vigilant look appeared in his eyes. It must be noted that this plan of the Yao Family was very important. If they could complete it, the Yao Family would continue to grow and their armed forces would progress and expand rapidly. As long as the plan went smoothly, the Yao Family would be able to stand proudly in the capital as the most powerful family.</p><p>“Excuse me!”</p><p>Keeping a cordial smile on his face, Yao Xinhua spoke to the people around him. Then, he carried his glass of red wine and walked to the corner. There, he took out his mobile phone and dialed a cell number.</p><p>“Dad, it’s me!” Spoke Yao Xinhua in a whisper.</p><p>“What is it?” A majestic voice replied from the phone.</p><p>“I met Tang Xiu in the charity party organized by the Ouyang Family in Jingmen Island, Dad,” said Yao Xinhua. “I suspect his sudden appearance in Jingmen Island must be related to our family’s upcoming plan that is about to be implemented.”</p><p>“Tang Xiu?” Yao Chengqing’s voice brought a doubtful tone. “Which Tang Xiu are you talking about?”</p><p>“It’s the Tang Xiu from the Tang Family,” said Yao Xinhua.</p><p>Yao Chengqing fell into silence for a while. As if suddenly recalling something, he suddenly spoke in a heavy tone, “The Tang Xiu whom you competed against in the Southern region? The brat who was missing from the Tang Family for 20 years?”</p><p>“Yes, it’s him!” Said Yao Xinhua.</p><p>Yao Chengqing was silent for a moment, and then said in a grim and cold tone, “There must be no mistakes in implementing the plan this time. Although you’re there just to smooth things over, you’d better avoid trouble. With a member of the Tang Family suddenly appearing in Jingmen Island, that means they have noticed something already. In this case, find a chance to make this Tang Xiu stay in Jingmen Island forever.”</p><p>“I understand, Dad.” Yao Xinhua’s face moved. “He’ll meet his maker for sure, and it will be carried out silently.”</p><p>“Don’t take it lightly. He’s in the shadows and you’re in the light, so take your own security as the first priority,” said Yao Chengqing. “If it doesn’t go well, then retreat at once. I believe your uncle will be able to do it very secretively.”</p><p>“Don’t worry. I know what I’m capable of,” said Yao Xinhua. “I won’t take the initiative to strike without 100% certainty. I’ll immediately retreat should the slightest sign of trouble arise.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
