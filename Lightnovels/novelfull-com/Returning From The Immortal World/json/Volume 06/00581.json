According to the prescription made by Tang Xiu back then, there were a total of 88 kinds of precious herbs. Tang Xiu opened one of the suitcases and examined the properties and age of the herbs before he stored the suitcases inside his interspatial ring one by one. A regretful look appeared on his face after he put away all the suitcases.</p><p>These rare herbs collected by Li Juren were required to refine the Marrow Purifying Pill and were definitely enough to concoct more than 100 Marrow Purifying Pills. Although the rare herbs required to refine the Life Essence Pill had also been collected, among the three most important herbs needed, only the five-hundred years old Fleece-Flower Root had been collected; the Blood Droplet Seed and the Millennium Snow Lotus were still missing.</p><p>“According to the ratio to concoct the Marrow Purifying Pill, these herbs sent by Li Juren would be enough to produce hundreds of Life Essence Pills. Unfortunately, the Millennium Snow Lotus and Blood Droplet Seed were not collected. I’m afraid that refining the Life Essence Pill will be very difficult.”</p><p>Tang Xiu suppressed his regret. He knew that a man must not be greedy, and getting a lot of medicinal herbs to refine the Marrow Purifying Pill and Life Essence Pill was already a big harvest. The Millennium Snow Lotus and Blood Droplet Seed were medicinal herbs that were something that may come by with luck and couldn’t be sought. Tang Xiu himself had actually obtained the Millennium Snow Lotus before, but it had been used by Ji Chimei to refine a medicine pill already.</p><p>Haste will only make waste! Tang Xiu knew perfectly well about this truth. He then turned his head to look at Chi Nan after closing the container truck’s door. There was surprised look on her face.</p><p>“You will also have your own interspatial ring in the future if you can reach a level I’m satisfied with. All right, I have other things to tend to, so I’ll go back.”</p><p>After dropping these words, Tang Xiu then headed to his car and drove away.</p><p>While watching the leaving car quietly, Chi Nan’s face was full of anticipation. She wished to have a lot of cultivation resources and more so own her own interspatial ring. There was one thing she realized. If she owned an interspatial ring, it would be much easier to do things regardless of whatever she did and wherever she went.</p><p>“The most important priority for me now is getting money.” Chi Nan clenched her fist with a firm expression.</p><p>Twelve in the dead of the night.</p><p>As Tang Xiu arrived back at the Bluestar Villa Complex, he found that Kang Xia was not resting in his bedroom, but sat quietly on the bed while reading financial statements instead. The newly listed healthcare products had produced very good results, and the returned capital also made the financial situation of the Magnificent Tang Corporation ampler.</p><p>However, she also knew that Tang Xiu had a big plan. In particular, the internal purchase of the Star City’s New City, the construction of the company headquarters in Shanghai along with its relocation, the construction of the plants and factories along with the equipment that came in line with them, and so on, all of which could be put simply that there were many places of the money to be allocated to.</p><p>“You’re not asleep yet?” Asked Tang Xiu with a smile after taking off his coat and hanging it.</p><p>Kang Xia closed the financial statements report and chuckled, “Ah, you’ve come back. Anyways, I’m preparing to return to Star City tomorrow, and there’s already a big pile of issues waiting for me to address there.”</p><p>“Have you reserved the flight ticket?” Asked Tang Xiu. “I’ll drive you over to the airport.”</p><p>“I already booked the flight!” Kang Xia still replied softly despite feeling unwilling inside.</p><p>This night, the two fell into a frenzied state, pressing against each other, and then falling asleep while embracing each other after the desperate fight.</p><p>In the next morning, Tang Xiu sent Kang Xia to the Shanghai Airport and then returned to Bluestar Villa Complex. On the way there, Tang Xiu received a call from Yang Le. Back then, he dragged him to Jingmen Island since he needed him to deal with some matters. Since the matter was relatively easy to resolve whereas the matter with the Tang Family took more time, Yang Le thus had nothing to do and spent some time in Jingmen Island before returning to Shanghai with Han Qingwu.</p><p>After returning home and entering the living room, Tang Xiu saw Yang Le and Dai Xinyue looking at each other in consternation. He let out a faint smile and said, “You two should already be acquainted with each other, right?”</p><p>“No, we aren’t!”</p><p>Dai Xinyue and Yang Le spoke in unison. The two immediately glared at each other and flung their faces at the same time.</p><p>Tang Xiu was stumped for words. He couldn’t help but force a smile and ask, “What’s wrong? Is there some misunderstanding or something between the two of you?”</p><p>Dai Xinyue stood up and said, “Master, this guy is a scumbag, he…”</p><p>“Don’t listen to this girl’s gibberish, Tang Xiu! It’s just a misunderstanding, really!” Yang Le also hastily got up and exasperatedly said. “Who would have known that she was relieving herself in the toilet? I was a bit hurried to answer the call of nature when I came to your place here… so I just…”</p><p>Tang Xiu was instantly aware of the matter and laughed, “Okay, okay. It’s a misunderstanding and since you two have said it, then forget it. Anyways, Yang Le, you called me and said that there are important things so you needed to find me. What is it, exactly?”</p><p>“Brother Tang, tell her to leave. I don’t trust this girl.” Yang Le pointed to Dai Xinyue.</p><p>Again, Tang Xiu was stumped for words.</p><p>“Who the hell cares about you, huh?” Dai Xinyue snappily glared at Yang Le and scornfully said, “Master, I’m going out with Auntie Zhang to buy some groceries. Do you have anything you need to buy?”</p><p>“No.” Tang Xiu shook his head.</p><p>As Dai Xinyue and the housekeeper Zhang Xinlan left, Yang Le came to Tang Xiu’s side and spoke in a low voice, “My Eldest Senior Brother has returned to China and is now in Shanghai.”</p><p>“Yao Qinglong?” Tang Xiu’s brows creased as he asked.</p><p>“Yeah, it’s him.” Yang Le nodded. “I just received his summons, saying that he has come to Shanghai and wants to meet with me.”</p><p>“The Yao Family is almost finished, and the rest of their members who escaped death by a hairbreadth have also left Beijing hurriedly to hide through various means. For Yao Qinglong to come to Shanghai and not appear in Beijing, what does he want to do?”</p><p>“I’m also curious about that.” Yang Le shook his head. “Therefore, I didn’t flatly refuse him after he contacted me and came to find you to discuss it. I always had a nagging feeling that he’s up to no good given that he looked for me all of a sudden like this.”</p><p>“Go see him and find out what his real intention is.” Tang Xiu pondered for a moment and seriously said, “I remember you saying he’s very ambitious. Considering he has been abroad for so many years, no one knows how big his energy at present. Though I’m not afraid of him, I fear troublesome matters. He’s a risky variable, thus I must employ every possible means to remove him.”</p><p>After hesitating for a moment, Yang Le replied in a low voice, “If… if he really wants to be your enemy, can you promise me one thing?”</p><p>“Tell me!” Said Tang Xiu calmly.</p><p>“Though when all is said and done, he’s still my Eldest Senior Brother. Can you spare him at the last moment?” Asked Yang Le.</p><p>Tang Xiu answered, “Sparing his life is not out of the possibility. You tell me, do you think it’s better to make him a living dead? Or do you want him to meet his demise early and be reincarnated earlier?”</p><p>“This…” Yang Le was silent for a while, before he reluctantly nodded and said, “Treat it as I didn’t say anything, then. I’ll help you figure out the true purpose of his return to the country, whereas you’ll solve the problem yourself. I’m afraid that I must go abroad tomorrow and will only come back after some time.”</p><p>“Copy that!” Tang Xiu nodded. He knew Yang Le’s character. He was sandwiched between him and his Eldest Senior Brother, and it was very hard for him to act. The reason for his trip abroad was probably to avoid suspicion.</p><p>****</p><p>At noon, Yang Le met his Eldest Senior Brother—Yao Qinglong in a café. What made him surprised was that Yao Qinglong not only not felt pained due to what happened to the Yao Family, but looked overjoyed instead, even the smiling expression on his face was very rich.</p><p>“What exactly do you want from me?”</p><p>Yang Le sat on the chair across him wearing his ever present frivolous appearance.</p><p>“What do you wanna drink?” Asked Yao Qinglong with a smile.</p><p>“Seeing you makes me don’t have the taste to drink anything.” Yang Le waved his hand. “If you want fart then burst it out quickly, don’t waste my time.”</p><p>Yao Qinglong seemed accustomed to Yang Le’s attitude and only smiling lightly in response. “Junior Brother, though Master has passed away, we’re still martial bothers after all. I just wanted to see you and talk about the old days. This should be ok, no?”</p><p>“You’re a cunning schemer, and you think what you can get from others.” Yang Le spoke with a despising expression. “I’m afraid that you and I have fallen short of treating each other like that. Now, are you gonna spit it out or not? If you won’t, then I’ll leave.”</p><p>“Alright, still throwing tantrums eh, brat. I’m already accustomed to it. OK, OK, then I’ll tell you something important. I got a business deal that I need your help with. I’ll give you a commission of 100 million after the deal is successful.”</p><p>“100 million, eh? What a great deal!” Yang Le revealed a surprised look, as his eyes searched Yao Qinglong.</p><p>“It is a big deal, indeed. Some people have paid quite a high price for the formulas of several products of the Magnificent Tang Corporation. Many people are paying attention to this company and many already attacked it, and yet all of them eventually ended up in failure. I took over the deal, so I came to Shanghai directly to find you after returning to the country. Moreover, Second and Third have already agreed and are now on the way to Shanghai as well.”</p><p>The Magnificent Tang Corporation?</p><p>Yang secretly sighed inwardly and somewhat felt contempt as well as sympathized with Yao Qinglong. What he despised was that Yao Qinglong actually didn’t bother and ignore the kinship affection even though the members of his Yao Family had partly dispersed and partly died with their lives hung by a thread at present, whereas the sympathy he had for him was because he was targeting the Magnificent Tang Corporation. Others didn’t know the details about this company, but he was crystal clear about it. With those fearful stratagems Tang Xiu possessed as well as those non-human guys from the Everlasting Feast Hall, Yao Qinglong and the other disciples of the Thief Branch would never have their wishes come true!</p><p>Yang Le fell into silence for a while, before he slowly said, “I have a problem. Are you a member of the Yao Family? According to the news I heard, the Yao Family is in a disastrous state and their people are kinda falling from the clouds, as many of them are in peril and danger. You are a member of the Yao Family, yet you don’t even seem to care about them?”</p><p>Yao Qinglong’s eyes squinted. A killing intent flickered in his eyes as he indifferently said, “This big enmity must be avenged, that’s for sure. But how much do you think the odds of me winning are? I know what you are implying; you think that I have a cold heart, right? Hmph… 10 years are never too long for a man to take his revenge. The weak me paying off old scores with a very strong hated enemy is akin to pitting a rock against a boulder—it will only cause my own destruction. Ultimately, not only revenge will be an impossibility, I’ll even throw myself onto the gallows instead.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
