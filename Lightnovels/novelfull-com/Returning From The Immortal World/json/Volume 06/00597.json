You can be said as the biggest silk pants figure in the capital. But think clearly what kind of fate awaits you if you openly attack this important institution of the country. The Zhao Family may be very powerful, but they can’t afford being suppressed by the state just for you alone. Put your gun down and leave with your men!”</p><p>Zhao Yundi quickly released the safety lock and pulled the trigger.</p><p>BANG!</p><p>As the gun was fired, the bullet left the dark muzzle and was aimed at Wei Xiqing’s forehead. Tang Xiu, who stood at the side, instantly furrowed his brows and waved his hand. The bullet was then caught between his index and middle finger, preventing a disaster from befalling Wei Xiqing.</p><p>Prior to this, Tang Xiu disliked Zhao Yundi’s silk pants attitude, but now he really was disgusted by him; resorting to murder by relying on the power of his family, an action that Tang Xiu truly looked down upon. If he himself was very capable, he could resort to murder if he so wished to, without relying on the protection of his family. But his action now simply courted disaster for himself and directed a calamity upon his own family.</p><p>“What a moron!” A cold humming voice came from Tang Xiu’s mouth.</p><p>The bullet was gone, this was something Zhao Yundi didn’t expect. His eyes then fell on the bullet clamped between Tang Xiu’s fingers. Disbelief instantly appeared on his face. It was like in a movie when the main character caught a bullet between his fingers. But how could someone possibly do it in reality?</p><p>Was he… was he dreaming?</p><p>Wei Xiqing was also paralyzed since he never imagined that Zhao Yundi would actually dare to shoot him. He looked at the bullet between Tang Xiu’s fingers, and his dry throat wriggled a few times, whereas Zhang Lei next to him already had his gun aimed at Zhao Yundi the moment the fella fired his gun. If it wasn’t for Tang Xiu moving to block Zhao Yundi, he might have shot and killed him already.</p><p>What exactly happened? How did the gun aimed at the Director have no bullets? Was Zhao Yundi’s gun a fake?</p><p>Zhang Lei took two steps forward as his heartbeat hiked up and his face was full of shock upon seeing the object between Tang Xiu’s fingers. Catching a bullet empty-handedly? Were his eyes shrouded by an illusion, or was he dreaming?</p><p>At this time, the rest of the people beside them were also shocked by Tang Xiu’s act. Their faces were all painted by disbelief, as some of them even rubbed their eyes, trying to make sure that they weren’t seeing an illusion. Eventually, everyone finally snapped back to their senses and realized that they were not imagining things, this was truly real!</p><p>After letting out a curse and catching the bullet, Tang Xiu seized the pistol in Zhao Yundi’s hand. He coldly snorted and said, “All the Great Silk Pants of the Capital turn out to be nothing but morons who only know how to flaunt and act brave. If it wasn’t for the shelter provided by your Zhao Family all this time, I don’t know how many times you would have died given your revolting behavior. Don’t bother someone else if you wanna play, for I’ll accompany you playing. I really don’t believe that your Zhao Family is much stronger than the Yao Family.”</p><p>Zhao Yundi was stunned. He never dreamed that Tang Xiu was actually aiming his spearhead at him. He still hadn’t figured out Tang Xiu’s identity until now, but when he recalled the time he arrived here when even Zhang Lei was pointing his gun at Tang Xiu, he was immediately furious. He thought that Tang Xiu only had a good aunt for being able to make a phone call to the Director of the Virus Research Institute.</p><p>“Fucking idiot! Asshole! You’re asking for…”</p><p>Pa…</p><p>Tang Xiu slapped his face. Just as those twenty stocky men were about to rush forward, Zhang Lei led his security team members to the front and the situation remained in a stalemate.</p><p>“You all, he…”</p><p>Pa…</p><p>Yet again, Tang Xiu used his hand again to slap Zhao Yundi’s face.</p><p>Each time Zhao Yundi opened his mouth to shout, the number of slaps he got from Tang Xiu increased. He desperately wanted to fight back, yet was constantly slapped by Tang Xiu. It wasn’t until he got slapped for more than a dozen times that he nearly lost his sanity due to anger, as he exerted all his strength and tried to command his men to attack. Unfortunately, time was not enough for him to shout as more slaps came down to his face.</p><p>Bam…</p><p>Tang Xiu’s slaps were so fierce that he slumped down on his butt. He no longer dared to speak and could only shoot Tang Xiu a murderous glare, wishing that he could pull out his tendons, hack his bones, and scatter his ashes.</p><p>Tang Xiu intentionally raised his hand again and sneered, “I didn’t actually feel like thrashing you, but your Zhao Family has a good relationship with my Tang Family, so I can only rescue you this time. But do not think there will never be a second time. If you still don’t know how to act properly, and when to advance and retreat, I don’t mind killing you myself so as to avoid a disaster to befall upon the Zhao Family.”</p><p>Having said that, he looked at Wei Xiqing and said, “Director Wei, saving people is like fighting fire. I hope you don’t stoop down to his level since he’s nothing but a brat spoiled by his family. Just consider the bullet before as the price to write off the account. What do you think?”</p><p>After looking at Tang Xiu in silence, Wei Xiqing finally sighed inwardly and said, “Properly speaking, I should pursue this matter because he was the one who shot me. But I’ll let this matter go on the account of your face. But if he dares to make trouble again, I’m ready for everything to drag him with me to see the King of Hell together!”</p><p>Tang Xiu nodded at him in response. He then kicked Zhao Yundi and sternly shouted, “What the hell are you gawking here for? Scram!”</p><p>Zhao Yundi was afraid that Tang Xiu would hit him again, but then recalled his purpose of coming here and yelled back, “NO, I WON’T LEAVE! My sister is infected and is still inside. I can’t watch her die helplessly here. Just kill me if you got the balls!”</p><p>After being silent for a moment, Tang Xiu suddenly looked at those men brought by Zhao Yundi and spoke to them in a deep voice, “I don’t give a damn if you all are private forces of the Zhao Family, neither do I care about who you are. Put down your guns if you don’t want to court trouble for Zhao Yundi and SCRAM! Hmph… he’s just a little brat, but all of you are not! You should know how grave the consequences you will face for today’s actions.”</p><p>The twenty stocky men exchanged dismayed looks. How could they not realize the gravity of situation? Yet, they had to obey Zhao Yundi’s orders, thus they could only brace themselves and go with the tide. Instantly, all of them looked at Zhao Yundi and waited for his decision.</p><p>A cloudy and yet hesitant expression could be seen on Zhao Yundi’s face. He hesitated for more than half a minute before getting up from the ground and waving his hand, “All of you go back.”</p><p>Quickly, those twenty sturdy men left.</p><p>Following that, Zhao Yundi shot Tang Xiu a look. Though there was still anger on his face, he forcefully held himself back and shouted, “I already ordered them to leave, but I must still go inside since I must take my sister from this place here and now. I will never leave this place without her!”</p><p>Feeling too lazy to pay attention to him, Tang Xiu turned his head and looked at Wei Xiqing, saying, “Let us go inside! Saving people is all that matters.”</p><p>Wei Xiqing nodded quickly in response and took Tang Xiu and Chen Tong, whose face was full of awe. They quickly entered the institute and finally arrived at the quarantine area of the institute seven-plus minutes later.</p><p>“Divine Doctor Tang, according to the investigation from the intelligence agency, there have been a total 329 people who had close contact with those infected, and more than 60 have already contracted high fever symptoms and are confirmed to have been infected. We also have assigned a lot of experts across the country, but it’s a pity that we haven’t yet been able to figure out the origin of the virus as well as finding a solution as for how to treat the infected,” briefly explained Wei Shiqing.</p><p>Tang Xiu looked at Chen Tong and asked, “What’s the name of your classmate?”</p><p>“It’s Zhao Tingting,” answered Chen Tong quickly.</p><p>“Take me to this girl called Zhao Tingting!” Tang Xiu spoke to Wei Xiqing. “She’s the first virus carrier to appear and perhaps the key is with her.”</p><p>“I’m coming too!” Shouted Zhao Yundi immediately.</p><p>“What can you do?” Tang Xiu knitted his brows and coldly said. “Just wait outside.”</p><p>“Zhao Tingting is my sister, so I naturally must go with you,” exclaimed Zhao Yundi loudly.</p><p>His revelation made Tang Xiu stare blankly, and Chen Tong’s face was full of disbelief. He and Zhao Tingting were classmates and both were studied at the same university abroad. It was then that they fell in love with each other and became lovers, it’s just that their relationship hadn’t yet been officially recognized by their families. The reason why he followed Zhao Tingting to Beijing this time was also to meet her family.</p><p>He rarely heard Zhao Tinting mentioning her family and thought that she just hailed and grown up from a wealthy family. Little did he expect that she turned out to be a descendant of the Zhao Family from Beijing.</p><p>“I don’t care who Zhao Tingting is,” said Tang Xiu indifferently. “She’s now a carrier of the virus and no one is allowed to see her except me. So, be obedient and wait outside.”</p><p>“You…” Zhao Yundi was seething in anger.</p><p>Tang Xiu raised his hand, scaring him out of his wits as he stepped back a few steps.</p><p>Two minutes later, Tang Xiu passed through several iron gates and walked in the corridor with a staff member wearing a biohazard protective suit. Through transparent windows, he saw that each room was occupied by two people and they looked chagrined and despaired.</p><p>In the deepest place within the quarantine area, the beautiful Zhao Tingting hugged her knees while leaning on the bed in the corner. Her complexion was painted with unusual redness and her lips were slightly purple. She stared blankly and was in a daze with slightly furrowed brows.</p><p>Ding…</p><p>The door to the isolation room was opened as Tang Xiu entered, whereas the staff member in his biohazard protective suit closed the door from the outside.</p><p>“You…” Zhao Tingting slowly raised her and looked surprised.</p><p>“Are you Zhao Tingting, Chen Tong’s classmate?” Asked Tang Xiu with a smile.</p><p>She nodded in response. As if realizing something, she abruptly got up from the bed, went to the corner and shouted, “Don’t come near me! Who let you inside. I… I have been infected by a virus. Get out quickly!”</p><p>“What good morals and character,” praised Tang Xiu. “Your own safety isn’t yet guaranteed, but you still keep thinking about others. That’s very great of you, barely qualified as a wife to be of my grand-disciple.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
