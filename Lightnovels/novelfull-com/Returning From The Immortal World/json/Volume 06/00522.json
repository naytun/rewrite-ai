He heard Yue Kai saying that he had seen a woman whose beauty was flawless in Tang Xiu’s home. He thought that Yue Kai was lying, and it was all a bull he made up. But at this time, Hu Qingsong finally believed it. The looks and figure of this girl were definitely not under the first campus flower of Shanghai University, Mu Wanying, as well as similarly on par with the super celebrity, Zhang Xinya.</p><p>He would definitely choose this girl over Mu Wanying and Zhang Xinya if he ever had the chance to pick one among the three. It was because this girl gave off a very cool vibe and fiery personality, which were the types he liked the most.</p><p>“B-Big… Big Bro Tang, is she also your woman?” Asked Hu Qingsong. His eyes looked dull.</p><p>Tang Xiu had yet to reply when Ouyang Lulu reacted. She knitted her brows and asked, “What did you just say? Also?!! Who else is Tang Xiu’s woman beside me?”</p><p>“Ah…” Hu Qingsong was taken aback. Little did he expect that his slip of tongue would push Tang Xiu into the pit of hell.</p><p>Tang Xiu shook his head and smiled. He grabbed Lulu’s wrist and strided out of the villa, and then spoke to her, “Lulu, don’t listen to Hu Qingsong’s gibberish. I’m always clean, far from that thing called love before I graduate from university. There has never been other women at all.”</p><p>After hearing this, Hu Qingsong immediately felt relieved. He caught up and repeatedly nodded as he said, “Yeah, that’s right. Big Bro Tang definitely has no other women. Though there are indeed other women chasing him, who is Eldest Bro Tang? Of course, there may be myriad flowers, but only the leaf will never leave its body! Ugh, isn’t that right, Big Bro Tang?”</p><p>“What the f*ck!” Ouyang Lulu snapped. “So, I’m the leaf, huh?”</p><p>Hu Qingsong was stumped.</p><p>Tang Xiu was similarly speechless. He shook his head and said, “You two wait for me here. I need to go upstairs to change clothes, and then we’ll go out for lunch.”</p><p>Twenty minutes later, the trio left the villa complex and headed to the Everlasting Feast Hall by car. When the trio entered the restaurant, Tang Xiu saw Han Qingwu merrily chatting with Chi Nan at the front counter.</p><p>“Tang Xiu, it’s your class’ teacher-in-charge,” whispered Lulu while touching Tang Xiu’s arm.</p><p>Tang Xiu nodded silently. He immediately knitted his brows after seeing Han Qingwu and Chi Nan looking in his direction and walking toward him. However, he bitterly smiled inwardly when he recalled Han Qingwu’s status in Shanghai University. He had thought through about this issue before. He would have to behave well if he wanted to stay in Shanghai University. If he continued treating Han Qingwu with a detached attitude and repel her, it would probably court a lot more troubles for him, even becoming a problem for him if he asked for a leave later.</p><p>“Teacher Han, what a coincidence!” Hu Qingsong was the first to open his mouth and smilingly spoke.</p><p>Han Qingwu nodded at him with a smile. Her eyes then fell on Tang Xiu before glancing at Ouyang Lulu and asking, “Tang Xiu, why didn’t you come to report to the campus this morning?”</p><p>“I got delayed with some matters and just arrived from Beijing,” answered Tang Xiu.</p><p>Han Qingwu’s eyes swept across him, as she turned to Chi Nan and said, “Manager Chi, I still have some matters to handle, so I’ll take my leave first. Remember to tell your Big Boss to never skip classes again later.”</p><p>“All right!” Replied Chi Nan with a nod while restraining her smile.</p><p>Following that, Tang Xiu’s gaze followed Han Qingwu as she turned around to leave. He then shook his head and shifted his eyes to Chi Nan, asking, “Why is she here?”</p><p>“She came to dine, Boss. Besides, we are a restaurant open for business. Are you saying we must keep her out?” Asked Chi Nan with a smile.</p><p>“Ugh…” Tang Xiu was dumbfounded and was left without argument.</p><p>“Manager Chi, you might as well keep off those women who are scheming to pursue your Boss,” said Ouyang Lulu.</p><p>“Do I have to keep Miss Ouyang out as well?” Asked Chi Nan with a grin.</p><p>“AH…” Ouyang Lulu stared blankly and fell into a daze. She then immediately waved her hand and said, “That’s different. I’m aboveboard and straightforward in my pursuit, while Han Qingwu is conspiring in secret. In the future, I’ll become the Lady Boss of the Everlasting Feast Hall; she can’t be compared with me.”</p><p>Chi Nan couldn’t help but laugh. But after she glanced at Tang Xiu, she quickly restrained herself and hastily asked, “Are you gonna dine, Boss? I’ll immediately arrange it.”</p><p>Tang Xiu could only sigh helplessly. He was really at wits end upon facing Lulu’s open, brazen, thick-skinned, and unconstrained pursuit. He had already warned her many times and nothing worked, hence he was too lazy to waste his saliva anymore.</p><p>At the side, Hu Qingsong watched Tang Xiu and Chi Nan in a dumbfounded and tongue-tied manner. His mouth gaped so wide that even a big goose egg could enter it. The disbelieving expression on his face was the expression of shock inside his heart.</p><p>“What are you dazing and gaping for? Let’s go inside!”</p><p>Tang Xiu had just walked for a few steps before he turned to look at Hu Qingsong, who was nailed in his spot motionlessly, and called out to him.</p><p>Finally, Hu Qingsong closed his mouth. But after he caught up, he asked in a rough voice, “B-Big… Big Bro Tang, Manager Chi just said… what did she say? Boss? Are you the owner of this Everlasting Feast Hall?”</p><p>It is true that paper cannot contain fire! Now that this fact was known by Hu Qingsong, he didn’t feel like hiding it anymore, thus he nodded and replied, “Yeah, I’m the owner of this Everlasting Feast Hall. I didn’t tell you before because I didn’t want you to think about it. Since you know about this now, don’t sell me out to anyone, got it?”</p><p>Hu Qingsong swallowed the water in his mouth and nodded with a wooden expression.</p><p>At this moment, no words were able to describe what he felt inside. Because even in his wildest dream, he never expected that his fellow student who shared a dormitory with him was actually the owner of the Everlasting Feast Hall. He knew that the Everlasting Feast Hall was one of the top restaurants in the entire Shanghai, and even its annual net income exceeded nine digits.</p><p>What did nine digits meant? It was in the billion range!</p><p>With billions of yuan of annual income, didn’t it explain that Tang Xiu was also a super mega rich person?</p><p>At the corner of the first floor, Tang Xiu casually picked a place for them to sit down. There was no need for him to pick the deluxe box upstairs since he was only dining here with Ouyang Lulu and Hu Qingsong. He could only sigh inwardly upon seeing Lulu naturally taking the seat next to him, with a matter-of-fact attitude, as he pointed the seat across to him and spoke to Hu Qingsong, “Don’t gawk and daze again, will you? Get a move on and take a seat!”</p><p>After sitting, Hu Qingsong cautiously asked, “Big Bro Tang, can you tell me how much money do you have, exactly?”</p><p>“I haven’t really counted how much money I have, to be honest,” said Tang Xiu with a smile. “If you ask me, money is nothing but only a series of numbers. Hence, I don’t feel like putting much thought into something that has no significant meaning.”</p><p>“…”</p><p>While looking like a silly fool at Tang Xiu, Hu Qingsong’s outlook toward the world was collapsing as his heart was struck with a thunderous idea.</p><p>It was out of the norm!</p><p>A strong and concentrated pressuring aura as though a tide, Tang Xiu at this moment was seemingly enveloped by a golden light. Hu Qingsong’s eyes were as though a donkey’s, yet they were still stabbed and pained. It was the kind of envy and jealousy of ordinary people, yet it was still unable to express even a shred of a millionth of his mood.</p><p>Being unable to count the number on his bank card with his fingers was one of Hu Qingsong’s dreams. As he was now, he was just a poor peasant who went out with nothing but dry food in his pocket. While he must thicken his face to ask his parents to support him, Tang Xiu was unexpectedly telling him that money was just a series of numbers in his eyes, even to the extent that it had no significant point whatsoever… That made his strong heart nearly collapse.</p><p>What kind of people say that money was nothing but a series of numbers?</p><p>Wasn’t this remark only the likes of those super-rich people with a colossal amount of wealth could speak? Could it be that Tang Xiu was on the level of those super-rich people now?</p><p>****</p><p>An employee of the Everlasting Feast Hall delivered and served the fragrant dishes. As of now, Tang Xiu’s identity was known to nearly all Everlasting Feast Hall’s employees, so they were displaying an unusually good performance in front of him.</p><p>The dishes consisted of four spicy non-vegetarian dishes, two veggie soups, and one medication diet. The smell, looks, and taste was just great.</p><p>After Tang Xiu began eating, Hu Qingsong was as though just awakening from a dream, and broke free from his complex emotions. He didn’t hurry to eat, however, and just looked at Tang Xiu as he asked, “Eldest Brother Tang, are you willing to support me in the future? I’ll work hard in any work you assign me.”</p><p>“Would you like to be a Chef apprentice at this Everlasting Feast Hall?” Asked Tang Xiu with a smile.</p><p>“I’m sure you must have more than this Everlasting Feast Hall,” said Hu Qingsong.</p><p>“What makes you think so?” Tang Xiu raised his brows and smilingly asked.</p><p>“Because you will never say that money is nothing but a series of numbers if you only have this Everlasting Feast Hall. Even if this restaurant does make money, the amount it can make is limited,” said Hu Qingsong seriously.</p><p>“Well, the HQ of the Everlasting Feast Hall is in Jingmen Island, while it also has franchising branches in Hong Kong, Shanghai, and Beijing. Do you think I still have other businesses now?” Explained Tang Xiu.</p><p>Hu Qingsong dazed for a moment. After contemplating for a moment, he still shook his head and said, “That’s still not enough.”</p><p>“Anyways, the normal you usually have a rough personality, careless and casual; the stereotype of Northeasterner. Yet, you are somewhat refined in your rough way, and outstandingly astute as well. But then, doesn’t your family have businesses to manage, too?  Aren’t you going back home to manage your family’s business after you graduate from university?”</p><p>“My family can only be regarded as an upstart. My father is still healthy and is stronger than I am, whereas each of my family members at home are just like ferocious tigers and wolves, with their eyes staring at the family businesses. Going back home and fighting it over with them doesn’t interest me at all,” said Hu Qingsong with a forced, bitter smile.</p><p>“I can help you set up a business,” said Tang Xiu with a smile.</p><p>“Can I earn more than you if you invest in my business?” Asked Hu Qingsong back.</p><p>Tang Xiu was silent for a moment. The smile on his face was replaced with seriousness, as his fingers tapped on the table and said, “Don’t you think it’s a bit early to say that now?”</p><p>“Do you really think that it’s too early?” Asked Hu Qingsong once again.</p><p>Giving him a defeated look, Tang Xiu helplessly said, “Since you have said it yourself, then you can work for me later. We’ll talk about the details later. Furthermore, Xue Chao is honest and good-natured, so I’m also going to let him help me.”</p><p>“You haven’t told me, what other businesses do you have besides this Everlasting Feast Hall?” Asked Hu Qingsong hurriedly.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
