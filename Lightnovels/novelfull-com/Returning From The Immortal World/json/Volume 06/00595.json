He recalled the incidents back in 2002 as many people were isolated and met their death due to SARS. As things stand at present, many people in China had a deep-rooted fear of infectious diseases, and what happened before was a perfect example as the plagues that occurred in the past killed many people each time they broke out.</p><p>“As a grand-disciple of mine, you must have enough courage, Chen Tong. Your Dad is a real man, thus his son must not be a good-for-nothing. Trust me, I’ll guarantee that you’ll be safe.”</p><p>Chen Tong hesitated for a moment before he nodded and said, “I believe you since you’re the one who’s saying this, Grand Master. Let’s go, my car is parked outside.”</p><p>Tang Xiu nodded with satisfaction. Despite being young, Chen Tong, who seemed to be a year or two younger than him, had such a rare courage. And in particular… he especially trusted him.</p><p>****</p><p>The National Virus Research Institute was located in the remote Southeast Suburb of Beijing. The site had a large chemical plant on the surface, but the interior was a very strictly guarded virus research center. Two kilometers away from the site police officers in casual clothes were seen patrolling the vicinity, whereas there were also guard posts in the interior that were particularly tightly arranged.</p><p>Zhang Lei was a security team captain of the National Virus Research Institute and once an outstanding special ops soldier with remarkable military exploits. He was assigned to the security work of this site after finishing his major in the university.</p><p>Standing in front of the gate of the outermost level, a worried expression appeared in Zhang Lei’s eyes. It was because a terrifying new type of virus had emerged and there had been a widespread virus outbreak as well. The entire Research Institute was now packed with a heavy atmosphere. He was well aware of the fact that the container truck that came in from the outside brought people who had been infected with the virus or had close contact with the infected.</p><p>“There’s another car outside requesting to be admitted to the hospital.” The voice of his security colleague was transmitted through the communicator on his waist.</p><p>“Check their documents and inspect the car, whether they have dangerous objects in there.” Zhang Lei replied in a sinking voice. “Proceed according to the previous examination method and do a comprehensive inspection. And remember to not come in contact with the people inside the car and wear a gas mask at all times!”</p><p>“Understood!” A reply came from the communicator.</p><p>Taking a deep sight, Zhang Lei suddenly had the urge to smoke, but the rules of the Virus Research Institute forbade smoking at a two kilometers minimum from the outermost gate. After contemplating for a moment, he decided to go outside to survey the situation and smoke a cigarette to ease his depression.</p><p>A few minutes later, as he was driving through the first blockade line about two kilometers away, the container truck had just finished being inspected and was allowed in.</p><p>“Captain!”</p><p>More than a dozen security guards wearing black security uniforms saluted him.</p><p>After returning the salute, Zhang Lei took out a cigarette from his pocket, ignited it and took two deep puffs. He then threw the rest of the pack to the others and asked in a deep voice, “Was that the first truck today?”</p><p>“It was the fourth truck!” Replied one of the security guards.</p><p>Zhang Lei secretly sighed inwardly and let out a wry smile, “The quarantine area inside is probably not enough. There should be 300 people who have already been sent here, right?”</p><p>The security guard nodded, “It should be 329 people, precisely, according to the data recorded. I’m afraid that the first patient won’t be able to hold much longer if the experts in the research institute fail to study the antiviral medication for the virus. Also, Old Zhang, who is responsible for the meals delivery, said that the number of infected patients who have high fever has increased to 62, and some of them are in grave condition.”</p><p>Zhang Lei didn’t speak. Though he didn’t want to encounter such a scene, he was nothing but a security member; he didn’t have the power to pull against the surging tide.</p><p>Honk, honk…</p><p>A white BMW 525 sedan slowly stopped in front of everyone.</p><p>Zhang Lei pinched the cigarette and threw it into a trash can nearby. He then walked toward the white BMW 525 sedan and spoke, “Hello, comrade. Please show me your documents.”</p><p>The window opened as Chen Tong spoke, “I’m Chen Tong, I must go inside, and we have no documents to show either.”</p><p>Zhang Lei’s face was blank. He then seemingly recalled something as he pulled out his pistol and aimed its black muzzle at Chen Tong. At the same time, he quickly stepped four or five steps back and shouted, “GET OUT OF THE CAR AND ACCEPT THE INSPECTION!!!”</p><p>Chen Tong turned to look Tang Xiu on the front passenger seat.</p><p>Tang Xiu patted his shoulder before getting off the car and walking towards Zhang Lei. He then stopped a few meters away from him and lightly said, “I’m Tang Xiu, a certified Chinese Medical doctor. I need to go to the Virus Research Institute to have a look at the situation. I hope you can contact the director of the institute and report to him about me if this is out of your jurisdiction.”</p><p>Zhang Lei was silent for a moment before taking out his communicator and reporting to his superior, “Director Wei, a young man named Tang Xiu says he possesses a certificate of Chinese Medical science and wants to enter the institute. In addition, he brought someone with him, the wanted Chen Tong.”</p><p>“Tang Xiu? Chinese Medical science? Where the hell did this reckless impostor come from? Forget it, he still must be inspected if he wants to enter the institute, whoever he may be. He may have gotten infected since he came with that boy. Immediately apprehend them and personally escort them into our custody.” Director Wei’s voice was heard from the communicator.</p><p>Zhang Lei’s expression changed and straightly pointed his gun at Tang Xiu after complying with the order, saying, “Comrade, please cooperate with us. Our superior has already instructed that you must be inspected and escorted into our custody!”</p><p>Tang Xiu squinted his eyes, as a cold light suffused within.</p><p>Escorted into custody?!</p><p>There were many meanings in the statement “escorted to custody”, yet it had a whole different meaning in this situation. He was not a suspect, but a doctor who came offering help. He also showed his identity as a Chinese Medical doctor, yet the other party was unexpectedly so rude, making him very angry.</p><p>VROOM…</p><p>During the stalemate, the roar of an engine came from a distance as a dozen black SUVs came speeding fast like uncontrollable threatening wild horses, as they headed toward them. A young man who seemed to be in his 26 or 27, biting a toothpick, with his ears pricked by dozens of earrings, and hair bleached with every color under the sun came down along with the orderly opening of doors.</p><p>However, when he saw the scene before his eyes, he suddenly furrowed his brows and shouted, “Hey, a good dog never obstructs the road. Get lost to the side! Hey you, the fella with the gun, do you know who this young master is? Get the fucking lost, or I’ll break your dog’s leg!!!”</p><p>Zhang Lei had a change in expression, but he was too lazy to deal with this outlandish youth. However, the more than twenty black-suited men brought by the young man made him secretly vigilant, nonetheless.</p><p>“Who are you, people? This is a private chemical plant. Outsiders are forbidden to step inside!”</p><p>The outlandish youth walked a few steps forward and mocked, “Don’t give me this fucking bullshit! Do you think this young master doesn’t know that this site is the National Virus Research Institute? This Zhao Yundi has asked around before coming here. It was you who caught my sister and detained her here. Get the fucking lost from here, or else I’ll tell my men to break your dog’s leg!”</p><p>Zhang Lei looked at him coolly as he immediately picked up the communicator and ordered, “Encountering threats of unidentified people at the outermost blockade line. The second and third team members are to immediately rush over!”</p><p>Zhao Yundi’s face changed as he angrily glared at Zhang Lei. He then turned around and shouted at a middle-aged man behind him, “Ready to strike! Beat whoever dares to fight and block me. Don’t be idle and shoot back if they dare to use their guns. They dare to catch my sister and say that she’s the carrier of the virus?!! Hmph, if this father can’t rescue her, then I’ll change my surname!”</p><p>Immediately, more than twenty stocky men pulled their guns out of their waists and opened the safety locks at an extremely fast speed. Their synchronized movements and grim atmosphere made Zhang Lei’s heart turn a bit tighter. He used to be a special ops soldier and could naturally sense a soldier aura from these people.</p><p>After a moment’s contemplation, he picked up the communicator and called Director Wei.</p><p>“Director Wei, there’s a young man claiming to be Zhao Yundi, with more than twenty men armed with guns trying to break through the blockade line to the research institute. I request the aid of an armed security team here.”</p><p>“Zhao Yundi? How could that living ancestor come here?”</p><p>Director Wei suddenly exclaimed loudly upon hearing Zhang Lei’s report. A few seconds after, he spoke again, “Don’t act rashly, Zhang Lei! You only need to block them if Zhao Yundi wants to break through the blockade line. But do not use guns! This little ancestor has a very powerful background; I can’t afford to provoke him. I have to ask for instructions from my superiors about this.”</p><p>“Understood!” Although Zhang Lei was dissatisfied. How could Director Wei fear such an individual from the second or third generation of his family... Still, he performed his duties without a question. He pulled two security teams of about thirty to forty people and stood to face the confrontation against Zhang Yundi’s people.</p><p>Tang Xiu sighed inwardly when he heard Zhao Yundi’s name. He had heard of him from Tang Wei. This fella was the biological grandson of the Zhao Family’s Head in Beijing—arrogant, rampant, and loved to stir up trouble. He had even provoked various juniors from the prominent families in Beijing, including the Tang and Yao Family’s juniors, yet he was always able to gain small advantages and dealt big losses.</p><p>It could be said that this guy was just like a fiend in human skin!</p><p>Looking at the two groups of people who were confronting each other, Tang Xiu sighed inwardly and turned around to a more distant spot.</p><p>“Hey hey hey, Buddy! Didn’t you instigate this trouble, too? I just saw him pointing a gun at you! Don’t tell me you lost your fucking balls now? Are you going to run away?” Zhao Yundi called out loudly upon seeing Tang Xiu walking away. He may be the king of the silk pants, but he was not a fool. People who brought guns to break through a state institution would definitely face serious consequences given the situation nowadays. He would have never done such a stupid thing if the detainee was not his biological sister. However, if that guy who was just pointed at by a gun also had a powerful background, then there would be someone else who could help him share the crisis.</p><p>Tang Xiu’s pace came to a halt. After glancing at him, he took out his mobile phone and dialed his aunt—Tang Min’s cell number. After the call was connected, he spoke first, “Auntie, I’m outside the Beijing Virus Research Institute. Could I trouble you to contact the person in charge? I need to go inside to check the condition of the infected patients.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
