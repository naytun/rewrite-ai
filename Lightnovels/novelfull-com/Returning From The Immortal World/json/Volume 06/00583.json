Bluestar Villa Complex was the same as usual, with its streetlights brightly illuminating the villa complex, whereas a faint smell of soil floated up amid the drizzling rain.</p><p>Yang Le was staying in the Villa #11 while quietly hiding in the attic of the building. He constantly observed the surroundings with a binoculars and occasionally glanced at the Villa #9 next door.</p><p>“They are here!”</p><p>A cold glint flashed in his eyes. His left hand grabbed a silver pistol and aimed its muzzle at the several figures approaching Villa #11. Despite Tang Xiu not saying a word that he would help him when he called, he was confident that Tang Xiu would act.</p><p>As a matter of fact, the reason why he didn’t directly leave was that he regarded himself as bait for Tang Xiu to fish several big fish, while also removing trouble for himself.</p><p>Inside the villa #9, Tang Xiu quietly stood next to the window in the study room while observing the situation outside through the slit of the curtain. When several ghostly figures silently appeared outside the courtyard of Villa #11, he then dialed a cell number and spoke a few words words, “The fish entered the net!”</p><p>At this time, even the apprehensive Yang Le was aware that two experts from the Everlasting Feast Hall were already waiting for a long time in his bedroom. They were holding daggers and bloodlust sparks filled their eyes, whereas eight others hid in the other rooms of the villa.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>A martial artist with extraordinary skill easily entered by jumping off the wall, whereas more than a dozen sneaked into the villa using various means. Following which, three figures then appeared from afar.</p><p>“I know you’re at home, Junior Brother! We came to visit you here, why don’t open the door and invite us inside?” Yao Qinglong’s loud voice sounded from the courtyard outside.</p><p>On the corner of the attic, Yang Le looked through the slit on the window toward the three people standing outside. He was silent for a while before walking out of the attic and standing on the edge of the building, saying, “Since all the people you brought here have already come in, do the three of you still need me to open the door?”</p><p>The trio exchanged looks as they immediately jumped over the front gate with ease, and quickly appeared in the courtyard. At this moment, the originally dark villa turned bright, as six stocky men who had sneaked into the villa ahead of time appeared in the first floor hall.</p><p>“Junior Brother, you don’t need to hide your head and tuck your tail in front of your martial brothers, right?” Said Yao Qinglong lightly.</p><p>Yang Le’s figure appeared on the stairs. As he stepped down the staircase, his grim eyes swept over the six stocky men before eventually landing on the trio. He then took a deep sigh before coming to their front and saying, “To be honest, maybe I still care about the feeling of fellowship between us, thus I could guarantee your lives if you didn’t come tonight. Unfortunately, the moment you step into my courtyard, the only thing between us now is a life and death struggle.”</p><p>“Tell me, Junior Brother. Who the fuck gives you such confidence?” Du Yanghe jeered. “Life and death fight, huh? Bah… it is you who will die, whereas we’ll live.”</p><p>“We were careless and let you escape from us several times back then, Junior Brother,” said Qiu Jian coldly. “But this time, we have laid down an inescapable net for you. It’s impossible for you to escape again even if you have wings plugged into your body. Hence, do hand over all the things left behind by our Master before his death if you don’t wanna die! Else don’t blame for us being ruthless and ignoring our fellowship.”</p><p>Yang Le shot them a look, as he then suddenly burst into laughter and said, “This is so funny that it’s ridiculous! Now I suddenly have a feeling that the death of our Master must be related to you all.”</p><p>“Huh?” Yao Qinglong, Du Yanghe, and Qiu Jian all had a change in expression.</p><p>With his astute mind, Yang Le could observe the tiny changes in their expressions and could sense the problem instantly as he shouted again, “Don’t think that I don’t know. Master was very healthy back then, yet he suddenly fell ill and passed away early. The three of you are nothing but despicable and shameless scumbags who forgot the grace of Master’s teachings, even committed high treason, assaulting the old man treacherously. What a huge disgrace!”</p><p>Yao Qinglong only frowned and watched Yang Le in silence.</p><p>The hot tempered Du Yanghe, however, couldn’t keep the matter inside and directly admitted after hearing Yang Le’s words, “Fine! We’ll no longer conceal it anymore since you already found out. He was indeed our Master, but he had been very partial and doted on you more than on the three of us. If we didn’t kill him, he would likely give all his treasures to you.”</p><p>“SECOND BROTHER!” Yao Qinglong’s expression suddenly changed greatly as he angrily shouted at him.</p><p>A disbelieving expression burst from Yang Le’s eyes, making his pupil contract, as he said in a thick and heavy voice, “I never thought it was really you who did it!”</p><p>Yao Qinglong took a deep breath before taking a step toward Yang Le and saying in the same deep voice, “Since you’ve discovered the true cause of Master’s death from Second Brother—this damned fool, then we don’t need to hide it any longer. That’s right, it was us who gave that geezer a poison that took effect slowly and finally killed him. So what, do you want to get revenge for that old fogy?”</p><p>Yang Le’s eyes turned bloodshot as he glared at the trio with a look of full hatred, wishing he could immediately hack their limbs and dismember their bodies into eight pieces. [1]</p><p>“Ahhh, today’s matter can’t end up in friendly terms, it seems.” Yao Qinglong shook his head and sighed. “Yang Le, you still have a chance to live. That is to take out all of the wealth of that geezer. Else, tonight will be the time of your death, period.”</p><p>Yang Le gritted his teeth and bit his lips as he glared at the three aggressive scumbags. He finally looked upward and roared, “TANG XIU, HELP ME KILL THEM! THIS YANG LE PLEDGES TO SERVE YOU AS YOUR SUBORDINATE IN THE FUTURE!”</p><p>“IT’S A DEAL!”</p><p>Tang Xiu’s figure appeared in the hall like lightning. Behind him was Chi Nan, who was playing with a sharp dagger as she shot a playful smile at Yao Qinglong and the others.</p><p>The moment Tang Xiu appeared, Yao Qinglong’s face greatly changed. He could recognize his identity instantly—a member of the Tang Family, the culprit who ruined his Yao Family.</p><p>“IT’S A TRAP!”</p><p>Yao Qinglong roared and dashed toward the left corridor.</p><p>Neither Tang Xiu nor Chi Nan moved. Just as Yao Qinglong ran across the corridor and was about to pass through the door, a large foot directly kicked his chest, sending him flying upside down and hitting the opposite door behind him and breaking it.</p><p>Hmph…</p><p>From the smashed door, an expert of the Everlasting Feast Hall easily grabbed his neck and strode to the living room and then threw him before Tang Xiu.</p><p>Du Yanghe and Qiu Jian were flabbergasted. They never dreamed that things would turn out this way. Prior to this, they came here with greed filling their hearts, and trying to get the large fortune left by their Master by killing Yang Le. Never once they imagined that they would fall into a trap.</p><p>“WHO ARE YOU?”</p><p>Panicked, Du Yanghe’s horrified gaze withdrew from Yao Qinglong as he stared at Tang Xiu and roared.</p><p>“You really are an idiot!” Tang Xiu shook his head and smilingly said. “Given Yang Le’s disposition, don’t tell me you that didn’t have a clue that he had something to rely on by staying here? Hehe, who I am, you ask? That’s a very interesting question, you know. But I don’t feel like I need to tell you myself, because that eldest senior brother of yours should know, right? Did I speak incorrectly, Yao Qinglong?”</p><p>Blood flowed from the corner of Yao Qinglong’s mouth as he attempted to get up from the floor. There was hatred in his eyes as he glared at Tang Xiu and spoke, “What you said is not wrong. I hail from the Yao Family who got ruined by you. I just never thought that this stupid Junior Brother of mine turned out to be in cahoots with you and even deployed this trap to pull us in.”</p><p>“What? Are you scared or something?” Tang Xiu chuckled.</p><p>“Afraid? Only a few people in this world can make I, Yao Qinglong, afraid. And you, you’re simply not among them!” Yang Qinglong straightened up and sneered. “But I’m curious about something. How does Yang Le know you?”</p><p>Tang Xiu pointed to the direction of the building nearby and said, “We’re neighbors.”</p><p>Neighbors?</p><p>Yao Qinglong was so vexed, he felt like he got wronged and driven to death. Although the people he sent to investigate Yang Le informed him that he lived in the Bluestar Villa Complex, never once he expected that Tang Xiu would actually live here as well.</p><p>“Akka, I need your help!” Yao Qinglong grabbed his mobile and spoke after dialing a number.</p><p>“You should be moving the reinforcement, right?” Tang Xiu chuckled. “Alright. I’ll give you plenty of time to showcase everything you got. Before this, however, let us remove the garbage—the shrimp soldiers and crab generals you brought here, so as not to be eyesores.”</p><p>As Tang Xiu’s voice faded away, six bodies were thrown into the hall from various places. These people were the hiding martial artists brought by the Yao Qinglong trio. As the trio had their facial expressions changed greatly, Chi Nan dashed in and appeared in front of those stocky men as her dagger rose and fell, instantly slicing their throats. Blood splattered and their bodies fell to the floor, convulsing and gradually embracing their deaths.</p><p>“What a thick smell of blood. I really like it!”</p><p>A hoarse voice came from outside the hall. There was no footstep sound, but a thin figure appeared at the hall’s door. The man was dressed in a black robe and had long, loose golden hair. His handsome face looked pale, making him look like the Grim Reaper.</p><p>Chi Nan, who had just acted and killed six men and had returned to Tang Xiu’s side, instantly squinted her eyes when she saw the man. She let out a faint playful smile and said, “Grim Reaper Akka, you like the smell of blood, eh? Then stay here, I’ll personally make you smell your own blood.”</p><p>Akka, who had a British look, looked toward Chi Nan and his body suddenly shuddered as he clearly saw Chi Nan’s face. His pupils momentarily contracted and moved to run away almost subconsciously.</p><p>“COME BACK HERE!”</p><p>Tang Xiu’s figure streaked toward the outside like lightning and blocked Akka’s path in the blink of an eye. Along with a barrage of fists toward Akka’s chest, the man was straightly sent back into the hall.</p><p>“WHAT?”</p><p>Yao Qinglong’s body shook, as he could hardly believe his eyes. He knew very well who Akka was—an expert he had hired from that organization for a huge sum of money. But an expert recognized by that organization was so easily defeated by Tang Xiu?</p><p>After struggling to get up from the floor, Akka’s eyes only stayed on Tang Xiu for a moment before they eventually landed on Chi Nan, as he spoke with a terrified expression, “Lady Instructor, I didn’t expect to see you here. It’s really a great honor to be able to see your graceful figure once again in my life.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
