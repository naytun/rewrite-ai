He found that even though these two youngsters were not inferior to him, they were not much stronger than him either. The odds of winning may be extremely slim given that he had to face two adversaries, but it would also very difficult for them if they wanted to kill him.</p><p>Tang Xiu, who was quietly sitting on a chair, produced a piece of jade out of thin air upon seeing that the three had began to act. He then accurately threw it under the chair and activated the array he had arranged in advance. Along with the wake of a layer of light curtain that moved on the wall, the shockwaves created by the three’s fight was blocked by the array’s light curtain.</p><p>“I showed you the path to the gate of heaven, yet you chose to throw yourself to the gate of the underworld. Dongbei Hu, even if you can barely manage to retain your feeble existence and resist for some time you still won’t be able to protect them.”</p><p>Tang Xiu flicked two silver needles, directly piercing Yao Chengqing’s and Yao Xinhua’s glabella lightning fast. With his extremely exquisite control of the two silver needles, they didn’t directly kill them after it pierced their foreheads but stunned them, temporarily making them lose their consciousness instead.</p><p>“KILL HIM!!!”</p><p>One of the martial arts grandmasters of the Yao Family shouted. Although the mortal combat between the two youngsters and Dongbei Hu greatly shocked them, he saw the hope of killing Tang Xiu, as he drew his blade and aggressively darted toward him.</p><p>The rest of the dozens of experts of the Yao Family finally snapped back to their senses and followed that martial arts grandmaster. They never saw Tang Xiu display his strength, thus they thought he didn’t have any abilities despite having two formidable subordinates. As long as they could kill him, it would bring some effect to his two men. Once the experts in the fight had their focus disturbed they would be able to take care of them.</p><p>“DIE!!!”</p><p>An expert of the Yao Family, who was the first to sprint toward Tang Xiu, raised his blade to hack Tang Xiu, and his blade was as though about to cleave Tang Xiu’s body into two.</p><p>“Courting death!”</p><p>Tang Xiu’s expression turned cold. The sword image inscribed on his palm flushed away and pierced through the right side of the man’s chest. The sword was as if a roaming fish that shuttled back and forth unceasingly and struck the hearts of the dozen experts of the Yao Family that had yet to approach Tang Xiu. Along with their screaming, they fell to the floor, convulsed and died.</p><p>“Another flying sword?”</p><p>Dongbei Hu was still paying attention to Tang Xiu while fighting. What shocked him was that Tang Xiu also used a flying sword. He could hardly believe that such a divine weapon would exist in this world. It was even more difficult for him to accept that there were two of them today.</p><p>Who exactly are these people?</p><p>If the Tang Family really possessed such a formidable force, shouldn’t the Yao Family have been exterminated long ago? But why did the Tang Family kept showing that they were unable to raise their heads and come out of the pressure from the Yao Family for so many years?</p><p>When he was a bit distracted, a sword light suddenly pierced his arm. His face changed greatly as another sword light swept across to cleave him. At the same time, several silver needles flashed toward him like lightning bolts at the same time, and instantly appeared before Dongbei Hu, who was currently impeded by the sword light.</p><p>Puff! Puff! Puff! Puff!</p><p>Right after Dongbei Hu escaped from the sword light, those four lightning bolts silently pierced his body without creating any sounds. Those four lightning bolts didn’t directly penetrate his body, but messed up his internal organs instead.</p><p>Puff…</p><p>Blood crazily spurted out from Dongbei Hu’s mouth, as intense dread gushed out from his heart. The two flying swords suddenly broke out above his head as layers of sword images overlapped and spiraled toward his head.</p><p>“SCRAM!!!”</p><p>Out of desperation, Dongbei Hu punched the flashing sword images, but they were as though a meat grinder that crushed his fists to pieces. Along with a splattering mist of blood, a dark form appeared behind Dongbei Hu, as a sharp dagger pierced his waist the moment after. A hooked whip that was formed from True Essence took out his Golden Core in a flash and Dark neatly threw it to Tang Xiu, who was still sitting on the chair.</p><p>“Shake and seal!”</p><p>Tang Xiu’s eyes lit up as he constantly waved his hands. An array to isolate it was arranged in an instant and, at the same time, cut off the connection between the Golden Core and Dongbei Hu. He then quickly stored it inside his interspatial ring.</p><p>“Ah…”</p><p>This time Dongbei Hu was utterly desperate. Never once had he ever imagined that the two youngsters before him had so many fighting techniques. It was beyond his imagination that their collaboration was far beyond what he could fight against. From the beginning until now the fight lasted less than a minute, yet his Golden Core had already been snatched.</p><p>His shattered internal organs could possibly recover with his Golden Core still in his body, but losing it meant that he had lost his most important thing.</p><p>I have nothing else left to reverse the situation.</p><p>Deep regret grew inside his heart. He finally realized that he really was a frog at the bottom of a well. He thought he was one of the strongest in the entire China, but he never expected to lose his life at the hands of these two youngsters.</p><p>A moment ago Tang Xiu gave him a chance, but he missed it because of his arrogance. And prior to this, Tang Xiu also reminded him of this because he was too arrogant and conceited!</p><p>At this moment, the desperation he felt inside and the taste of regret caused him to almost die directly. He was no longer able to keep his life, and couldn’t help but regret as to why he didn’t drink the send-off wine Daoist Xu Yang wanted to give him.</p><p>“I’m not willing!!!”</p><p>Along with a roar, Dongbei Hu’s body was cleaved and split in half.</p><p>With a content smile, Tang Xiu took back the silver needles on Yao Chengqing and Yao Xinhua’s glabella. As the two men woke up, he lit up a cigarette and looked at the father and son, he smilingly said, “I can also give you a chance. Tell the Head of your family to come here. You two—father and son can go on living if he comes here. But if he doesn’t, then you will suffer from inhuman torments.”</p><p>Yao Chengqing could clearly see the scene before him, making his heart turn cold. The dozens of experts of the Yao Family he brought with him were completely decimated, and what horrified him the most was that the Amur Tiger, who was famed for his strength, had been killed.</p><p>Wasn’t the Amur Tiger one of the strongest experts in the entire China? How could he be killed so easily? Did this wretched Tang Xiu employ a despicable method to do that? Thought Yao Chengqing in despair.</p><p>He was not aware that his son, Yao Xinhua, was even more desperate than him at this moment after hearing Tang Xiu’s words.</p><p>Suddenly, Yao Xinhua grabbed a sharp dagger on his leg that was previously concealed by his trouser. At this moment, it was as if he had suddenly erupted with hidden potential, as a blade light flashed and then pierced Yao Chengqing’s heart.</p><p>“What?\"</p><p>Yao Chengqing’s pupil violently contracted. He stared wide-eyed with disbelief. He lowered his head with difficulty to look at the dagger stuck in his chest and then looked at the dagger’s hilt in the hand of his son, Yao Xinhua.</p><p>“W-Why?” Yao Chengqing’s voice was trembling.</p><p>Yao Xinhua let out a mirthless smile. There was a pained expression on his face as two tears fell down from his eyes, as he then hoarsely replied, “Father, I told you to kill me so that I wouldn't see such a scene again, and to not continue to bear that kind of pain as well. Tang Xiu’s methods are too ruthless; that kind of pain is not something ordinary people are able to imagine. I can’t withstand such a pain, neither do I have the means to stop it. Seeking my own death is impossible even if I want to in that kind of pain. I have experienced it, so I don’t want you to taste the same pain; a taste that you’re so hungry to stay alive yet you want to die but is unable to.”</p><p>After saying that, he kneeled in front of Yao Chengqing. Then, he suddenly turned his head to Tang Xiu and put the dagger on his neck, shouting, “Surnamed Tang, we lost! We suffered a crushing defeat to you. We can die, but your wish to make my grandfather come here to die as well will come to nothing!”</p><p>“Yao Xinhua, I didn’t stop you since it was kind of interesting seeing you killing your own father,” said Tang Xiu with a smile. “But do you think you can commit suicide if I wish you to remain alive?”</p><p>Yao Xinhua’s body quivered. He suddenly exerted his strength. At the moment when the dagger was about to pierce the skin of his neck, a black light suddenly flashed and directly cut his wrist, separating it from his arm.</p><p>AAARRRGGGHHH…</p><p>Yao Xinhua let out a blood-curdling scream, as the wrenching pain turned his eyes bloodshot.</p><p>Tang Xiu stood up from the chair and went toward Yao Xinhua. His eyes didn’t look at him but instead fixated at Yao Chengqing who had not yet died. He smiled and lightly said, “If you don’t want your son to be tortured to the point where he’s starving to stay alive yet wanting to die but unable to have both, then call the Head of your family here. You only have half a minute.”</p><p>Yao Chengqing looked at his son in despair. He finally understood why his son did such a thing. Since they would certainly meet their deaths today, his son just wanted him to have a content death without going through torture before he died.</p><p>What ruthlessness!</p><p>With a pained feeling, Yao Chengqing closed his eyes and bit off his own tongue.</p><p>“Oh…, sigh.” Tang Xiu shook his head and turned to Yao Xinhua, but found he also had bitten his tongue off. He immediately creased his brows as he shook his head and sighed, “This should have been needless! All along, it was your Yao Family that has always wanted to exterminate us. I originally wanted your family to exist for a few more years, too. But, I never thought that you would bring about your own destruction. Since you all want to die that badly, I’ll also show a bit of kindness and make you less tormented!”</p><p>A blade rose and then fell as the father and son—Yao Chengqing and Yao Xinhua were instantly killed by Tang Xiu.</p><p>While standing in the hall and looking at the dead bodies on the floor around, Tang Xiu commanded with a still expression, “Burn this haunted house down and let the fire burn all the bodies to ashes.”</p><p>Suddenly, a hazy figure appeared out of nowhere. It was Daoist Xu Yang, whose face was a bit saddened as he looked at Dongbei Hu’s body that had been split in half. He drank the wine in the jar and then sprayed it on Dongbei Hu’s body as he murmured, “Had you not caused trouble and provoked others, how would others kill you for it? The heavens may forgive your sins, but you will have to pay for your evil deeds with your life! Old friend, may you go in peace in your journey.”</p><p>Tang Xiu glanced at Daoist Xu Yang before he turned away.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
