At this time, nearly all the core members of the Tang Family had arrived. There were also hundreds of experts trained by the Tang Family tightly blockading a radius of a few hundred meters from the residence.</p><p>“There is no news yet?” Finally, Tang Guosheng couldn’t bear to ask.</p><p>Tang Min, who stood at the side with unsightly face, shook her head without speaking.</p><p>Suddenly, a few figures rushed into the courtyard. Tang Wei and Tang Tang shouted as they came inside, “Grandpa, we’re back!”</p><p>Tang Guosheng’s complexion changed as pleasant surprise burst in his eyes. He welcomed the two of them and loudly said, “Great! Great! It’s great that you came back safely. Where’s Xiu’er? Didn’t he save you? Why isn’t he with you?”</p><p>“Grandpa, Xiu instructed us to come back ahead of him and said that he must stay to deal with the people from the Yao Family,” said Tang Wei. “Also, he had his men kill a lot of Yao Family’s men before we left. Ah, right. Yao Xinlei and Yao Xintao were killed by Xiu’s men, and that Yao Xinhua was also castrated and became the last living eunuch by him.”</p><p>Tang Guosheng’s complexion changed yet again. He didn’t feel happy because the three juniors of the Yao Family were killed, and instead felt horrified inside. Then he asked in a heavy voice, “Little Wei, are you sure that Xiu’er can stand and fight against those men from the Yao Family? That Amur Tiger…”</p><p>“Grandpa, Xiu is someone with discretion. He won’t stay there and wait to die if he doesn’t have full assurance of doing so.” Tang Wei unexpectedly interrupted Tang Guosheng. “Rest assured, Grandpa! Maybe he’ll come back soon.”</p><p>“Nonsense! Though he knows a bit of Kung fu, who do you think the Amur Tiger is?” Tang Guosheng angrily yelled. “He’s a cultivator who has survived for more than a century, a monster that even the leaders of the state dread! Yunpeng, stay here and organize the members of the Tang Family to immediately withdraw from the capital. I’ll bring some people to personally find Xiu’er. I cannot let him suffer any harm even if I must die!”</p><p>Tang Yunde walked forward and sternly spoke, “Father, you stay here! Xiu’er is my son, and I, as his father, must go there personally. I’ll take the men over there.”</p><p>“You are his father, then who do you think I am?” Tang Guosheng angrily shouted. “I’m his grandfather! Do as I command and hurry up! Yunqing, you are to rush back and mobilize those twenty-seven armed forces at once, and wait for my order! Once… once the Yao Family begins the onslaught to exterminate us, we’ll fight them to the death and perish together with them!”</p><p>“Understood!” Tang Yunqing replied, called out his son, Tang Ning, and quickly ran toward the outside.</p><p>Tang Guosheng looked at Tang Min and spoke in a heavy voice, “You go back to the armed forces and wait for my next order!”</p><p>“Understood!” Tang Min replied and quickly left.</p><p>Just as Tang Yunqing, his son, and Tang Min were about to leave the courtyard, two figures flashed and blocked their way.</p><p>“What are you guys trying to do?” Tang Yunqing recognized the identity of the two men in front of them. They came from Jingmen Island and were Tang Xiu’s men.</p><p>“Mr. Tang, what you know about our Boss is very minute, so you probably don’t believe in his abilities,” respectfully said an expert of the Everlasting Feast Hall. “Also, you are unaware of the true foundation of the Everlasting Feast Hall. Please cast aside your worry for now and wait here, or you can call the Boss directly and inquire him about the situation over there.”</p><p>Tang Yunqing turned his head and looked at Tang Guosheng.</p><p>The latter was silent for a moment before immediately grabbing his mobile phone and dialing Tang Xiu’s number. The call was connected after a short while.</p><p>“Where are you now, Xiu’er? How is the situation at your side?” Asked Tang Guosheng in a hurry.</p><p>“Ah, I was just about to call you, Grandpa,” said Tang Xiu with a light chuckle. “I didn’t expect that you moved a step ahead of me. Anyways, everything here has all been solved already, so I’m on my way back now.”</p><p>“Huh, solved? What exactly has been solved?” Asked Tang Guosheng quickly.</p><p>“What else? We have killed them all,” said Tang Xiu with a chuckle.</p><p>Tang Guosheng was startled, “But what about the Amur Tiger? Didn’t he go there?”</p><p>“Yeah, he came. He was slain by my men,” said Tang Xiu. “Also, I killed Yao Chengqing. He’s the son of the Yao Family’s Head. It can be considered as venting the anger of our family for the time being.”</p><p>“What did you say? You killed Yao Chengqing?” Tang Guosheng was flabbergasted. “Also… you said that your men have killed the Amur Tiger? How could that be possible?”</p><p>“Grandpa, is it really that difficult to kill Dongbei Hu?” Asked Tang Xiu with a light chuckle. “I already told you that my ability is not something you can imagine. Let alone one Amur Tiger, even if there were ten of him, they wouldn’t be able to keep their lives for long.”</p><p>Tang Guosheng was still hardly able to accept the fact that the Amur Tiger had been killed. After falling into silence for a short while, he then immediately said, “Xiu’er, since the matter over there has been solved already, then come back here at once. I’ll be waiting for you at home!”</p><p>“Understood!” Tang Xiu answered and then hang up.</p><p>Outside the haunted house.</p><p>While looking at the burning haunted house, Tang Xiu’s eyes flashed with a cold light within. Light silently stood behind him, but there was not the slightest trace of Dark.</p><p>“Daoist Xu Yang, it will be inconvenient for you to continue following me since Dongbei Hu has died already. So, you can go anywhere you choose from here! I hope you can keep the matter of my Everlasting Feast Hall confidential as well.”</p><p>Daoist Xu Yang was silent for a moment before slowly nodding, “I understand, Daoist Tang. I won’t disclose anything that happened here! However, there’s something I need to discuss with you.”</p><p>Tang Xiu nodded, “Speak!”</p><p>“If I have some free time later, can I consult with you at the Everlasting Feast Hall? I realized that I’m nothing but a frog at the bottom of the well, even mistakenly believing that your strength was not as good as mine. But now I fully realize that if you were to really fight me, then I’m afraid you can easily kill me.”</p><p>Tang Xiu pondered for a moment before nodding, “All right. You helped me dealing with my issue in the Resting Cemetery Island, after all, so I can give you my word on your request. But, contact me first before you go to the Everlasting Feast Hall, since I rarely stay there in normal times.”</p><p>“I already got your contact, so I’ll be sure to call you in advance later,” said Daoist Xu Yang quickly.</p><p>“Alright, then you go first!” Said Tang Xiu.</p><p>Along with Daoist Xu Yang’s departure, Tang Xiu, Light and Dark quickly left and went to the Tang Family’s ancestral residence.</p><p>At this time, all the members of the Tang Family were waiting in silence in the residence. The atmosphere in the entire courtyard was especially heavy and somber. Just as Tang Xiu arrived, all the eyes of the core members of the family fell on him, as the anxious Su Lingyun hurriedly rushed toward Tang Xiu and quickly asked, “Are you alright, Xiu’er?”</p><p>Tang Xiu let out a smile and shook his head as he gently hugged his mother and smilingly said, “Mom, do I look like someone who just got something bad? Rest assured! It’s just a minor problem and I have solved it already.”</p><p>“How is this a minor problem? This…” rebuked Su Lingyun.</p><p>“I’m no longer a child, Mom. I know what I’m doing.” Tang Xiu interrupted her and smilingly said. “You don’t want to see our Tang Family be forced to leave China by the Yao Family, right?”</p><p>“No, I don’t want to see it happen.” Su Lingyun shook her head.</p><p>“So, with an enormous ability, it’s a given that I have to deal with a big matter as well.” Tang Xiu smilingly said. “Please rest your worries, Mom! I’ll definitely pay attention to my own safety.”</p><p>Su Lingyun nodded.</p><p>After releasing Su Lingyun, Tang Xiu then came before Tang Guosheng and smilingly said, “Grandpa, the Amur Tiger died and his dead body has been burnt as well. Also, Yao Chengqing, Yao Xinhua, Yao Xinlei, and Yao Xintao—the four members of the Yao Family have also been slain by my men. We also killed dozens of experts of the Yao Family who were at martial arts grandmaster level in the process.”</p><p>Tang Guosheng couldn’t help but tremble inside upon hearing Tang Xiu’s report. The biggest enemy of the Tang Family was the Yao Family and Dongbei Hu. With the Amur Tiger dead and the Yao Family suffering such a huge blow, this was definitely great news for the Tang Family. Only, he was still puzzled as to how Tang Xiu was able to kill the Amur Tiger.</p><p>While keeping his smile, Tang Xiu pointed to Light and lightly said, “Grandpa, his name is Light and he’s my grand disciple. There’s also another one, Dark, but it’s inconvenient for her to appear here. They both have strength matching the Amur Tiger.”</p><p>Tang Guosheng was taken aback. He carefully sized up Light before contently nodding, “What a good boy! I didn’t expect you to be so young, yet you’re as strong as that Dongbei Hu who has lived for more than a century.”</p><p>“You overpraise me,” replied Light with a faint smile.</p><p>Tang Guosheng’s eyes went back to Tang Xiu as he spoke, “Xiu’er, since the Amur Tiger is dead, then we…”</p><p>A cold look appeared on Tang Xiu’s eyes as he said in a cold voice, “Since the Yao Family really wants to lose all decorum with us, we definitely must not endure any longer. The earlier we remove this latent danger, the smoother our family’s development will be. Grandpa, could you hand over the authority of our family’s forces to me temporarily? I assure you that the Yao Family will be removed from the capital within three days.”</p><p>“Xiu’er, can we discuss this issue over again?” Tang Guosheng quickly said. “The Yao Family has a deep and solid foundation. Even if our family get rid of them, I’m afraid that we’ll also suffer quite a loss as well.”</p><p>“There will be sixty experts arriving in Beijing tonight at the latest. They are all cultivators, and the weakest among them is stronger than a martial arts grandmaster. With them cooperating with us, is it possible for the Yao Family to resist such a terrifying force even though they have a solid foundation?”</p><p>Tang Guosheng was flabbergasted and couldn’t believe his own ears.</p><p>Sixty experts, with each of them more powerful than a martial arts grandmaster?</p><p>At the side, each and every member of the Tang Family looked at Tang Xiu with shocked expressions. Never once had they ever dreamed that Tang Xiu actually possessed such a terrifying force.</p><p>Tang Yunde strode toward Tang Xiu and asked with a serious expression, “Son, you are not lying, right? These many experts are really coming?”</p><p>“Yes!” Tang Xiu nodded heavily.</p><p>Tang Yunde then turned his head to Tang Guosheng and said in a deep voice, “Father, I believe him! We all have seen him in action before, and I believe you’ve witnessed it as well! Give him the authority! We, the Tang Family, cannot tolerate this any longer!”</p><p>Tang Guosheng seemed to have made up his mind as well, as he replied in a deep voice, “If so, then let’s get started! I’ll make a few calls as well!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
