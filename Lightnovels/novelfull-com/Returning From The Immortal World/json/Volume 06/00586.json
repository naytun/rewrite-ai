The driver was a beautiful girl, and even though her beauty was not on par with Mu Wanying, she could still be regarded as a goddess in the eyes of many male youths.</p><p>Her name was Li Jing, a real estate saleswoman of the Loran Villa Complex.</p><p>Li Jing’s recent performance was very poor, because she wasn’t willing to accept some unspoken rules in the real estate market sales. Her manager had even warned her that she must pack her stuff and leave directly if she couldn’t sell a house this month. Therefore, despite feeling irritated inside, she also looked forward with impatient expectancy, hoping that a bankroller customer would come to visit; and it would be best if the bankroller was a woman.</p><p>Today, however, just as she was pondering over the matter at the gate of the sales center, she saw a good-looking couple coming toward her. She really looked forward to it, because the couple looked like they were very rich given how they dressed up and the luxury sports cars they came with.</p><p>“Mr. Tang, Ms. Mu, we have only four villas left in this Loran Villa Complex now. I’ve already presented three of them to you in the sales center, and all of them don’t meet your satisfaction. Then I’ll take you directly to villa #9. Please come with me! The villa is very close to here.”</p><p>Tang Xiu and Mu Wanying nodded slightly and followed Li Jing for a couple of minutes before arriving at the front gate of villa #9. It was a European-style villa with a total of three floors, a large area, and the most satisfactory aspect was that it boasted hundreds of square meters of lawn and garden before its gate.</p><p>“It’s very stylish. The price shouldn’t be cheap either, yes?” Asked Tang Xiu with a smile.</p><p>“Indeed.” Li Jing said, “The housing price has been sharply increasing as of recently, reaching 145,000 yuan per square meter. The lawn and garden outside the villa are complimentary, but the villa itself still has 460 square meters. The total price is 66.7 million yuan, and with a 5% discount I can give you, the net price will be 63.365 million. I can also help you reduce it by 65,000 yuan more if you pay up front.”</p><p>Tang Xiu shot Mu Wanying a look of inquiry.</p><p>Mu Wanying nodded silently, indicating that the price was acceptable to her. This impressed Tang Xiu, because he didn’t expect that she earned such a huge sum of money within such a short time.</p><p>Afterward, the duo came to the villa under Li Jing’s guidance. The overall layout was great, and there was also a very spacious private pool on the west side of the first floor. For a villa to have such an indoor private swimming pool nowadays was very rare.</p><p>“I’ll take it!” After having a look, Mu Wanying straightly gave her decision.</p><p>A pleasantly surprised expression appeared in Li Jing’s eyes. She then left the villa with Tang Xiu and Mu Wanying toward the sales center to handle the transaction formalities. Han Jintong, who had waited for some time outside the door, blocked the path of the trio.</p><p>“Are you not basking yourself under the sun today, Uncle Han? Did you come out to stroll around?” Li Jing was obviously very familiar with Han Jintong as she greeted him with a smile.</p><p>Han Jintong let out a faint smile and slightly nodded in response before his eyes shifted to Tang Xiu. There was a respectful expression on his face when he spoke, “Are you here to buy a house, Mr. Tang?”</p><p>Tang Xiu also didn’t expect that he would meet Han Jintong here. He shook his head and replied, “It’s not me, I’m just accompanying a friend to buy one.”</p><p>Han Jintong shot Mu Wanying a look and felt a tinge of regret inside. He also wondered that, if his granddaughter were to try harder and take more initiative, perhaps there would be some chances left for her to be with Tang Xiu. But after having a look at Mu Wanying, he realized that there was no hope left for his granddaughter, because Mu Wanying was too beautiful. Not only was she on par with his granddaughter but even better.</p><p>“Oh, given his status and capacity, could it perhaps that only such a girl deserves to be with him?” Han Jintong sighed deeply inwardly.</p><p>“Do you know Mr. Tang, Uncle Han?” The saleswoman—Li Jing was surprised.</p><p>Without waiting for Han Jintong to answer her question, Tang Xiu preemptively answered it, “Yeah, I met him once, but we are not too familiar, though.”</p><p>Han Jintong’s breath lagged, and he immediately forced a bitter smile inside. Had it been someone else, he would have slapped the person before turning around to leave. But how could he afford to offend such a Master?! A bit of awkwardness appeared on his old face, as he said, “Though I only met Mr. Tang once, I admire him very much. Little Li, since Mr. Tang’s friend wants to buy a house here, you should give a bigger discount and reduce the price more!”</p><p>“Then I’ll call the Manager right away,” said Li Jing quickly.</p><p>Tang Xiu furrowed his brows as he looked at Han Jintong and asked, “Is your face very valuable here?”</p><p>Cough! Cough…</p><p>This sentence made Han Jintong choke and cough a few times. He couldn’t be more than eager to run away from here, and yet he still came over to express his goodwill, hence the reply, “It should be worth some dime. The owner of this villa complex is the right-hand man of my second son, and I’m also staying in my second son’s place right now.”</p><p>Tang Xiu nodded at him in response, as he looked at Li Jing and said, “Call your manager, then. Let’s conclude the transaction according to the price we’ve agreed before! Do you have any problems with it, Wanying?”</p><p>A strange light glinted in Mu Wanying’s eyes. Smart as she was, she could immediately understand that Tang Xiu didn’t want to accept the goodwill from the old man in front of him, and even deliberately kept a distance. Therefore, she let out a faint smile and said, “I have no problem with that. I’m fine with signing the deal and paying up front.”</p><p>Li Jing was somewhat awkward being caught in the middle, as she looked at Tang Xiu and Han Jintong in front. She got the cell number of her manager from her phone book, but she wasn’t sure whether she should dial it.</p><p>Han Jintong let out a hollow laugh and knew that Tang Xiu didn’t want to accept his goodwill, and immediately said, “Do it according to the will of Mr. Tang. Customers have always been the kings, thus you must spare no effort to serve them. Anyways… I have other things to tend to, so I won’t be able to accompany you, Mr. Tang. I’ll take my leave, then.”</p><p>Having said that, Han Jintong walked away with a crestfallen expression.</p><p>As a smart girl, Li Jing could tell that Han Jintong obviously wanted to express his goodwill to Tang Xiu. Therefore, she secretly decided that she must report this incident after meeting her Manager and try to give this particular customer more discounts if possible.</p><p>“Everyone, let’s return to the sales center!”</p><p>****</p><p>Inside the sales center.</p><p>Fang Qiang comfortably sat with tilted legs on the European style sofa while his eyes fixated on the charming Hao Qian standing in front of him. As the sales center manager, he had many privileges as well as plenty of ill-gotten gains. In particular, he made all the saleswoman who worked here fawn on him.</p><p>“Qianqian, are we going to have dinner tonight?”</p><p>What was inside his mind was Hao Qian’s tender white flesh in her uniform made him hot inside. He was not a good man, as he got several saleswomen in this sales center on his bed. And the beautiful Hao Qian in front of him was also no exception.</p><p>Hao Qian intentionally pouted her mouth and replied a bit coquettishly, “Sure, accompanying you to dinner won’t be a problem, Brother Qiang. It’s just that my client hopes that you can cut the price a bit for the villa #9. You see…”</p><p>Slightly furrowing his brows, Fang Qiang said, “The price I gave him is very low already, yet he wants it to drop even more? This won’t do! Besides, selling the villas in the Loran Villa Complex is very easy. Even if he doesn’t buy it now, I’m sure there will be other clients who will come to see the house a few days later. Anyhow, if it’s not good for him, just push him off.”</p><p>Hao Qian immediately felt anxious. She then came to Fang Qiang and sat on his lap. After looking around and finding that nobody was paying attention to the corner where they were at, she immediately placed her hand on his thigh as her slender, small fingers drew a circle on the inside of his thigh, saying, “Brother Qiang, other clients may indeed come, but counting it as a result of my professional work is hard to say! You can facilitate and make things easier for me, wouldn’t that be good? At the worst… I will just put on that nurse uniform you bought me last time if things come to worst.”</p><p>“Really?” Asked Fang Qiang quickly as his spirit was aroused.</p><p>“Absolutely, I’ll put it on tonight,” said Hao Qian seriously.</p><p>Fang Qiang raised his hand to touch his chin and pondered for a few seconds before happily replying, “It’s a deal! Make that client come sign the transaction in the afternoon. Tell him that I only have time for him this afternoon.”</p><p>“Great! Thanks a bunch, Brother Qiang.” Hao Qian gleefully glanced around before hugging Fang Qiang’s neck and forcefully kissing his face. She then took her mobile to make a call. After a minute, she had a conversation with the other party and agreed to sign the house purchase agreement at 2:30 PM in the sales center.</p><p>Ten minutes later, Li Jing briskly stepped inside the sales center along with Tang Xiu and Mu Wanying.</p><p>“Mr. Tang, Ms. Mu, please wait in the rest area first. I’ll make the contract and we’ll sign the house purchase agreement later.”</p><p>“All right!” Tang Xiu and Mu Wanying were not in a hurry and headed to the rest area to sit.</p><p>After Li Jing busily spent some time to make the house purchase agreement, she didn’t immediately go to see Tang Xiu and Mu Wanying but looked for Fang Qiang first. She couldn’t conceal the excitement in her eyes when she said, “Manager, my client is ready to buy the villa #9. I’ve also negotiated the price with them, as of now…”</p><p>“The villa #9 has been booked out.” Fang Qiang waved his hand to interrupt her and lightly said, “Tell your client to choose from the other three villas.”</p><p>Li Jing was struck dumb and looked at Fang Qiang as if she couldn’t believe what she heard. She had just checked the property booking system a moment ago. Villa #9 was not booked; even the deposit had been confiscated.</p><p>“Are you not mistaken, Manager? I just…”</p><p>“Villa #9 has just been booked out, and I’m not mistaken at all!” Fang Qiang furrowed his brows and said with a displeased expression. “The client who booked villa #9 is Hao Qian’s client, and they will come here in the afternoon to sign the purchase agreement. Alright, if you have no other matters, don’t disturb me anymore.”</p><p>“But manager, our sales department have always employed a persistent policy that whoever pays the money first would be the one who gets the house. If that client has already paid the deposit, then I’ll immediately leave now. But my client has promised to pay up front immediately once they have signed the house purchase agreement. You see…”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
