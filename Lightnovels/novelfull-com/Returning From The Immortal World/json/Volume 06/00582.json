However, he was crystal clear that Yao Qinglong would only bring about his own decimation if he wanted to take revenge on Tang Xiu. Prior to this, he used to have a similar feeling of affection to him as someone from the same root. But after the death of their Master, Yao Qinglong had treated him by hook or by crook and even wanted his life, before he eventually escaped him, causing all the friendship and affection to dry up.</p><p>“Did you forget what I told you before, Qinglong? We are no longer martial brothers. You can do what you want as you have the freedom to do so, but that will have no relationship with me whatsoever. If you have nothing else to say, then I will take my leave.” Then he stood up from the chair, ready to leave.</p><p>Curling up his mouth, Yao Qinglong said, “You know, Junior Brother, it seems like the fortune our Master sent to you before his death is more than I imagined. Even 100 million is not enough to move you.”</p><p>With a drastic change in expression, Yang Le angrily said, “All the things left behind by Master were acquired by myself—my own abilities. You don’t need to concern yourself with your trifling skills.”</p><p>The expression on Yao Qinglong’s face changed into that of indifference as he replied lightly, “That Old Geezer calculated that we could never obtain them, so he left that kind of training to you, huh? Hmph… He’s dead already, and his things must be equally divided. Of course, I’ll never mention it again if you help me snatch the Magnificent Tang Corporation's products’ formulas this time. I will even give some compensation to Second and Third Brothers so as to make them give up. How about it?”</p><p>“Keep dreaming!” Yang Le scornfully rebuked loudly. “I, Yang Le, may be afraid of anything else, but not threats. I used to see us as martial bothers before; I even let go of the matter of you trying to kill me. But don’t blame me for being ruthless and forget the past friendship if you dare to strike at me again!”</p><p>Yao Qinglong couldn’t help but burst into laughter, “What the hell are you talking about, Junior Brother? How could I, your Senior Brother, scheme to murder you?! I won’t force you to do something if you really don’t want to. Anyhow, you can go deal with your things! When the Second and Third arrive, we’ll straightly head to Bluestar Villa to have a drink with you.”</p><p>While clenching his fists, killing intent flashed out of Yang Le’s eyes. Since Yao Qinglong knew where he lived, it meant that they had investigated him. It was clearly a threat. They were highly likely to point their blades at him if he didn’t help them.</p><p>“Look at your face, Junior Brother. You seem like you don’t welcome us, hmm?” Yao Qinglong smilingly said. “I think you should sit still and continue chatting with me if you don’t want us to do so. Maybe you’ll change your mind after a while!”</p><p>“I will never change my mind—not a chance!” Yang Le said coldly. “Of course, visit me if you want, and I’ll welcome you warmly. I only wish that you won’t die.”</p><p>Having said that, he turned around and walked outside the café, as Yao Qinglong’s smiling face froze.</p><p>Bam…</p><p>Yao Qinglong slapped the table as he watched Yang Le’s back disappear. Killing intent surged inside him. Brat, you have no idea of death or danger, eh? Then I’ll make you suffer, and we’ll see whether you can continue to persist in the face of death.</p><p>****</p><p>Japan, on the summit of Fujiyama.</p><p>Kuwako Yamamoto was sitting cross-legged under a cherry tree while embracing a katana. She was wearing a black exercise suit and let the drizzle wet her hair.</p><p>Whoosh…</p><p>A ghostly figure silently appeared in front of her and then knelt on her knee. The figure was a woman with white hair in front of her forehead, as she reported respectfully, “Young Lady, the item has been obtained and is on the way here. It will be delivered tomorrow morning at the latest.”</p><p>Kuwako suddenly opened her eyes with a pleasantly surprised look in her eyes, as she then replied in satisfaction, “They did a good job. That item doesn’t have much use for me, but for… all right, tell them to not leave any trace.”</p><p>“Understood!”</p><p>The woman in ninja attire replied. Her body swayed and disappeared from the spot.</p><p>A smile finally appeared on Kuwako’s face as she spoke, “Hanako, help me reserve a flight ticket to China, Shanghai. Also, inform my father that I’m going to China to continue negotiating the cooperation issues with the Magnificent Tang Corporation.”</p><p>“Affirmative!” A voice came from behind the tree, as calmness followed shortly after.</p><p>****</p><p>Shanghai, Bluestar Villa Complex.</p><p>When Yang Le returned, he found that he was being tailed. He didn’t head straight to Tang Xiu’s place but returned to Villa #11. He then walked to his bedroom’s window and observed the situation outside before taking out his mobile to call Tang Xiu.</p><p>“Are you back already?” Tang Xiu’s voice was heard from the mobile phone.</p><p>“Tang Xiu, I need your help,” said Yang Le.</p><p>“Tell me! What is it?” Asked Tang Xiu.</p><p>“I’m afraid that Yao Qinglong, Du Yanghe, and Qiu Jian are going to attack me tonight. I hope you can kill them for me,” said Yang Le.</p><p>“Why do they want to kill you?” Tang Xiu raised his brows. “Also, how come they know that you live here?”</p><p>“Yao Qinglong must have sent some people to investigate my whereabouts. I always move covertly in Shanghai, but I’ve been staying here for too long, and investigating it would be easy given their abilities. Anyhow, I also have found out Yao Qinglong’s purpose in seeking me. They want my help in stealing the formulas of the several products belonging to the Magnificent Tang Corporation. I flatly rejected,” said Yang Le.</p><p>“I see!” Tang Xiu immediately hung up after saying that.</p><p>Originally, he wasn’t in a rush to remove Yao Qinglong. He had never seen Yao Qinglong’s Dao abilities, though the man was a disciple of Thief Branch. Given that he actually wanted to attack the Magnificent Tang Corporation to steal their products’ formulas, that was something that could not be forgiven. Those formulas were the capital he relied on to make money, and his loss would be too great if Yao Qinglong were to steal them.</p><p>“You refused the path to heaven, and to the gate of hell shall you be thrown on your own accord!”</p><p>Tang Xiu sneered and then contacted Chi Nan. Though his strength was very formidable, some fish may escape if too many people came from the other party. Therefore, he needed the experts from the Everlasting Feast Hall to lay out an inescapable net. Even if the other party sent a lot of masters, they must never be allowed to return!</p><p>****</p><p>In the previous café.</p><p>Yao Qinglong had not left yet, and sat quietly on the chair while savoring his coffee. He was silently thinking of something. The reason he first straightly headed to Shanghai after returning to China was not that he didn’t care about the present situation the Yao Family was in, but because he didn’t want to expose himself.</p><p>The Yao Family was very important. But that was because the previous Yao Family who could bring him some benefits. As of now, the Yao Family was akin to a stray dog, and the entire foundation of the family was likely stolen by others. From the intelligence he gathered, he was aware of the fact that it may not take long before Beijing would no longer have a Yao Family.</p><p>All of this was not important to him, however. What was more important was the formulas of those several products belonging to the Magnificent Tang Corporation. His return this time was with this difficult mission at hand.</p><p>“Senior Brother! (Senior Brother!)”</p><p>Two voices came from a distance, as Du Yanghe and Qiu Jian appeared in front of Yao Qinglong with smiling faces. Though these three martial brothers each had his own ax to grind and had their own schemes in mind, yet they seemingly got along with each other harmoniously on the surface.</p><p>Yao Qinglong got up and hugged them both as he motioned for them to sit on the other side of the sofa. Then he laughed and said, “You two came fast.”</p><p>“Senior Brother, you summoned us, so it’s natural for us to seize the time and catch up,” said Du Yanghe smilingly. “Anyhow, what about that brat, Yang Le? Didn’t you say that you were going to see him in advance?”</p><p>“That brat didn’t want to be associated with us. He simply flung his face away and left.” Yang Le sneered.</p><p>“He’s just refusing a toast only to be forced to drink a forfeit, I think.” Du Yanghe scornfully murmured. “Senior Brother, I’ll kill him today as long as you command it. Besides, that brat must have taken all the fortunes our Master left behind. We weren’t able to kill him last time, so I haven’t vented out the bottled up anger inside me.”</p><p>“Let’s look for him. If he doesn’t take out all the fortunes left by Master, then let’s just kill him.” Qiu Jian echoed. “I refuse to believe that he would rather keep all the wealth and doesn’t give a damn care to his own life, no?”</p><p>“Don’t worry. It’s not suitable for us to act in broad daylight now. Besides, I’ve already sent people to find his tracks. I’m sure that he just wants to escape now, and can’t shake off my informers,” said Yao Qinglong with a chuckle. “Anyhow, I’ll tell you the main purpose for your coming here. I need to get the formulas of the products of the Magnificent Tang Corporation. I’ll give each one of you 100 million yuan if you help me get them.”</p><p>Du Yanghe and Qiu Jian exchanged looks. Shocked expressions appeared on their faces. What shocked them the most was not because they had to steal the formulas of the Magnificent Tang Corporation’s products, but the compensation promised by Yao Qinglong.</p><p>100 million?</p><p>Even if they were both disciples of Thief Branch and also possessed good abilities and had their own businesses, the total wealth they had in hands was probably less than 100 million yuan.</p><p>“What a big deal, Senior Brother!” Du Yanghe exclaimed.</p><p>“A great deal indeed,” said Yao Qinglong with a chuckle. “The buyer is willing to pay 400 million yuan, and I originally intended to divide it equally between the four of us. But that brat, Yang Le, turned out to reject me.”</p><p>“It must be because the fortune left by Master is quite a lot!” Du Yanghe scornfully commented. “Else he would never ignore or be moved by this amount of money! Senior Brother, we must kill Yang Le to get the fortune left by Master. 40% will be yours, and we’ll take 30% each at that time.”</p><p>Yao Qinglong secretly jeered at him, yet he let out a satisfied smile on the surface, saying, “Well, since you agreed with the share, then welcome aboard. If Yang Le is willing to help me steal those products’ formulas, however, we must not attack him before the operation is over. We’ll only kill him after.”</p><p>“No problem!” Du Yanghe and Qiu Jian were as though seeing a huge fortune waving to them as they nodded in contentment.</p><p>They had long coveted the wealth left by their Master, but their strength was unfortunately under Yang Le’s. Eventually, they weren’t able to see even the shadow of a dime from that wealth. As long as they were able to kill Yang Le and get that wealth, they were pretty sure that even a 30% share would be equal to the pay promised by Yao Qinglong.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
