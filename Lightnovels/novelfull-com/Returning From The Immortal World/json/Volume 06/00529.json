Then, hesitating, he didn’t call in the end.</p><p>He then turned to the three girls and said, “What are you girls going to do next? I have something to deal with, so I may not be able to accompany you.”</p><p>Mu Wanying was in a very good mood at this time. Even if she was just Tang Xiu’s nominal girlfriend, she believed that as long as she put up a persistent effort, becoming his real girlfriend wouldn’t be a problem in the future. Thus, she squeezed out a very dazzling, beautiful smile and tenderly said, “Then we’ll go back to our dorm! So let’s leave together.”</p><p>“Okay!” Tang Xiu picked up the books and put them back on its original shelfs. He then selected a few books and registered them at the office, before he left the library with Mu Wanying’s group. Their departure attracted much attention, but no one dared to come forward to strike up a conversation.</p><p>However, fearing that Lian Kang would lash out his anger at them, Tang Xiu escorted the three girls right until the downstairs of the female students’ dormitory.</p><p>“All right, then we’ll go upstairs first!” Jiang Feiyan winked at Mu Wanying, as she grinned and dragged Li Xinjie toward the front door of the dormitory building. Mu Wanying let out a low chuckle, as she calmly looked at Tang Xiu and said, “I know you are very busy, but you should also pay attention to your health. If there’s anything I can do for you, call me immediately.”</p><p>“Relax! I’ll take good care of myself,” said Tang Xiu with a smile.</p><p>Suddenly, Mu Wanying stepped forward and lifted her hand to fix Tang Xiu’s collar that was not too neat. Under everyone’s stupefied gazes, she said with a smile, “I may be your fake girlfriend, but we still have to look intimate in public. I think that if you hug me now, that will send a very clear message to the male students who have been harassing me, and then everyone will learn that I already belong to a man.”</p><p>Tang Xiu was hesitant, and then glanced at the surrounding. A forced smile appeared on his handsome face as he gently held Mu Wanying in his arms, feeling her delicate and gentle body heat, and then said, “Is it all right now?”</p><p>Mu Wanying hugged Tang Xiu back. This time, she used her strength and kept hugging going for more than 20 seconds before she reluctantly released Tang Xiu and chuckled, “Yeah, it should be fine now.”</p><p>“All right then, I’m leaving!” Tang Xiu turned and walked away while waving at her.</p><p>Mu Wanying stood there with a very sweet smile, with dimples appearing on her; a classical beauty. Her smiling face that was full of joyous mood could be seen by many people there, arousing the envy and jealousy of the girls yet making the boys brokenhearted.</p><p>However, the most heartbreaking scene for the male students was not the hug nor her happy smile, but the scene of Mu Wanying staring at the back of Tang Xiu as he departed, until he disappeared at the end of the trail in the far distance, as well the reluctance and unwillingness on her face before she turned around and walked toward the dormitory building.</p><p>“The First Belle of Shanghai University, Mu Wanying has fallen in love with the celebrity student, Tang Xiu!”</p><p>After this news appeared on the Shanghai University forum, the news went viral and only took one hour before all the students, teachers, professors and leaders at Shanghai University to learn about it.</p><p>In a flash, slander and critic began to flood the comments section of the campus forum by numerous male students, all of which were bombarding Tang Xiu. Many of the commentaries were full of profane words and insults. At the same time, Mu Wanying was also ridiculed by a lot of people, particularly by the male students who failed to get her attention. Certainly, there also appeared many commentaries from people who respected and admired Tang Xiu, saying that it was ‘a perfect match’ between a beauty and a hero.</p><p>Eventually, after several hours, there were two opposing sides on the campus forum. One side was the hater students and those trolling with anonymous account, and the other one was the students who straightforwardly supported Tang Xiu and Mu Wanying.</p><p>Put shortly, the Shanghai University forum turned very lively.</p><p>Tang Xiu, who was one of the main characters of the story, had left Shanghai University at this time and was inside the study room of his villa. He was currently focused on drawing a architectural design. He had previously made an agreement with Jin Xingkui that he would hand over the design to him, yet he hadn’t had the time to finish it due to various issues, as well as having his time spent manufacturing various charms after he returned from Beijing. Fortunately, Jin Xingkui wasn’t in a hurry since he was still engaged in the preparation for the early stage of the project.</p><p>As dusk came, Tang Xiu finally put down the paint brush and pondered for quite a long time. He then took his out mobile phone and dialed Han Qingwu’s cell number. At this time, Han Qingwu was currently reading the comments on campus forum in her rented house. Her face was quite rigid and unsightly, and she kept that expression for more than half an hour.</p><p>Her feelings were quite chaotic, and she couldn’t figure out what was wrong with herself. She didn’t know why she felt like she just lost a very important thing after learning the news that Tang Xiu and Mu Wanying had become lovers. This vexed, edgy, and uncomfortable feeling that overwhelmed her and rendered her helpless frightened her.</p><p>Ring, ring, ring…</p><p>Her mobile phone rang, startling her. When she snapped back to her senses, she then realized that there was a cool sensation on her cheeks. Unknowingly, tears had flowed out of her eyes.</p><p>After grabbing the mobile and looking at the screen, Han Qingwu saw that the caller was Tang Xiu. Her expression looked slightly vacant for a moment, as she wiped off the tears on her face quickly. She then cleared her throat before connecting the call and said, “Han Qingwu speaking.”</p><p>“Teacher Han, if you have some free time tonight, would you like to have dinner with me?”</p><p>“No, I don’t have time!” The moment Han Qingwu heard Tang Xiu’s voice, anger suddenly boiled inside her heart, and it was also reflected in her voice.</p><p>“Have I provoked you recently, Teacher Han? Why are you angry with me?” Asked Tang Xiu with a wry tone.</p><p>“Is that your business?” Blurted out Han Qingwu.</p><p>Tang Xiu was silent for a moment, as he then replied in a wry tone, “Teacher Han, I’m sincerely inviting you to dinner, though I don’t know why your mood isn’t good. If you really don’t have time, then forget about it. I’ll invite you some other day. All right, then I’ll hang…”</p><p>“Where is it?” Feeling that Tang Xiu was going hang up, Han Qingwu hurriedly asked, yet she immediately regretted it.</p><p>“Come to the Everlasting Feast Hall! I’ll be there waiting for you,” said Tang Xiu.</p><p>“En!” Han Qingwu replied as she hung up the phone directly.</p><p>She didn’t understand what was happening to her at this moment, and why she couldn’t control her emotions when facing Tang Xiu.</p><p>Had she fallen in love with him? Or is it because of jealousy?</p><p>Han Qingwu thought that it was indeed that, yet she felt that it wasn’t entirely correct as well. She felt that ever since she heard Tang Xiu’s song and zither play at the Shanghai University’s freshmen welcoming party, as well as after those images kept appearing inside her mind, Tang Xiu’s importance became more prominent in her heart all of a sudden. Even without her realizing, she often thought and missed Tang Xiu; his face, his every move, word, and smile.</p><p>Why would those pictures keep appearing inside my mind? I’ve lived for more than 20 years and I have never once encountered anything like in those pictures whatsoever. I shouldn’t have that kind of memories at all, but why?</p><p>Han Qingwu rubbed her head. Amid a headache, she suddenly remembered that Tang Xiu invited her to dinner tonight. In a flash, she bounced up from the sofa and dashed into the cloakroom at a speed beyond the limits of an ordinary person.</p><p>At the Everlasting Feast Hall…</p><p>Inside the deluxe box on the third floor, Tang Xiu was sitting and immersing himself in his thoughts while drinking tea and smoking a cigarette. In the past two weeks, despite the fact that his days were quite busy every day, he still couldn’t fulfill what he had promised on some business deals, though those issues had been finished as of now.</p><p>Ring, ring, ring…</p><p>His mobile phone interrupted his train of thought, as Tang Xiu grabbed it and saw that the number was from an unfamiliar Beijing number. He creased his brows and immediately pressed the answer button and said, “Tang Xiu speaking, may I know who am I speaking with?”</p><p>“Hello, Grandmaster Tang. It’s Situ Chao here. I and someone from the Jinmen and Li Families have arrived in Shanghai. Where are you? We’re looking for you now!”</p><p>Tang Xiu pondered for a moment and slowly said, “Take care of your accommodations first. I’m currently having dinner with someone. After I’m done with it, I’ll come over to you and bring what you need.”</p><p>“No, no. How can we dare to make Grandmaster Tang come to find us? How about you tell us a place to go and we’ll wait for you there?” Said Situ Chao hastily.</p><p>After hesitating, Tang Xiu replied, “Then head to the Bluestar Villa Complex! I live in villa #9 there. I’ll be back as fast as possible.”</p><p>“All right!”</p><p>After the phone call ended, Tang Xiu shook his head and smiled. Just as he was still thinking as to when those three parties from the Occult Sect would come to Shanghai to get their stuff they suddenly arrive. However, he just invited Han Qingwu to dinner, so he couldn’t ignore her just like that, or else it would be quite hopeless for him if he were to ask her for help later.</p><p>In the front counter on the first floor.</p><p>While holding a smile, Chi Nan cheerfully greeted the arriving and departing guests. When Han Qingwu, donned in casual attire, came inside, Chi Nan discovered that she had obviously put on makeup, which intensified her beauty.</p><p>“You’re here, Teacher Han!”</p><p>“Tang Xiu told me to come find him here. He should already be here, right?” Han Qingwu said with a faint smile.</p><p>“The Boss is here and has been waiting for you in the box on the third floor. I’ll lead you upstairs!” Chi Nan smilingly replied.</p><p>“Thank you!” Han Qingwu nodded and thanked her.</p><p>“Please don’t be so polite, Teacher Han,” said Chi Nan with a smile. “You’re a friend of our Boss, so entertaining you well is my duty. Anyways, you look so gorgeous today, Teacher Han.”</p><p>Han Qingwu dazed, and her beautiful face slightly blushed. When she remembered that she put on makeup, she nearly covered her face. She suppressed her awkwardness and squeezed out a smile, “Thank you, Manager Chi, you too look very beautiful today.”</p><p>“Nah, I’m not that good. I’m an old woman already,” said Chi Nan with a smile. “If I were at your age, I would’ve definitely taken Boss’ heart from you.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
