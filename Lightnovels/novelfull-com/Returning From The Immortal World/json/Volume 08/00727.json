Other than the different attire, the looks and figure were identical, so it was absolutely Han Qingwu. The duo recalled the time when they tried to talk to her, and as they thought about how mistaken their actions were, they were so scared that they nearly wet their pants.</p><p>“Gulp… it feels so good to be alive.” Chen Shuai’s throat squirmed, and his trembling right hand wiped off the cold sweat on his forehead. He was afraid to even imagine what would happen if Han Qingwu were to hit them back in the Red Pavilion. Even if they did not die, they would be left only half alive!</p><p>Zhou Chong, on the other hand, unfastened his buttons as though wanting to unleash the depression pressing his chest. Though Ji Mu slapped him a few times and made him regret that he should not have annoyed Han Qingwu, he regretted it the most at this moment. It was because those who could participate in the underground fighting match all the way down to the finals were absolutely not people he could afford to provoke.</p><p>“Chen Shuai, I was a bit resentful towards Ji Mu previously, but now… I can’t find myself to hate him… I’m even feeling very grateful.”</p><p>“Yeah, me too.”</p><p>Chen Shuai nodded with lingering fear inside as he recalled he had annoyed Han Qingwu. If she wanted to beat them both, wouldn’t they be dead already?</p><p>On the stage.</p><p>Black Widow smiled after introducing the four fighters, and then summoned a beautiful girl, took a sealed box from her and placed it in the center of the ring. She then smiled and said, “There are four cards in this box. Two Great Kings and two Small Kings. Each fighter will draw one, the matches will be Small King vs. Small King and Great King vs. Great King. The winner of each match will then fight in the final.”</p><p>It was a lottery, a very fair grouping method, so the four fighters did not object to it. The result came out soon. Han Qingwu and Savage Beast Li Tong drew Small King cards, whereas Ironfist Jin Can and Ladyboy Wu Tong drew Great King cards.</p><p>After Black Widow announced the pairing matches, the four fighters went to the backstage to prepare themselves. The first round would be the Small Kings and the second match would be the Great Kings. The Small King match would start at 8:30 and the fighters had 20 minutes to prepare.</p><p>In the audience, Li Laoshan gazed at the back of Han Qingwu as she left and lightly furrowed his brows. He really could not figure out why Tang Xiu would choose Han Qingwu. He had seen her fighting in more than ten matches and had some estimation in regards to her combat prowess. She was not by any means weak, since her strength and speed could be said to be one of the best. And yet, she exposed her biggest flaw during the competition… she was too kind.</p><p>The underground fighting match was the kind of fight where the fighters’ moves would either be to inflict injury or to kill, but the most serious injuries Han Qingwu inflicted on her opponents in her several matches were only breaking several of their ribs or dislocating their arms. That was when she was forced into a miserable state, so she didn’t have a choice but to go all out.</p><p>“Brother Tang…”</p><p>Li Laoshan did not want to spend 100 million of his own money for naught, so he hesitated and shouted—a shout that carried his regret. At this time, he was questioning Tang Xiu with an ugly expression.</p><p>Tang Xiu glanced at him and lightly smiled, “Relax! She promised me to win this game. She’ll become the champion even if she has to pay the price, that’s for sure.”</p><p>“You know Han Qingwu?” Asked Li Laoshan, startled and astounded.</p><p>“I came here with her this time, else I wouldn’t have known there was an underground fighting competition,” explained Tang Xiu.</p><p>Li Laoshan’s unsettled and fidgety heart immediately turned at ease as he rubbed his hands and grinned. “Well, then I can rest my heart easy since she came with you, Brother Tang. Losing money is just a trivial matter, but I’m hella sure Old Chu will laugh at me.”</p><p>Chu Xuecheng frowned, and there was solemn look in his eyes. He really could not understand why Li Laoshan trusted Tang Xiu so much.</p><p>8:30.</p><p>Han Qingwu, still donning her original attire, a black training suit, valiantly entered the ring from the backstage. Her expression was cold, and there was neither dread nor contempt when she saw the fierce and cruel-looking Li Tong. Her eyes swept past Tang Xiu and then landed on the host, Black Widow.</p><p>Black Widow did not waste any more time as she immediately announced the start of the fight and left the ring. If it was a regular boxing match, the referee would stay in the ring and use the so-called rules to restrain the boxer, but the underground fighting match had no rules. One could use any means, however shameless they were, once they stepped onto the ring. They were even allowed to use any weapons but firearms.</p><p>Li Tong smacked his lips when he stared at Han Qingwu and grinned hideously, “Ice Phoenix Han Qingwu. Encountering such a beauty like you in the underground fighting arena is really a rare occasion. Nevertheless, I, Li Tong, will have mercy on you if you admit defeat now.”</p><p>“Spare the bullshit, let’s just prove it through our fists,” said Han Qingwu coldly.</p><p>“Disregarding dangers and having no idea of death, eh?” Li Tong evilly grinned. “Fine. Don’t blame me for destroying your beauty with a heavy blow.”</p><p>Han Qingwu did not respond, as her elegant stature dashed and instantly appeared in front of Li Tong in the blink of an eye, the True Essence in her body surging and circulating through the meridians all over her body.</p><p>Hmph…</p><p>Li Tong didn’t have the slightest worry. He was very excited after getting paired with Han Qingwu. He had watched all her fights in the competition. He knew that although this woman had quite the speed and strength, she was actually very soft hearted. If he were to fight the others and win the match, it would probably a hard earned victory, but he did not have to worry about being injured heavily and being unable to fight in the next match as long as he won against Han Qingwu.</p><p>As his toes stepped on the floor, his legs made a tight stance and swept a kick in a flash. As his body soared and the moment Han Qingwu avoided it, the shadows of his legs joined together and delivered continuous kicks at Han Qingwu.</p><p>BAM…</p><p>After a dozen of seconds of strikes, Han Qingwu’s arm was finally hit once, but amidst the pain, Han Qingwu’s body swayed and she instantly delivered a kick at Li Tong’s calf.</p><p>“DIE!”</p><p>Li Tong did not want to have a long fight because there was still another match. After that brief counter strike, he did not want to take a cheap loss, suddenly arousing his savageness. His body was like a hungry tiger as he sent a barrage of punches at Han Qingwu’s head. In a flash moment after, his right hand grabbed a dagger from his waist. He was confident that as long as Han Qingwu dared to block his heavy punch, he could then strike her head with this dagger.</p><p>A cold light flashed in Han Qingwu’s eyes. Upon seeing Li Tong use a weapon, she knew that this guy wanted to kill her. She immediately kicked her foot on the floor and made a dash backward. Her palm slapped Li Tong’s fist while her left hand’s finger pierced his armpit.</p><p>Puff…</p><p>As the trajectory of Li Tong’s fist deviated, the downard stabbing dagger also instantly shifted. The rugged dagger swept the hair on Han Qingwu’s temple, but his body suddenly trembled and a clearly visible wound appeared at his armpit. No one was able to notice that a spurt of True Essence was shot out the moment Han Qingwu’s finger pierced Li Tong’s armpit and then pierced the acupoint in the wound.</p><p>As his body flipped over, the heavy hammering came.</p><p>As Li Tong’s body trembled, Han Qingwu had already done a complete set of smooth flowing movements that only showed white and delicate fists barraging the left side of Li Tong’s neck.</p><p>Crack…</p><p>Despite having a hard iron-like body, Li Tong’s neck was broken as though it was smashed by stone by Han Qingwu’s fists. As the sound of the broken bones echoed, his large body flew up for five-plus meters before it heavily fell on the platform.</p><p>“What’s going on?”</p><p>“How is this possible?”</p><p>“This…”</p><p>In the auditorium, the rich men who placed their wagers on Li Tong’s win had drastic changes in expression and could not bear shouting. They did not see his heavy punch destroying the belle, and neither did they see him shedding the exquisite peony’s blood or hacking her in half…</p><p>In the back row, a smile painted Tang Xiu’s handsome face. He also felt somewhat surprised, as he did not expect that Han Qingwu could actually shoot her True Essence out. She was evidently at the Peak of Qi Refining Stage, but her being able to achieve this was really a bit unexpected.</p><p>However, it was her win, an easy one.</p><p>Li Laoshan suddenly turned to look at Tang Xiu and said in pleasant surprise, “How come Han Qingwu be so strong? Less than half a minute passed and she already won?”</p><p>“She has been trained by a specialist, and what she learned was nothing but killing moves,” said Tang Xiu with a smile. “But still, she is not a bloodthirsty killer and maybe, she has yet to unleash everything she has in her previous fights. In fact, that Li Tong is quite a powerful man, and his strength and speed can’t be compared to ordinary martial arts grandmasters. Only, he underestimated Han Qingwu’s strength as well as her determination. In actuality, he could have lasted for some time and would be even less likely to fall by the edge of the sword if he did not pull out his dagger.”</p><p>Li Laoshan blinked and instantly understood Tang Xiu’s explanation. This Savage Beast Li Tong just created a death path for himself!</p><p>At the side.</p><p>Chu Xuecheng had an unsightly expression. Although the one he placed his wager on was the Ladyboy Wu Tong, yet the combat prowess demonstrated by Han Qingwu was beyond his expectations. He was a martial artist himself, and even though his ability was not as good as Li Laoshan’s, he still had keen and sharp eyes.</p><p>Who would have thought that Han Qingwu, the one he felt less optimistic about, unexpectedly won the match and directly killed Savage Beast Li Tong? What surprised him the most was how easy it was for her to defeat him. It seemed that not even half a minute had yet to pass from the beginning to the end.</p><p>Don’t tell me Han Qingwu will really become the champion?</p><p>He glanced at Li Laoshan and even looked at Tang Xiu. After having observed them for a long time, a bitter smile was cast on his face and he secretly shook his head.</p><p>The fighting match was not over yet, and he did not want to see this result. So he secretly cheered for Ladyboy Wu Tong to pass through. The others may not have noticed, but Ladyboy Wu Tong had yet to unleash his full power as well, something he was clear about.</p><p>He once saw him in action outside the underground fighting arena. Back then, this shemale was simply a berserk deity.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
