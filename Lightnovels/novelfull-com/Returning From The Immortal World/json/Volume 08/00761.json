Bowing her head, her eyes were open and flashed with incredible lights.</p><p>Ice?</p><p>Her legs were frozen by ice? The ice was spreading upward at a terrible speed? How could it be? Weren’t the enemies cultivators? Were there any Talented Adepts among the cultivators?</p><p>“Poof…”</p><p>A light of sword flashed by, the female Talented Adept’s neck was cut off in an instant. Her vision was churning and she could see her headless body spraying blood.</p><p>Slaughter!</p><p>It was also a massacre!</p><p>Except for Siou and his three fellows, more than a dozen Talented Adepts were killed in just two or three minutes. As for Tang Xiu’s men, only Jin Shi had a gash in his arm, others fought to the end without a scratch.</p><p>“What the hell is this place?”</p><p>Being aware of the bizarre situation in the Four Phenomena Formation, Siou attacked desperately, only to trigger shafts of lightning and fail to destroy everything. What he saw was his men were being killed and all he could do was to strike back, which made him incapable of helping others.</p><p>“Brother Siou, initiate the blood incantation.”</p><p>Stumbling to dodge several flying swords, that adorable girl took out a piece of paper spell from her arms and shouted.</p><p>In an instant.</p><p>Siou and the other two men took out pieces of paper spell too. When they activated the paper spell with talents, a quaint and strange atmosphere burst out. The intense light of blood fused and formed a bloody storm.</p><p>In the formation’s eye.</p><p>Tang Xiu’s eyes suddenly contracted, and after feeling the violent power, he immediately used the Four Phenomena Formation to roll up Mo Awu and others. As his body retreated crazily, everyone had withdrawn from the Four Phenomena Formation. And even at the time when Tang Xiu retreated, he suddenly felt that the Four Phenomena Formation cracked, and then it was broken by the bloody storm.</p><p>“WOW…”</p><p>Four figures rushed out of the broken Four Phenomena Formation, but at the moment when they sprinted, a bloody fog spurted from their mouths. Then the four people were thrown to the ground hundreds of meters away.</p><p>Having a lingering fear, Tang Xiu watched the place where the Four Phenomena Formation was arranged. For hundreds of meters, the surrounding area was bombarded with a large pit, of which the depth was more than two meters. He couldn’t imagine how many people could survive if he had retreated a few seconds later?</p><p>“Is this the power of the blood incantation?”</p><p>In Tang Xiu’s eyes, the killing sense became more intense. Like a lightning, he rushed toward the four including Siou. And as the four had just jumped up, the sword was sacrificed by him and he squatted it toward the four.</p><p>“BOOM…”</p><p>In a hurry, the four arranged their defense, but they fell apart under the sword’s power, and the sword qi smashed them out dozens of meters away, falling to the ground again.</p><p>This time.</p><p>Except for Siou, who was still able to struggle to get up, the other three had got faint.</p><p>“PU! PU! PU!”</p><p>The sword light flashed, and the three fainted Talented Adepts were killed. While Siou, who kept the sword power out for a while, was chopped into two halves by Feng Yang who drilled out of the ground.</p><p>Everything ended.</p><p>Looking at the scene after the battle and Mo Awu and others who sprinted, Tang Xiu nodded with satisfaction and said, “We killed all enemies before their identity could be uncovered. It’s interesting. Feng Yang, you stay with me, the others, immediately clean up the mess.”</p><p>Feng Yang drifted closer to Tang Xiu and whispered with his eyes rolled, “Boss, do you want to arrange traps?”</p><p>Tang Xiu was confused, “What do you mean?”</p><p>Feng Yang said: “Now we kill all these people though, there must be someone more powerful behind them. If we disguise the scene, we can misdirect them that all this is caused by the Stygian Club. The two forces may at war.”</p><p>Tang Xiu raised his hand and touched his chin, he said thoughtfully: “You mean… impute the responsibility to others?”</p><p>Feng Yang nodded and said: “Yes, that’s it. Since the Stygian Club and we are at daggers drawn, then we can add one more enemy to them. These people killed by us are all Talented Adepts. If we also use talents and create some hints, then we can throw the vampires’ body there, I think that the one behind the Talented Adept will direct against the Stygian Club.”</p><p>Tang Xiu’s eyes shone and said with a smile, “It seems that my subordinates are indeed talented! Feng Yang, your advice is good, just do it.”</p><p>Feng Yang asked, “Boss, you ask me to stay, is there any order?”</p><p>Tang Xiu waved his hand and said, “Forget it for the time being. You should arrange the trap with others first. After half an hour, let’s enter the mountains.”</p><p>Half an hour later.</p><p>When everything was arranged well, Tang Xiu took everyone to the place where the white mist shrouded. Although his divine sense was released, he cannot penetrate the white mist. Like a viscous substance, the white mist in front of them had a strong barrier power to the divine consciousness.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
