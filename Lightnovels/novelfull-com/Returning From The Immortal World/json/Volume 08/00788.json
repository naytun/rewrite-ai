Let’s go!”</p><p>Gu Yan’er loosened Tang Xiu and clung to his arm with a satisfied expression. Whether it was Zhenlei Duomo or those that she had fostered and trained, all of them were not as important as her Master, Tang Xiu. She could live and survive up till now due to him.</p><p>Hundreds of meters away, dozens of men and women in black suits and similar sunglasses stood in front of a row of black cars. Even though there were many people around, they could only stop and stay hundreds of meters away.</p><p>Zhenlei Duomo was following behind Tang Xiu and Gu Yan’er. When she saw those dozens of people, her pupils suddenly contracted and her muscles tightened as she could see some familiar faces among them.</p><p>Previously, she was also one who was born overseas and faced many perils, risking her life countless times. She had fought many people on the battlefield and climbed up from the heaps of the dead. Those familiar faces were also experts she had once encountered; each and every one of them was the strongest who also survived from the heap of those dead corpses.</p><p>Yet there was something she couldn’t figure out. How come these people appeared here?</p><p>Zhenlei slowed down her pace and asked in a whisper to Mo Awu who caught up to her pace, “How come Darknight Lord, Bloodthirsty Serpent, and Golden Bat are also here? Don’t tell me they are also like you as members of the Everlasting Feast Hall and cultivators?”</p><p>“Might as well tell you now since you’re one of us,” replied Mo Awu indifferently. “They are indeed members of Everlasting Feast Hall, our core members. Not only those three but also the rest of them.”</p><p>Zhenlei trembled and looked terrified. She thought that the Everlasting Feast Hall only had 11 cultivators including Mo Awu, all of whom were Tang Xiu’s men. It seemed that she was completely mistaken. A little more than two decades ago, the Everlasting Feast Hall’s people were already powerful and invincible with Gu Yan’er at the helm. Yet now, it suddenly had dozens of powerful cultivators. How terrifyingly powerful was this Everlasting Feast Hall exactly?</p><p>“Brother Awu, how many cultivators does the Everlasting Feast Hall have? Is everyone here as strong as you?”</p><p>A smile was sketched in the corner of Mo Awu’s mouth. “The Everlasting Feast Hall has a lot of cultivators; even I can’t tell the number. The person who would know about that should be Little Boss, but it seems like she doesn’t come here. However, they should come, though.”</p><p>“They? Who are they?” asked Zhenlei Duomo, confused.</p><p>“I’ll tell you that you have very good luck you know,” said Mo Awu. “The previous Boss actually accepted you as a disciple and made all of us very envious. The people I told you about are your Senior Brother and Sister. Do you see the only person who’s wearing white attire over there? His name is Light, and since he appears here, Dark must be nearby as well.”</p><p>“Are they very powerful?” asked Zhenlei Duomo again.</p><p>“It’s a wide gap comparing us with them, if you ask me,” answered Mo Awu seriously. “Even you are far inferior to them.”</p><p>Zhenlei Duomo fell into silence. She was not an arrogant woman and was actually very smart. Even though she had not known Mo Awu for a long time, she could also see that Mo Awu wasn’t someone full of hot air. Since this guy was very sure that those people were stronger than her, what he said was likely true.</p><p>The ‘Everlasting Feast Hall!’</p><p>A complex expression could be seen on her face. The more she thought about it, the more she felt that the Everlasting Feast Hall had unfathomable power. Yet inside she still felt glad that she had successfully joined this organization.</p><p>Suddenly, she seemed to recall something and quickly asked, “Brother Awu, Grand Master said that I must give a year of resource quota to Shui Gui as compensation. Exactly how much does the Everlasting Feast Hall give us annually?”</p><p>“Are you asking about money?”</p><p>Mo Awu stared at her with a strange expression before replying, “Core members of Everlasting Feast Hall care little for wealth. It’s very easy for us to obtain if we want money. The resource allocation for our members is, in fact, in the form of medicinal pills, weapons, ancient manuals for magic spells, and cultivation resources that will be helpful for cultivators. These resources allocated by the Everlasting Feast Hall are not something you can ever obtain even if you have trillions. The quantity is not much, but we would have to spend at least 1 billion in terms of money!”</p><p>“Is it really impossible to buy anywhere?” Zhenlei Duomo asked, confused.</p><p>“No outsiders can buy them, only our core members,” explained Mo Awu. “It’s just that, the form of the purchase is different. For example, if we need medicinal pills for cultivation, we can buy medicinal herbs needed to refine them and they can be used to exchange for the medicinal pills. In addition, the quantity of herbs is quite large.”</p><p>Zhenlei Duomo understood in a flash, yet she still asked, “Are those medicinal pills really helpful for our cultivation?”</p><p>“Let me draw an analogy for you,” said Mo Awu. “Your current cultivation has reached Foundation Establishment but you should still be at the early stage. The best medicinal pill for you to take is the Essence Amassing Pill that will allow you to reach the middle of the Foundation Establishment stage five years sooner. In other words, if you need ten years to reach the middle stage from the early stage of Foundation Establishment, then you’ll only need five years to break through if you consume the Essence Amassing Pill.”</p><p>Hiss…</p><p>Zhenlei Duomo sucked in a breath of cold air. What Mo Awu explained shocked her greatly since that kind of medicinal pill was just like the legendary immortal elixir in oriental fables!</p><p>She quickly squinted at the indifferent-looking Shui Gui behind her full of regret. Had she known earlier that the Everlasting Feast Hall possessed such great items, she wouldn’t have easily agreed to pass a year of resource allocation to Shui Gui to write off the enmity between them!</p><p>Jingmen Island, the headquarters of the Everlasting Feast Hall.</p><p>Just as Tang Xiu got out from the car, he could smell a medicinal fragrance in the air. He glanced inside and curiously asked, “Is Ji Chimei currently concocting medicinal pills?”</p><p>“Elder Ji has been constantly busy refining medicinal pills in her place, ever since Xiaoxue returned from Mist Source Island and brought back a lot of precious medicinal ingredients. Previously we only had a small number of medicinal pills in our treasure vault, but we now have plenty thanks to her continuous refinement. I’ve inspected those medicinal ingredients. They are of premium quality and several of them are very difficult to obtain even in the Immortal World. In the next few years, our Everlasting Feast Hall should not be lacking in medicinal pills.”</p><p>“That would be great.” Tang Xiu nodded with a smile.</p><p>Afterward, the duo conversed about a lot of topics, one of which was in regards to Zhenlei Duomo. When Gu Yan’er learned that Zhenlei Duomo had become the second in command of the organized crime syndicate abroad, she cringed and was at a loss whether she should laugh or cry.</p><p>“Master, Grand Master.”</p><p>Similarly donned in a white dress, Gu Xioxue came to greet Gu Yan’er and Tang Xiu respectfully.</p><p>Gu Yan’er looked at her and smilingly asked, “Xiaoxue, how’s Elder Ji’s refinement of that medicinal pill? I asked her to concoct Nine Revolving Souls Pill, has she done with it yet?”</p><p>Gu Xiaoxue extended her hand to pass over a jade bottle and said, “It has been concocted, but only just two pills. Elder Ji said that the herbs to refine Nine Revolving Souls Pill are too rare, so she was only able to refine two of them at the most.”</p><p>“Being able to refine two of them is enough,” Gu Yan’er smiled with satisfaction and said, “Master, these are Nine Revolving Soul Pills. Please take them quickly! These pills will be very helpful for your present cultivation.”</p><p>After receiving the jade bottle, Tang Xiu unplugged the cap and smelled it, nodding as he said, “It’s indeed the Nine Revolving Soul Pill. Countless immortals in the Immortal World would try everything to get this pill, yet, to be honest, I never thought this would have appeared on Earth. However, I have no way to consume this pill for the time being considering my current low cultivation. Also, taking this Nine Revolving Soul pill would not only have no effect on me but is also highly likely to bring some hidden dangers.”</p><p>“Hidden danger? But why?” asked Gu Yan’er quizzically.</p><p>“If I were to take it, I would at least need to enter seclusion for several years to fully absorb all the efficacy within this Nine Revolving Soul pill. If I didn’t, the enormous potency contained within would blast my body from within,” explained Tang Xiu with a wry smile.</p><p>Gu Yan’er stared blankly before she immediately got the gist and said, “Ah, you haven’t condensed your Golden Core yet, Master. It’s because I want to see you become stronger, so that was why I…”</p><p>“No. In any case, my current path of cultivation is different from ordinary cultivators,” interrupted Tang Xiu. “Precisely speaking, the path I’m taking is Demon’s cultivation.”</p><p>“Demon’s cultivation technique? But Master, I cannot sense any Demonic Qi on you?” asked Gu Yan’er, looking puzzled.</p><p>“Do you still remember the Heavenly Art of Cosmic Genesis?” asked Tang Xiu back lightly.</p><p>“That art makes you…” Gu Yan’er’s eyes widened as she said, “You are now shifting to another cultivation technique? But I recall some rumors… that immortals can never cultivate this Heavenly Art of Cosmic Genesis, no?”</p><p>Tang Xiu nodded and said, “Practicing this Heavenly Art of Cosmic Genesis requires extremely harsh conditions, and it was kind of accidental that I just happened to be suitable to cultivate it. Had it been the former me, I wouldn’t have been able to practice this cultivation technique.”</p><p>The explanation made Gu Yan’er instantly understand and she replied with a smile, “Since you would change your cultivation technique, I believe it must be much better compared to the previous one Master. Yan’er really can’t wait to see you return to supremacy in the Immortal World once again.”</p><p>Tang Xiu just smiled in response but no longer talked about the topic again.</p><p>Both Tang Xiu or Gu Yan’er didn’t plan to tell Zhenlei Duomo about the existence of the exquisite pagoda for the time being and arranged her accommodation elsewhere. The both of them then came to the pagoda.</p><p>There the master and disciple spent their days together, reveling in a relaxing and joyful time.</p><p>However, when Tang Xiu suddenly received a reminder note, he remembered that he had promised to send Li Juren some medicinal pills. He didn’t even have the pills refined yet.</p><p>Immediately after receiving the letter, Tang Xiu went to Ji Chimei’s place and began to get busy concocting the pills. After refining the Life Essence Pill, he didn’t rush to see Li Juren but instead sent someone to deliver them. Then just when Tang Xiu received a huge amount of money and was in a good mood, he received a phone call:</p><p>“Let’s meet tomorrow evening at Jingmen Island.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
