That Tang Xiu was evidently a lofty bigshot. Such a powerful figure, would he even accept other’s employment for some money? Unlikely.</p><p>However, after pondering and giving up the idea, Shanjenna cheered up again nonetheless. At least, the feeling of having survived a dire predicament did feel great. She took a deep breath, and then looked at Han Jintong and said with a smile, “I really have to thank you on this one, Professor. Without your protection, I would have been depraved into some medicament and stinking bloody pulp.”</p><p>Han Jintong was thinking about how to obtain more advanced cultivation techniques and how to become a true expert like Tang Xiu. Therefore, he did not pay attention to Shanjenna’s words, perfunctorily replied with “you’re welcome”, and then prepared to lead her out.</p><p>“Umm?”</p><p>Suddenly, Shanjenna curiously shifted her sight toward the depths of the forested mountain, because she saw a burly man who just left with Tang Xiu return.</p><p>Han Jintong was startled by her. After following the direction of her gaze, he then found Jin Shi flying towards them. He arrived in front of them after several breaths, immediately cupping his hands and said, “Is there anything this Brother wants to tell me?”</p><p>“My Boss sent me to ask whether you’re interested to be his guest. If you are, you need to accept two of his requests.”</p><p>“What are the two requests?” Asked Han Jingtong immediately without thinking. He had been dreaming to establish a relationship with Tang Xiu all this while.</p><p>“Firstly, if you are to go with my Boss to some place, and you must follow his instructions and cannot leave without his permission. Secondly, he wants to cooperate with her to perform some experiments.”</p><p>Shanjenna lifted her bloodstained finger to point at her own nose and surprisedly asked, “Your Boss wants to cooperate with me on some experiments? What exactly are them?”</p><p>“I don’t know.” Jin Shi shook his head.</p><p>Han Jintong slightly furrowed his brows. He looked at Shanjenna and then shifted his gaze toward the direction Tang Xiu left, and suddenly asked, “May I ask whether the experiments Tang Xiu wants to perform would injure Shanjenna?”</p><p>“I don’t know about it either.” Jin Shi still shook his head and paused for a moment, and pensively thought before saying, “If my Boss wanted to harm her, he could have already done it before. And I don’t think you could resist either.”</p><p>Han Jintong instantly relaxed. He looked at Shanjenna and said, “You can choose to refuse now, Shanjenna. I’ll still do everything I can to send you out of China. But you can opt to stay here as well, on the premise that you cooperate with Mr. Tang to conduct some experiments. I believe he won’t harm you given his character.”</p><p>“What about Mr. Tang’s place? Is it safe?” Asked Shanjenna cautiously.</p><p>“It should be safer than leaving you alone,” said Han Jintong. “Besides, the Darksoul Scent is currently on you, and if the assassination agents from the Stygian Club keep hunting you, you only have a slim chance to escape. If you opt to stay and wait in Mr. Tang’s place until the Darksoul Scent on you completely dissipates, you can then leave quietly.”</p><p>Shanjenna felt joyous inwardly and nodded with an excited expression, saying, “Alright. Then I choose to stay. As long as Mr. Tang doesn’t harm me, I’m willing to cooperate and conduct the experiments with him.”</p><p>Laoshan Highway.</p><p>Five SUVs were parked on the roadside. Tang Xiu sat in the car in the middle while smoking and watched the young men outside the window, who wore respectful expressions, and spoke to them in satisfaction, “You’ve done a very good job this time. What’s your name?”</p><p>“Wang Ya! (Chen Song!)” The duo replied separately.</p><p>Tang Xiu nodded, “Work hard in the future and strive to assume the highest two posts in Shanghai’s intelligence division. I’m looking forward to seeing you render your service under me in the future.”</p><p>Chen Song and Wang Ya’s eyes lit up and immediately nodded repeatedly with excited expressions.</p><p>Tang Xiu took two porcelain bottles from his interspatial ring, each of which contained a drop of Body Refining Liquid, and threw it to the duo and said, “When you go back home, pour this into your bathtub along with warm water, and then soak yourselves inside. Do remember, however, that no matter how painful it gets you must endure for half an hour. It will give you some benefits.”</p><p>“Thank you, Boss!” The duo held the porcelain bottles with fervent eyes, as though they just had discovered some precious relics.</p><p>When the duo departed, as Tang Xiu had finished smoking, he saw that Jin Shi, with Han Jintong and Shanjenna, had arrived. He did not speak to the two and let them board the car, and then issued an order to leave.</p><p>The reason why he had a sudden change in mind to bring along Han Jintong and Shanjenna back, was because he remembered something. The vampire body he took would definitely have its blood activity weakened, and eventually would lose its activity. But Shanjenna was different since she was a living vampire. Maybe he would gain something if he could study her blood and her organs.</p><p>On the way back, he called Mo Yi and asked the old man to put aside his research and immediately rush to Shanghai alone. Mo Yi was a biologist, and he knew that this man would continue to complete his research on the vampires. And Tang Xiu had a faint expectation about the final result.</p><p>Paradise Manor.</p><p>Tang Xiu did not directly go to the Bluestar Villa Complex but straightly took Han Jintong and Shanjenna to the Paradise Manor, since it was rather convenient to settle them there. Ouyang Lulu who had received a call from Tang Xiu ahead of time and was already waiting in the courtyard in an area of the Paradise Manor that was not open to the public. The area had several foreign-style multi-story buildings, and when the group arrived here, they directly settled Han Jintong and Shanjenna.</p><p>In the living room where Han Jintong just sat down, he saw Tang Xiu watching Shanjenna and scrutinizing her. As an experienced man, he immediately got up and said, “Mr. Tang, I’m injured, so I’ll go to my room to heal myself. Feel free to summon me if you have anything to tell me.”</p><p>Tang Xiu just waved his hand casually and did not look at him at all. His eyes were still full of curiosity, making Shanjenna have some gooseflesh inwardly.</p><p>“T-Tang… Mr. Tang, I-I also must heal me if there’s nothing else,” said Shanjenna immediately after getting up.</p><p>Tang Xiu stopped her. Though Shanjenna’s whole body was battered and scarred, he seemed to be watching her like she was a fine, exquisite object. After Han Jintong’s back disappeared in the hallway, he then took a Holy Healing medicine and threw it at her, saying, “There’s something I’m very curious about. This medicinal pill has a strong healing effect on humans, but I don’t whether it will have the same effect on you. Do you dare to try it?”</p><p>Shanjenna looked at the medicinal pill in her hands. She could smell the medicinal fragrance, and there was an intoxicating look on her pale face. She greedily sucked up several breaths of it, looked at Tang Xiu and asked, “You mean… you want me to take this pill?”</p><p>“That’s right,” said Tang Xiu with a smile.</p><p>Shanjenna threw the Holy Healing medicine into her mouth without hesitation and immediately felt the pill turn into a heat flow that coursed through her whole body after entering her throat. The heat flow current entered her body and then turned into myriad heat flow currents. In just a few breaths, it had already circulated all over her body.</p><p>Warm and comfortable!</p><p>She felt like every pore all over her body stretched out, while the injuries in her body were constantly being healed. Even part of the medicinal efficacy actually merged into her bloodstream and fused into her Core Nucleus. On the surface of her body, all the horrible bleeding open wounds were healed at a speed visible to the naked eye. Her tall and delicate body twitched unceasingly, eventually slumping on the soft sofa and squirming.</p><p>It was so itchy and yet comfortable.</p><p>The contrasting sensations made her feel like she was floating in the clouds. She greedily covered these two sensations, wishing that she could forever indulge within and never wake up again.</p><p>Flap, bang!</p><p>The bones inside Shanjenna’s body sent out a bean-like bursting sound, as her pair of broken wings that were retracted into her body now opened in an instant. Her delicate body slowly floated from the sofa while a particular stream of energy from all directions fluxed into her body.</p><p>Quickly, her wings were repaired, while her aura was getting stronger and stronger.</p><p>Flop…</p><p>A sound like a cork being unplugged was faintly heard from Shanjenna’s body. Her body bloated up and turned bigger in an instant and her wings were enlarged, while the lines on them looked even more complicated than before.</p><p>At this moment, her previously shut eyes instantly opened, and a scarlet blood light flashed on them. A look of ecstasy was shown on her face as she forcefully clenched her fist and swayed her hands, creating a whooshing sound. Her figure flashed in an instant to the front of Tang Xiu, as she knelt on the floor and gratefully said, “Thank you so much, Mr. Tang.”</p><p>Tang Xiu, who had been observing Shanjenna, found that her aura was several times stronger than before. At this time, he looked at her grateful face and curiously asked, “What exactly happened to your body? Have your injuries been healed already?”</p><p>Shanjenna, who was kneeling and lowering her head toward the floor, raised her head and excitedly said, “My Bloodkin has a strict Bloodline Rank. I was only a small Baron Rank Bloodline, but after taking the pill you gave me, not only has it healed my injuries, but the most important thing is that it has qualitatively changed my Bloodline Rank and now has broken through to the Viscount Rank. Even if I were to meet that Wolfkin Beastman again, I’m confident I can blow his head off.”</p><p>Tang Xiu looked at her with a strange expression and said, “So to say, the medicinal pill I gave you that was supposed to heal your injuries seems to have an effect like a medicinal pill to increase cultivation strength, increasing your strength and upgrading your Bloodline Rank. Is that right?”</p><p>“Yes. It’s exactly what happened.” Shanjenna nodded.</p><p>“Is there any adverse effect?” Asked Tang Xiu.</p><p>“How could there be any adverse effect?” Shanjenna shook her head. “My body is presently very great, and I won’t feel weak even if I don’t drink blood in the next three days.”</p><p>Tang Xiu suddenly remembered something and asked, “Does the survival of your Bloodkin depends on drinking blood?”</p><p>“That’s right. We feed on blood since it supplies us with energy,” said Shanjenna. “We must take blood to survive and stay alive for a long time. And we can also have our Bloodline Rank undergo a qualitative change and even be promoted if we intake high-quality blood.”</p><p>Even when Tang Xiu was in the Immortal World, never did he encounter a situation like the Bloodkin’s. It piqued his curiosity, and he suddenly asked, “What kind of blood can be considered as high-quality?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
