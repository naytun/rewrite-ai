She could finally relax after having finished an unprecedented large project. Despite being young and energetic, she still rested in her place for two plus days before she recovered.</p><p>She only had a few friends in Shanghai, while the colleagues she had something in common with were even rarer. She still had three or four days left on holiday after recovering, and while today was Sunday, she eagerly rushed to Bluestar Villa to look for Tang Xiu to stroll around.</p><p>“Do you have free time today, Sis?” Tang Xiu asked as he walked down the stairs to the living room.</p><p>Chen Xiaowan got up and smilingly said, “Got nothing to do today, so I came here to find you. Anyways, are you free today? Care to accompany me shopping?”</p><p>Tang Xiu recalled his activities and found that he had nothing to do today, so he readily agreed. He had a special affection for Chen Xiaowan as a younger brother—a feeling he cherished very much.</p><p>After having breakfast, the two of them then headed to the garage, picked up the cheapest car inside, and then drove to the bustling block of Shanghai. Strolling down the streets, shopping, tasting foods, and even visiting the cinema in the afternoon until the evening, the duo then casually looked for a restaurant.”</p><p>“You have a problem with your legs, Sis?”</p><p>After ordering the dishes and handing the menu back to the waiter, Tang Xiu looked at Chen Xiaowan, who looked a bit weary.</p><p>Chen Xiayu blanked for a moment, and a bit dispirited look flashed on her face before she let out a thick smile and said, “It’s nothing. Maybe I’m just a bit tired after strolling all day long.”</p><p>“That is not a state caused by tiredness, Sis.” Tang Xiu shook his head. “There’s no need to hide anything between us, Sis. Tell me, what exactly happened?”</p><p>Hesitating, Chen Xiaowan force a smile and said, “Did you mean my left leg? Actually, I was seeing a client last week, but then it turned out that the man was a pervert and wanted to molest me, and then threw an ashtray at me. It hurt just a bit at the beginning, but it lasted for a week and doesn’t hurt too much if I don’t walk around for long.”</p><p>A client?</p><p>Tang Xiu frowned and asked, “Who is this client?”</p><p>“He’s just an ordinary client whose business was already in the yellow.” Chen Xiaowan waved her hand. “Anyways, I don’t want to talk about that man again. Anyways, Brother, there’s something bugging me, can I ask you something?</p><p>Tang Xiu observed her, and seeing that she did not want to talk about it, he did not have a choice but to suppress his doubt and say, “Alright, I’ll answer you frankly. Ask anything you want.”</p><p>“I really can’t figure out how my company’s Big Boss turned out to be your subordinate, brother?” Asked Chen Xiaowan. “Moreover, the respect she shows you is beyond that of the respect of a subordinate to her superior. Did you feed her some kind of bewitching potion? How come she is like someone whose secret is grasped by you?”</p><p>Hahaha. Tang Xiu could not help laughing and said, “Your younger brother has a charming personality, so of course my subordinate will naturally obey me. Besides, Kuwako is benefitting from me, so of course she will value my words very much. Umm, how should I say it? Ah, your younger brother is kind of a nouveau riche billionaire now.”</p><p>Pffft… Hahaha.</p><p>Chen Xiaowan could not help laughing. She charmingly rolled her eyes at Tang Xiu. Suddenly, a light flashed in her eyes as she asked with a bit of expectation, “How about you accompany me to a certain place tonight?”</p><p>“Where?” Tang Xiu immediately asked. He did not expect her to suddenly ask him on a whim, and even seemed to look forward to it.</p><p>“Well, there’s a gathering for my university graduates, my fellow students. I originally did not intend to attend it, but with you to accompany me I suddenly want to go.”</p><p>“How can I go? It’s the gathering of your university’s graduates.” Tang Xiu was at a loss whether he had to cry or laugh, and then continued, “I don’t even know anyone among them.”</p><p>Chen Xiaowan thought that Tang Xiu was correct. Her expression turned dark and said helplessly, “Then I won’t go since you don’t want to. Anyways, what are we gonna do after dinner?”</p><p>“I’ll take you to a good place!” Said Tang Xiu with a smile. “You can enjoy the leisure and entertainment there by yourself if you have some free time later.”</p><p>“What is the place?”</p><p>“The Paradise Manor.”</p><p>Two hours later, Tang Xiu arrived at the Paradise Manor with Chen Xiaowan. After passing through the entrance, however, Chen Xiaowan’s face turned strange. And after they came to the parking lot inside, she could not bear to pull Tang Xiu’s sleeve and say in a toned down voice, “Brother, we already came to this place, are you going to gather with that group of my fellow students over there?”</p><p>Fellow students?</p><p>Tang Xiu was stunned and asked with a surprised expression, “Eh? Your fellow students’ gathering is being held here?”</p><p>“Yeah.” Chen Xiaowan nodded. “Some of my fellow students are local nouveau riches here, and mixed quite well after graduation. They are also the ones who arranged this college class reunion.”</p><p>“Alright, then! Just tell me the specific place.” Tang Xiu nodded after giving it a thought. “Wait there and I’ll see you later. I’m going to see the owner of this place to get two bottles of a good wine.”</p><p>“Do you know the owner of this place?” Chen Xiaowan was surprised.</p><p>“Yeah, we are very close.” Tang Xiu suppressed his laughter.</p><p>A few minutes later, Tang Xiu appeared in Lulu’s office but saw her unexpectedly dressed up today. It was a contrast with her past style since the dress she wore today was a whole set of professional white-collar, with eyeglasses and bleached blonde hair, as she sat on the Boss chair while reading a book.</p><p>“Looking at you in this style… is quite interesting.”</p><p>Tang Xiu faintly smiled as he came before her. As his vision casually swept over the book in her hands, his expression suddenly froze.</p><p>“Chibi… Chibi Maruko-chan manga?”</p><p>Lulu put the book down and happily walked out of her desk, cheerfully turned around in front of Tang Xiu, and then spread her hands and said with a playful smile, “So, how do I look? Good, right?”</p><p>“Not bad!” Tang Xiu forced a smile. “But what you’re reading and your attire are kinda different. Forget it, let’s not talk about this. Anyways, Sis Xiaowan is with me here, and it just so happens that her fellow students from college are having a reunion here. So, I want to take two bottles of good wine to gather with them. Do you still have some Gods Nectar here?”</p><p>When Lulu heard Tang Xiu’s question, her expression turned a bit scornful and resentfully said, “I still have some. But that surnamed Kang is too stingy, you know. I have less than 100 boxes of Gods Nectar in inventory, and my staff grumbled to me a couple days ago that the rest of the Gods Nectar will be completely sold out in a few days.”</p><p>Tang Xiu rolled his eyes at her. 100 boxes are few? He was the one who set the rule in the first place. Let alone 100 boxes, nobody was able to buy eight or ten boxes if they did not buy them via the Magnificent Tang Corporation’s exclusive stores in the major cities.</p><p>“Alright, alright. You don’t know how lucky you are. Besides, the Magnificent Tang Corporation has its own rules and regulations, they won’t open the back door for you. But for you… they have given you an exception. Kang Xia will come to Shanghai a couple days later. Just keep pestering her that you want more Gods Nectar! Whether you can get it from her, it will depend on your skills.”</p><p>“Got no problem with that!” Ouyang Lulu immediately nodded.</p><p>On the roof of the three-story foreign-style building of the Paradise Manor, Ladyboy Wutong held a binoculars and watched the situation in a distant building. He could clearly see Tang Xiu and Ouyang Lulu through the window of that building.</p><p>“Who exactly is this guy? His relationship with Ice Phoenix Han Qingwu is very close, yet his relationship with other women keeps popping up. Is he not afraid Ice Phoenix will get jealous and hack him alive?”</p><p>Wu Tong had been secretly following Han Qingwu for several days. He could tell that Han Qingwu was like a young girl in love. Through his observation, he could see that the guy Han Qingwu liked was Tang Xiu, a student of Shanghai University, a guy with quite unusual behavior.</p><p>“His luck in love is really great.”</p><p>Wu Tong let out an uncanny smirk but did not feel the slightest envy at all. He only liked men, and that was particularly so towards Tang Xiu. He even imagined whether he could have some “good and pleasant times” with Tang Xiu.</p><p>“Who is it?”</p><p>Suddenly, this shemale’s complexion drastically changed, instantly turned around and grabbed his dagger. He then saw a middle-aged man with cold eyes and folded arms staring at him about seven plus meters away.</p><p>“You should already know who I am,” said Mo Awu lightly.</p><p>Wu Tong squinted, but a tempestuous shock hit his heart. He knew his own strength perfectly, and how vigilant he always was. Yet, this man was able to approach him seven-plus meters away without him being able to sense. It only meant that this man had very terrifying abilities.</p><p>“It’s you. His bodyguard?” Wu Tong extended his hand to point to the distant windows.</p><p>“Now that you already know, you should understand that you’ve already been exposed, no?” Said Mo Awu indifferently. “Now tell me, why are you tracking my Boss?”</p><p>“Hmph.” Wu Tong snorted. “I do as I please. Do I need you to mind my business?”</p><p>With that said, he immediately turned around and instantly jumped from the roof. It was a three-story building, yet he could easily jump down. While standing there, he looked up to see Mo Awu and gave him the middle finger.</p><p>Afterward, he turned around and left.</p><p>“With us here, do you think you can come and go as you please?” A figure blocked Wu Tong’s path as the sharp dagger in his hand fluttered away like a butterfly.</p><p>Wu Tong furrowed his brows and vigilantly stared at the man in front of him. He did not want to engage in a fight, so he turned around and dashed forward, attempting to leave the place for the time being. However, just as he ran about a dozen steps, another burly figure blocked his path again.</p><p>“SHIT!”</p><p>Wu Tong angrily cursed. But he did not try to run and avoid the fight this time, and rushed straight towards the burly man, sending a barrage of punches to his chest lightning fast.</p><p>Bam…</p><p>Wu Tong only saw a shadow flash near him and felt nothing but the blooming flower in front of him. His fist did not hit the man’s chest, but it was his lower abdomen that seemed to be hit by a huge force. He felt like his intestines were tied up by the pain at this moment. The most unbelievable thing was that he saw himself flying upside down to the back as the scenery from his sides brushed forward.</p><p>Cough, cough…</p><p>After heavily slamming on the cold concrete floor seven-plus meters away, Wu Tong, who had withstood all kinds of sufferings for countless times, suppressed the pain coming from his abdomen and propped himself up with his hands on the ground and stood up again in the blink of an eye.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
