In addition to Mo Awu, who usually followed him, there were only ten other guards. Despite knowing that there were many unknown enemies there, he was confident that he could completely destroy them.</p><p>Nonetheless, he still made some phone calls on the way to the Garrison Base. Aside from the class-in-charge teacher, Han Qingwu, asking for a leave, he also spoke to Xue Yu and Li Laoshan, who had been busy recently, saying that he would find the time to drink with him later. He wanted to invite Li Laoshan for a meal, but he was in a hurry to leave Shanghai, hence called the man ahead of time.</p><p>When Tang Xiu got off the car, he saw the tall and straight posture of Hu Zhenfeng, who was donned in his military uniform, as he then headed straight toward the man. Following that, he took out the green book and directly spoke, “I’m Tang Xiu. We need to immediately rush to Mist Source Island. This is the document.”</p><p>Hu Zhenfeng took the green book and looked at it a few times, saying, “I’ve received orders from my superior to use this military helicopter to send us to Nanxia Province. We’ll then have to board a ship to Mist Source Island. We’ll be arriving there before evening if the trip goes smoothly.”</p><p>“We can’t fly straight there?” Tang Xiu frowned.</p><p>“No flights can travel to and from Mist Source Island according to the Military Aircraft Agreement,” Hu Zhenfeng shook his head. “The Air Defense Division has an intercontinental armed system in Mist Source Island. Once a plane is closing about 50 kilometers with 400 meters of altitude, it will be identified as an enemy and shot down.”</p><p>“The military helicopters are not an exception either? Isn’t there also a fighter plane there?” Asked Tang Xiu.</p><p>“No. Thing is, there’s something unsuited there,” Hu Zhenfeng shook his head.</p><p>“What is this something, exactly?” Asked Tang Xiu.</p><p>“It’s a strange magnetic field that shrouds an area of dozens of kilometers in the vicinity of Mist Source Island. Any unit with a measuring device will malfunction if it enters the area. Furthermore, there’s a thick, heavy fog around Mist Source Island. We found that the island only had its fog dissipated for two hours every day ever since we discovered the island. Hence, we can only enter and exit Mist Source Island during those two hours.”</p><p>Is it a formation array?</p><p>Tang Xiu thought for a few seconds. Then, he nodded and said, “Forget it, then. Let’s go now! Anyways, can this chopper take these many people?”</p><p>“With the two pilots in the cockpit, only ten people can board the cabin. I did not know how many men you’d be taking with you, so I only asked the Military Region to prepare this helicopter. I can apply to add one more now, though,” said Hu Zhenfeng.</p><p>“Then I’ll have to trouble you,” Tang Xiu nodded.</p><p>Two minutes later, two military SUVs roared and stopped nearby as seven soldiers clad in camo uniform jumped off the car. They put down the camo bag they brought, saluted Hu Zhenfeng and said, “Phantom Combat Squad’s Captain Yu Shuqing reporting to Senior Officer, Sir!”</p><p>After returning the ceremony, Hu Zhenfeng smiled and said, “After receiving the order from the top brasses, I knew I’d see you again, old comrades! Your Phantom Special Combat Squad has made admirable distinguished services to the country over the years, and even the Senior Officer hasn’t run out of praises for you all!”</p><p>“It’s our duty to serve for the country, Sir,” said Yu Shuqing with a smile.</p><p>Hu Zhenfeng nodded and his eyes swept the other six members of Phantom Special Combat Squad. He then nodded with satisfaction and said with a smile, “I’m completely relieved to have your special operations team come with me to Mist Source island. Shuqing, let me introduce you to Tang Xiu, who is in charge of the incidents on Mist Source Island. All members of Phantom Special Combat Squad are now to take command from him.”</p><p>Yu Shuqing frowned, but still saluted to Tang Xiu, “Phantom Special Combat Squad’s Captain Yu Shuqing reporting to the leader, Sir!”</p><p>There was a bit of angry looks in the eyes of the other six members of the special operation teams behind him. They could tell that Mo Awu and the rest were very extraordinary when they arrived. More so that they could smell a faint bloody scent from their bodies that gave off quite a sense of threat even to them. But Tang Xiu was too young. The squad had always acted alone, and now that they were suddenly assigned to be under the command of an unknown young man... this greatly dissatisfied them.</p><p>Tang Xiu indifferently nodded and said, “I don’t need any other helpers actually. But since you already accepted orders, it’d be rude if I were to decline and sent you back. When we get on Mist Source Island, I’ll talk to the Military Supervisor there to make you stay in the base.”</p><p>A cold glint suffused in Yu Shuqing’s eyes as he said coldly, “You’re crazy!”</p><p>Tang Xiu shook his head and straightly ignored him. He went toward Hu Zhenfeng and led Mo Awu, Jin Shi, and the rest to board the military helicopter, leaving only two experts of the Everlasting Feast Hall behind.</p><p>“Boss, I have once dealt with someone from this Phantom Special Combat Squad,” Xue Sha spoke to Tang Xiu in a low voice after they sat down in the cabin.</p><p>Tang Xiu’s brows were raised as he asked, “When was that?”</p><p>“When I found Mouse,” said Xue Sha. “A member of this Phantom Special Combat Squad tracked us down and was intercepted by me. He did not see my appearance, though, so they didn’t recognize me.”</p><p>Tang Xiu understood in a flash as he smiled and said, “It seems like they are the ones who fought with those people from the SOE company in Shanghai. If not for our special identity, this Phantom special force is probably regarded as very powerful to ordinary people.”</p><p>“If I were to face them I could decimate this entire squad,” Xue Sha sneered.</p><p>“Don’t give me that bullshit, will you?” Tang Xiu snappily derided him. “They are just ordinary people. What identity do you have? Do you feel great comparing yourself with them?”</p><p>Ugh… Xue Sha let out a hollow laugh and bowed his head, no longer speaking.</p><p>Under the military helicopter, Mo Xiaonan, a member of Phantom Special Combat Squad squinted at the two men, Shui Gui and Ye Shisan, and immediately asked, “Senior Officer, what exactly do they do?”</p><p>“Don’t ask what you shouldn’t ask. I myself am not clear.” Hu Zhenfeng shook his head.</p><p>“You don’t know them either?” Asked Mo Xiaonan. “Doesn’t that mean that we’ll be taking orders from that brat surnamed Tang? Is this a joke or something?”</p><p>“This is an order!” rebuked Hu Zhenfeng in a deep voice.</p><p>Ye Shisan shot a cold stare at Mo Xiaonan and chillingly spoke, “If you dare to say anything more about our Boss with that insulting face of yours, I will kill you here and now even if you’re a soldier!”</p><p>Boss?</p><p>Mo Xiaonan sneered, “I was thinking he’s some kind of some big top brass or something, it turns out that he’s just a Boss, huh? What did the heck happen to our superiors’ heads? To think that they ordered us to obey the orders of a businessman? Besides… just his braggart bodyguards are a truly damn funny comedy!”</p><p>There was also an unsightly expression on Yu Shuqing’s face. But he thought that there should be a lot more than that because he felt that it was impossible for a pure businessman to be qualified to come here and also obtain the rights command them. He glared at Mo Xiaonan and scolded him in a deep voice, “Shut up!”</p><p>Mo Xiaonan hummed coldly and glared provocatively at the Ye Shisan and Shui Guo, no longer speaking.</p><p>Twenty minutes later, another military helicopter was ready. Soon after Hu Zhenfeng and the rest boarded it, it quickly disappeared into the clouds. After more than two hours, two military helicopters had already arrived at the Nanxia Province Garrison Base, while the base itself had sent six military jeeps to send them to the military port.</p><p>“LIBERTY” passenger liner.</p><p>After boarding this medium-sized liner, Hu Zhenfeng spoke to the people on the liner and then sailed directly to Mist Source Island. They must bypass Taiwan in order to go to Mist Source Island from Nanxia Province, so the voyage took a lot of time. Only after it was dusk did the liner finally enter a misty sea zone.</p><p>“Interesting.”</p><p>While standing on the bow deck, Tang Xiu folded his arms and looked around. He could clearly sense that there was a special energy drifting from the side, and it should the energy contained inside the fog. The volatility of this energy, however, had an active and stable regular pattern which was not formed by a natural formation but artificially created by an array technique.</p><p>“Tang Xiu, pay attention to your safety later. This sea area is not peaceful.” Hu Zhenfeng walked out of the cabin with a faint smile on his face, as he spoke to Tang Xiu after standing side by side.</p><p>Tang Xiu turned his head and asked, “Care to elaborate?”</p><p>“There are savage beasts in this sea area. Do you know what a savage beast is? It’s the kind of wild beast that possess a simple, intelligent mind, but its attack power is many times stronger than wild animals, especially in this foggy area which has black sharks living in. Fortunately, our ship is made of steel. If a wooden boat were to pass through this area, those black sharks would definitely be able to break the boat’s deck in one bite.”</p><p>“Why has no one ever tried to hunt these black sharks?”</p><p>“It’s not like we have never hunted them. These black sharks are huge in numbers and they also belong to social groups. Every time they appear in groups, there will be at least hundreds of them. The army garrisoned here has been dispatching soldiers to clean them up many times already, but they always feel that they cannot kill nor destroy them whatsoever.”</p><p>Tang Xiu nodded and said lightly, “I’ll send some people to help clean them up when the crisis on Mist Source Island is solved. I’m afraid we will no longer able to block the news about this island again after this incident, nonetheless. Civilians from the outside will inevitably come here, so it’s necessary to remove this crisis.”</p><p>Hu Zhenfeng’s mouth twitched, and there was contempt in his eyes when he looked at Tang Xiu. He had seen many capable people and many braggarts, but none of them was so arrogant. Even the army was unable to eradicate these black sharks, and yet, Tang Xiu, who had never seen them, actually dared to brag such a ridiculous bull here. He really couldn’t think through why the higher-ups would send such a fellow to solve the crisis on Mist Source Island.</p><p>As the liner sailed forward, it quickly passed through the foggy area and entered a clear field of vision, as a looming distant island was then seen in their range of sight. When the liner anchored on the island, Hu Zhenfeng personally took a batch of masks.</p><p>“I don’t need it,” Tang Xiu lightly shook his head.</p><p>“Don’t talk nonsense, Tang Xiu!” Hu Zhenfeng angrily said. “The virus epidemic spreading on Mist Source Island is very serious. If it wasn’t for this gas mask provided on board this ship, I would have taken them to my comrades to wear. Just hurry up and put this on. We’re going to get off the ship!”</p><p>Tang Xiu did not take it, walking to the edge of the deck before his figure then sprinted forward in an instant. After dashing for six-plus meters, he leaped over in one jump and directly landed on the shore road, while Mo Awu and the others followed suit and also jumped ashore.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
