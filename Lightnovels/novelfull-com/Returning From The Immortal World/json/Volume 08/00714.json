Ji Mu was standing in front of his family ancestral shrine, watching as his grandmother the pinched rosary beads and knocked the back of the Mokugyo. His grandmother was a devout Buddhist, and ever since his grandfather passed away more than 20 years ago, she had been living in seclusion in the ancestral shrine. She rarely walked out of the house and was ignorant of all family affairs.</p><p>Ji Mu himself was rather rebellious since childhood, though he was not a bullish character in nature. He spent his youth being wild and arrogant, but the current him was relatively mature and stable. His grandmother was his closest person since he was a child, and he subconsciously came to this place after receiving the call from Tang Xiu.</p><p>He too realized the principle of truth, that one could only seek riches and honor within risks and dangers.</p><p>The scene he saw two days ago was equal to him breaking Tang Xiu’s secret. Though he gifted many treasures and tried his best to befriend Tang Xiu in his endeavor to become an immortal who was able to mount the clouds and ride the mists, that was something that was as changeable as clouds and rains. Hence, the only way was to bet his life and fight for it.</p><p>“Grandma, I want to speak with you.”</p><p>In the past, Ji Mu would never interrupt his grandma’s meditation. But he had an appointment with Tang Xiu shortly, so this time was an exception.</p><p>Hu Shi’s closed eyes opened and, as a ray of wisdom flashed through, she stopped knocking the Mokugyo and gently got up from the cushion. She then turned to look at her grandson outside and said, “What happened?”</p><p>Ji Mu blanked out for a second, and then immediately said with a bitter expression, “Grandma, I’ve decided to go forward to do something important, so I want to have some words with you before leaving. I can only calm down if I hear your voice.”</p><p>“Is it very dangerous?” Asked Hu Shi slowly after being silent for a while.</p><p>Ji Mu nodded, but then shook his head and said, “The ancients said that one can’t catch a tiger cub if one doesn’t enter the tiger’s den, while there are honor and riches amidst dangers. Hence, I’m going to take the risk for these riches and honor.”</p><p>“The Ji Family has provided you with riches and honor, is it unable to fill your appetite?” Asked Hu Shi, frowning.</p><p>“It’s a different kind altogether, grandma.” Ji Mu shook his head. “Money can never buy the type of riches and honor I want, not even a mountain of gold and silver.”</p><p>Hu Shi shot him a deep look and said, “Since a mountain of gold and silver are unable to buy it, there’s no harm in you trying then. But think about it clearly, grandson. You’re still a young man. Very young.”</p><p>Ji Mu fell silent. He knew that he was still young, but he also thought that it was this very youth that ignited his ambition. It is said that the more we have, the more we are afraid of losing. He had yet to take over the Ji Family’s business, as his father and uncles were still in their prime. He only had a status as a member of the Ji Family as well as the wealthy life it provided.</p><p>“Have you talked to your parents or your uncles about this?” Asked Hu Shi.</p><p>“I can’t tell them about this.” Ji Mu shook his head.</p><p>“Then, what do you need from Grandma?” Hu Shi sighed.</p><p>“There’s no need, grandma,” said Ji Mu with a smile. “I already did all I could. It’s completely up to fate now. If he wishes for me to die I’m afraid no one can change my fate even if the Ji Family employs everything it has to change it. But don’t worry, though! I’ve gifted him some treasures in advance, so the chance for me to come back alive is very big.”</p><p>He? Treasures?</p><p>Hu Shi’s wrinkled face turned slightly dull as she looked at her grandson’s bright smile. She suddenly made up her mind and turned around to the desk where the ancestral memorial tablets were enshrined. From the leftmost drawer of the desk, she took out a rectangular wooden box, gently wiped the dust off it, and then returned to Ji Mu’s front, saying, “Our Ji Family were nobles and members of the Imperial Court in the eras of the Ming and Qing Dynasties. Though we have lost most of the family treasures during those difficult years, we still kept some good things until now. Take this wooden box and present it to him as a gift! If he has discerning eyes, your chance to come back alive will increase without saying anything about the thing inside this box.”</p><p>Ji Mu’s hands were a bit trembling. Though he did not know what treasure inside this wooden box was, for it to be placed in the ancestral hall explained that it was definitely something great. Yet, looking at his grandmother who was willing to give it away for his sake and the love she showed him, he was so moved that he wanted to cry.</p><p>“Off you go, grandson!” Hu Shi gently waved and sat back on the cushion.</p><p>****</p><p>Shanghai, Century Square.</p><p>Yu Shuqing sat with tilted legs on a bench at the northern end of the square while holding a hot milk tea he had just bought, chewing his last sausage. As the captain of the most mysterious Phantom Special Combat Squad in China, he had been through life and death situations for countless times. At the moment, however, he looked like a street guy who did some dirty business.</p><p>“Do you think that money loving guy will come here, Captain?”</p><p>On the flower bed next to Yu Shuqing, Mo Xiaonan was yawning and looking bored. Only the good-looking belle who occasionally passed by made him look a bit spirited.</p><p>“He will. His mind is full of greed over money, so he naturally won’t miss the opportunity to make a fortune,” said Yu Shuqing casually. “Don’t look at that guy like he is just crooked, since he does have a lot of abilities. Else, how can he get information that those fellas in the intelligence agency can’t find again and again?”</p><p>“He does have the ability, but his heart is way too black. His price got higher after last time, demanding 1 million this time. You know, I still feel pained even though the money is not mine,” groaned Mo Xiaonan.</p><p>A smile outlined in Yu Shuqing’s mouth as he sipped his milk tea and asked with a smile, “Between 1 million and lives, which one do you think is the most important?”</p><p>Ugh… Mo Xiaonan touched his nose looking embarrassed and no longer spoke.</p><p>Without much disturbance, a young man donned in a gaudy attire, a stick in this mouth, and a chin like an ape’s appeared before Yu Shuqing and Mo Xiaonan like a thief. He sat down on the bench where Yu Shiqing was sitting and then took out a pack of crumpled cigarettes. He took out one, lit it, and then took a deep puff with a happy look on his face. Then, he laughed and said, “Okay, money money money. Gimme my money fast. My time is very precious, and every second wasted is equivalent to a dime slipping from my fingers.”</p><p>“I know the rules, Mouse. A penny is equal to one item, but you should not rush to get the money without giving the goods, no?” said Yu Shuqing indifferently.</p><p>Mouse took out a dirty black book from his pocket and threw it to Yu Shuqing, saying, “I know you understand the rules, buddy. We have done business more than once or twice. You also know that this Mouse has a guaranteed credibility, so I’m not afraid that you’ll take back your words. Anyways, the information you need is in the book, along with my account number.”</p><p>Yu Shuqing nodded and gulped down the remaining milk tea. Then he got up and said, “Same old rules. 50% deposit transferred to your account within half an hour, while the remaining will be transferred after the information has been confirmed with no errors. Speaking about it, are you interested in serving the country? Like being a field personnel of the intelligence department?”</p><p>Mouse blinked and asked, “Is the pay good?”</p><p>Rolling his eyes at him, Yu Shuqing did not want to bother with this money grubber again and went straight away with Mo Xiaonan, whose expression was rather unsightly.</p><p>Mouse, however, did not rush to leave. He touched his chin while watching Yu Shuqing’s and Mo Xiaonan’s backs. A thought churned inside his mind after hearing the over-formal language used by Yu Shuqing a while ago. He could tell Yu Shuqing’s identity… someone working for the country.</p><p>He should be a soldier, and also not your ordinary serviceman. Mouse bit the cigarette and languidly leaned on the bench, taking out a mobile phone and waiting for the text notification for the transferred money.</p><p>“Are you Mouse?”</p><p>Two figures appeared in front of him. The middle-aged man on the left had a fiery gaze with a chilling expression and talked with an imposing manner.</p><p>Mouse frowned and his eyeballs rotated fast. One of his hands was already stuffed in his pocket and gripped a knife. He slowly raised his head, looked at the two middle-aged men and asked, “May I know who you are, two amigos? Can I ask what you need from his Big Brother, eh?”</p><p>“Not bad. You are called Mouse, but you’re as sly as a fox, eh? Like a top dog information broker should be, you’re really an intelligence player in nature. Anyways, let me introduce myself. My name is Jin Shi, and I want to make a deal with you.”</p><p>“Jin Shi?” Mouse squinted his eyes yet maintained extreme vigilance inside. He knew that the other party had already investigated him, so the disguise in his words was useless. He had interacted and had done deals with countless of people from all walks of life, but only some people that could make him dread, just like those two servicemen who left just a while ago.</p><p>However, this Jin Shi and his companion gave him a huge sense of threat. Nobody knew that all the fine hairs in the pores all over his body had turned erect, and he felt a chill on his neck.</p><p>“What deal?” Asked Mouse calmly.</p><p>“I need specific information about the many murders in Shanghai recently, and we also give you a chance to be incorporated in our ranks. Also, you only have two chances to refuse.”</p><p>There was a strange expression on Mouse’s face. Never did he think that the other party would offer him such a ridiculous transaction.</p><p>They want me to be incorporated into their ranks? I’m a powerful character who is famous as the Eyes of the Underground in Shanghai, a top dog who has ventured to every sewer beneath Shanghai, and yet, to my surprise, they treat just like they’re gaining something on my loss?</p><p>After clearing his throat, Mouse let out a dry smile and said, “I still need to know who you are before refusing.”</p><p>“You will need to use up your two chances, that I know,” said Jin Shi. “We are from the Everlasting Feast Hall. Maybe you don’t know much about us, but we are more powerful than you think.”</p><p>The Everlasting Feast Hall? The topmost high-end restaurant in Shanghai?</p><p>Mouse let out a curse of contempt inwardly. Even if there is a very strong force behind the Everlasting Feast Hall, can it be compared with the entire country? Just now, I even refused the invitation from the country.</p><p>“I refuse,” said Mouse with a clear and firm tone.</p><p>“Alright. You just wasted your first chance,” said Jin Shi with a grin. “Now I will give you another chance. Choose between your life and death. Join us and live; refuse and die.”</p><p>“You’re just using coercion!” Mouse raised his voice. “What you are doing will only receive contempt from others. Also, this is just the same as forcing a donkey to dance, for there is no way in hell it will happen. Chances are you will get an unsatisfactory result yet feel good about it.”</p><p>“Well, I heard you like money?” Said Jin Shi with a smile.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
