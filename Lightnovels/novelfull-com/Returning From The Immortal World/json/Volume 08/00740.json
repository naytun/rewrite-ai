That is, as long as your work hard!”</p><p>“Thanks a lot, Boss!”</p><p>Jin Shi’s group of ten looked pleasantly surprised as they cupped their fists and thanked him at the same time.</p><p>The smile on Tang Xiu’s face turned a bit thicker. Manufacturing interspatial rings would need several precious materials, such as the rare and difficult to find Void Crack Stone. But the Everlasting Feast Hall recently purchased precious ores in large numbers, and from the list Gu Xiaoxue sent him he learned that there were a dozen fist-sized Void Crack Stones among them.</p><p>At present, it was a good time and opportunity to buy his men’s hearts, something he did not want to waste.</p><p>Tang Xiu then stored all the suitcases Xie Zhiqiang was going to take away into his interspatial ring. And when Mo Awu had stuffed all the contrabands and prohibited stuff in the underground base along with all the explosives in his interspatial ring, the company put on Invisible Talismans and then departed silently.</p><p>Although the previous gunfire occurred inside, the scene was dozens of meters deep in the underground and no noise could be heard at the outside. Hence, no outsiders knew that a brutal massacre had just happened. However, the explosion of the six SUVs had aroused the attention of some people nearby, such as someone from the State Intelligence Agency.</p><p>Chen Bing.</p><p>He was a top soldier, the first line of the intelligence network who had repeatedly accomplished his missions overseas and achieved relatively good results. He was transferred back to the mainland not long ago after the killings in Shanghai. After his investigation, he had determined that the Kangsha Pharmaceuticals, a subsidiary company of the Brain Assembly Biotech, was very suspicious and highly likely to be the hiding place of the third man in charge of the overseas SOE company.</p><p>“Have you had any contact with the guy called Mouse?” Asked Chen Bing, who stood at the gate of Kangsha Pharmaceuticals looking at the eyes of four ordinary security guards.</p><p>“No, we did not see him. It’s like he was just evaporated from the world. We can’t find him at all.”</p><p>“Keep looking for him. Make sure you get in touch with him.”</p><p>With that order, Chen Bing turned to the car parked on the roadside. Although he did not know what happened inside Kangsha Pharmaceuticals’ complex and why the fire broke out in a short time, he did not intend to give up the investigation. However, it was four in the morning, the time when the security guards inside the company were the most vigilant.</p><p>He could only wait after dawn to let the security guards inside think that nobody would sneak into the venue. Only then would it be the best time to sneak inside and do the investigation.</p><p>****</p><p>Bluestar Villa District.</p><p>Just as Tang Xiu returned home, he received a call from Mouse. After listening to his report, Tang Xiu fell silent for a while and slowly said, “Can you confirm the identity of the other party?”</p><p>“I have no way to figure it out for the time being,” said Mouse. “But I suspect that he’s a member of the State Intelligence Agency. There was a fierce combat in the vicinity of Kangsha Pharmaceuticals last night, so the party who is most anxious about it should be them. Also, those two men in full body armor involved in the combat severely injured a few special soldiers from the army, the very reason they ought to be anxious.”</p><p>“Drag the time until dawn before you contact them,” said Tang Xiu slowly. “If they want to buy information from you, just tell them directly that Xie Zhiqiang has fled abroad and escaped through some special channels. Tell them that you don’t know anything clearly. Furthermore, you will inform them that those SOE company’s people have also left and some people burned the dead bodies inside Kangsha Pharmaceuticals last night. You don’t have to tell them the identity of those bodies. Just tell them that all of them were foreigners.”</p><p>“I understand. But…” Mouse replied and there was a hesitant tone in his voice.</p><p>“Just speak it out directly. I don’t like mutters and mumbles,” said Tang Xiu.</p><p>Mouse quickly said, “I already sold the information to the military before, Boss. If I were to sell the information to them according to what you told me, I’m afraid… it will cause them to be vigilant. I fear they will put me on the watch list once this matter is over.”</p><p>“I’ll dispatch some men to escort you out of Shanghai tonight,” said Tang Xiu. “We still need to set up the intelligence network of the surrounding cities. You will go and stay in Changxi for two days before moving to another city. In addition, I’ll assign two experts to protect you and also to teach you some disguise techniques.”</p><p>“Thanks a lot, Boss,” said Mouse rapidly.</p><p>Tang Xiu hung up and then took Mo Awu to the study room. After taking out six large and on small suitcases from his interspatial ring, he opened the small one first. It was covered with foam inside with quite a deep block that held six bottles of green granules.</p><p>“Is this the gene particle, Boss?” Mo Awu picked up a bottle and curiously asked after observing it repeatedly.</p><p>“It should be, else Xie Zhiqiang would not be so cautious and discrete,” confirmed Tang Xiu. “If anything, we have yet to know whether there are any side effects of using this gene particle. Therefore, I must conduct an experiment. I’ve been thinking about some candidates to experiment on on the way back here.”</p><p>“Who are you going to experiment it on, Boss?” Asked Mo Awu, baffled.</p><p>“I’m going to find a way to get a batch of death row inmates who are about to be executed from some state prisons,” said Tang Xiu. “They’re going to die anyway, so it’s rather suitable to experiment it on them.”</p><p>Mo Awu’s expression seemed suddenly enlightened with an idea and argued with a serious expression, “The prisons in our country are somewhat different from those in foreign countries. Whether it’s the management system or the attitude of its internal staff, it will be very difficult to get the death row inmates outside. How about I take a trip to a certain country, Boss? As long as we have enough money to offer, we can buy quite a lot of prisoners.”</p><p>Tang Xiu pondered about Mo Awu’s idea and felt that it made sense. He did not want to get into troublesome matters in China, especially with the government involved It would be much better and feasible if he could spend money to get some death row inmates from some prisons abroad.</p><p>“From which country’s prisons do you think more are suitable for the plan, Awu?”</p><p>“What is the true purpose of your experiment, Boss?” Asked Mo Awu. “I mean, once you have tested the gene particle and found that it has no side effects, those people you have experimented it on will definitely have their strength greatly promoted. How are you going to handle them then? If you plan to directly kill them, there are many choices you can pick such as the ten most inhumane prisons in the world which have a large number of inmates dying every year. But if you don’t want to avoid killing and even want to put them to use, we need to screen them out well.”</p><p>Tang Xiu forced a smile and said, “I can be ruthless and merciless toward my enemies, I admit that. But for those who have not offended me, it would be difficult for me to do the same. In the case… that if the gene particle does not have side effects, I do have a plan to receive these people to work for me.”</p><p>Mo Awu thought it through carefully and finally said, “If that is the case, there’s a suitable prison for that: Israel, Concentration Camp No. 1319. It’s a concentration camp where lethally dangerous prisoners are being detained, and the information regarding this entire place is highly confidential. Awen had been there before to assassinate a notorious arms dealer. According to the intel we acquired before, Concentration Camp No. 1319 is only a large prison in Israel, but few know that 16 countries in the United Nations have signed a top-secret agreement to send the cruelest and lethally dangerous individuals in the world, over 60% of them had been secretly sent to be detained there.”</p><p>“You mean, the prisoners being detained there are all terrifying and horrible individuals?” Asked Tang Xiu in surprise.</p><p>“Yeah. Nearly all of them have hands stained with blood.” Mo Awu nodded. “About 80% of the prisoners detained there will die inside. The number of prisoners being held in this prison is not many, about more than 1200 people five years ago. But if all those 1200 people were to be let loose together in any country, I’m very sure that country would fall into turmoil in no time.</p><p>“The world’s top hitman organization, Dark Spirit of the Night, that was destroyed 11 years ago, had its most horrifying number one hitman, Spectre, detained there. He was a terrifying character who was the subject of horror talk of the world’s leaders and with hands that had claimed thousands of people’s souls.”</p><p>Tang Xiu furrowed his brows and asked, “Why didn’t he escape if he’s so powerful?”</p><p>“Concentration Camp No. 1319 is not an easy place to enter and is even more difficult to come out,” explained Mo Awu with a forced smile. “Back when I, Awen, and the other six experts of our Everlasting Feast Hall went there, it could be said that we exhausted every trick we had up our sleeves before we were finally able to sneak Awen inside. To get him out, we collaborated with some people in the inside, and yet, we barely came out alive after paying the price with the death of one of us and at the cost of the severe injuries of the other five.”</p><p>Hiss… Tang Xiu could not help but gasp. He knew perfectly well about Mo Awu and Mo Awen’s strength. They were already very formidable before they became cultivators. And yet, he never thought that they had to pay such a big price to assassinate their target there.</p><p>Tang Xiu lit up a cigarette. After it was halfway burned, he then asked the issue he was most concerned about, “This prison is horrifyingly terrible, is it really not easy to get him out of this prison?”</p><p>“One can make the devils push the millstone as long as he has money,” said Mo Awu. “If you can afford the price, it won’t be an issue.”</p><p>“How much do you think it will be to get Spectre out of this prison?” Asked Tang Xiu.</p><p>“It would be extremely difficult without preparing nine digits,” said Mo Awu with a forced smile. “And I’m talking about US dollars.”</p><p>Tang Xiu’s pupils contracted and commented with an astounded expression, “At least 100 million US dollars?”</p><p>“Yeah.” Mo Awu nodded. “I once heard a news that Spectre had a personal enemy who was willing to pay 100 million USD to enter that prison to exact his revenge and kill him. In the end, that man not only failed to get his revenge but also buried himself inside.”</p><p>“Eh? You mean, Spectre killed the guy inside the prison?” Asked Tang Xiu.</p><p>“Yeah.” Mo Awu nodded.</p><p>“That’s interesting.” Tang Xiu smiled. “This Spectre piqued my interest. Anyways, let’s wait first! I’m kind of broke as of now, and it will be a fool’s dream to get him out of prison right now. The most important thing for me now is to make more money.”</p><p>Following that, Tang Xiu opened the other six suitcases, two of which contained a variety of exquisite and sophisticated instruments, dozens of types of them, while the other four large suitcases were stuffed with various documents.</p><p>“Interesting. Other than the data of this gene particle, there is still the data on the development of that full body armor. It seems that the harvest this time is not just the gene particle!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
