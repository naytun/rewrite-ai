He could feel her fluctuating emotions and how she really missed Gu Yan’er. Putting her story bluntly, it could be said that the core experts of the Everlasting Feast were very fortunate, or at least much luckier than her, for they still had the Everlasting Feast Hall as their home… and family, whereas she was like a lonely soul, a ghost, who had been wandering alone outside for many years.</p><p>As his eyes fell on Zidan and Ye Shisan’s faces, he found that their expression when they looked at her was much gentler than before.</p><p>“Zhenlei, do you want to see Yan’er?”</p><p>Zhenlei Duomo’s body shook, and then she hastily asked, “Can I see her? Do you know her whereabouts?”</p><p>“Of course I know her whereabouts,” Tang Xiu nodded. “As for whether you can see her, that will depend on your performance.”</p><p>“What do you want me to do?” She asked quickly.</p><p>“I may allow your Reston gang to temporarily stay in Mist Source Island under one condition: obey my orders while you stay here. Of course, I can also guarantee your safety in Mist Source Island. I can make sure of your safety even from those two elephant organizations, the Pyramid and the Stygian Club.”</p><p>Zhenlei Duomo shot Tang Xiu a deep look. A contemptuous look gradually emerged in her eyes as she shook her head and said, “You don’t know how horrifying these two huge organizations are. If I were you, there is no way I would dare to brag.”</p><p>Tang Xiu just grinned in response before he smilingly said, “There is a Chinese saying that one can be a frog sitting in the bottom of a well. You may know some secrets in this world, but what you know is nothing but superficial. I never liked to boast, and you can see for yourself whether I can thoroughly protect you as long as you agree.”</p><p>“Tell me, why should I trust you?” after a long time in hesitation, Zhenlei Duomo cautiously asked.</p><p>“I don’t think you have any other choices, regardless. You can only choose to trust me if you want to keep staying in Mist Source Island and see Yan’er. Besides, you can throw away your worry that I’ll push you into my machinations because you would be nothing but a corpse now if I really wanted to kill you.”</p><p>As an intelligent individual, Zhenlei Duomo could see Tang Xiu’s confident expression and fell silent. Then, she asked, “What exactly do you want me to do?”</p><p>“I need your help. To completely eradicate the Stygian Club, the Pyramid, and the other forces, or drive them away from Mist Source Island,” said Tang Xiu categorically. “When we’re done solving the problem on this island, I’ll take you to see Yan’er.”</p><p>Zhenlei Duomo’s pupils shrunk. She suddenly realized that the young man named Tang Xiu before her was not as simple as she thought him to be. At the very least, there was not only him and his two men at present. After taking a deep breath, she asked, “One last question. It’s about you and her… what is your relationship with her?”</p><p>Ye Shisan, who was standing at the side, was angered upon seeing her still not agreeing with Tang Xiu. He was finally unable to hold it after hearing her question and shouted in a heavy tone, “You ask too much, Zhenlei! Boss has already valued you highly by answering your previous questions. Give your answer to the Boss, now! Are you willing to work for him while in Mist Source Island or not?”</p><p>“You…” Zhenlei Duomo’s brows wrinkled.</p><p>“I’m warning you! This is your only chance to go home,” Ye Shisan waved his hand to interrupt her and shouted. “If you don’t cherish it you can continue living a lonely life wandering abroad. To live and die in loneliness.”</p><p><em>A chance… to return… of going back… home?</em></p><p>Zhenlei Duomo shivered inside, as though she suddenly realized something. With a bit of inconceivable expression, she looked at Tang Xiu, then to Ye Shisan and Zidan. Countless thoughts swirled inside her head before she finally steeled her heart, clenched her teeth and said, “I promise! But I’ll back out and refuse if your request is too much.”</p><p>“First thing you gotta do is to scatter your Reston members. I don’t want them to be killed amidst the slaughter between the other armed forces. I want them to act as intelligence personnel to find out the movements of other forces on the island and to give me feedback in time. You have formidable strength, so you are to stay with me!”</p><p>Zhenlei Duomo thought about it for a moment before she slowly nodded and said, “Alright. I’ll convey the instructions immediately.”</p><p>Tang Xiu stopped her and said, “Tell your men to behave and act dutifully. Don’t do any evil things in Mist Source Island. This place is under Chinese authority and I’m responsible for solving the crisis here, so I don’t want your men looking for trouble that will affect me.”</p><p>“Understood.” Zhenlei Duomo replied and flashed toward her subordinates in the distance.</p><p>Zidan, who stood beside Tang Xiu, looked at him and spoke in a low voice, “Do you really want to take her into our Everlasting Feast Hall?”</p><p>“She has some history with Yan’er, after all,” Tang Xiu sighed. “I’ll consider it if her inner making is not bad. Let’s just observe her first. Besides, we still have grave problems to deal with here on Mist Source Island. Those foreign forces are like starving jackals, fixedly setting their greedy eyes on the resources of this island in an attempt to threaten the Chinese government. We don’t have much time left since I must also participate in the research of the cure of the Darkening Virus. So we must be swift and ruthless, be it our movements or actions.”</p><p>“So, what do we do next?” Asked Zidan.</p><p>“Now that Zhenlei Duomo has killed Miao Hengfu, it can be said we have removed one of the hidden dangers already,” said Tang Xiu. “The next thing we gotta do is deal with those foreign forces. Let them cut one another’s throat till nearly dying. Only then will we move to clean up the mess left behind.”</p><p>Mixed Summit City, the northern suburbs.</p><p>The Stygian Club had moved their camp here because the place was surrounded by mountains on three sides, and Keith Moor also thought that the place was quite concealed. Those Elementalists from the Pyramid were as though having gone insane as they launched several strikes in succession, causing two members of the Darksoul squad he personally recruited to suffer heavy losses. Even Basil and Alody were both subjected to severe injuries.</p><p>Keith Moore’s eyes were chilling as his stare was fixated on the young man in front of him.</p><p>“Yes, we’ve thoroughly investigated it. It was the Pyramid’s people who attacked all the other forces last night. They used the dead bodies of our men to frame and make us the scapegoat. And now those forces are joining hands. On the one hand is to keep a distance from the Pyramid, and are also preparing to get rid of us, on the other hand.”</p><p>“Don’t tell me they don’t know that this is the Pyramid’s machination?” Keith Moor angrily shouted.</p><p>“Nobody among them is a fool, for they are able to grab and hold power in their hands.” The youth bitterly smiled and said, “And yet, they are still preparing to get rid of us, which means that they have always seen our presence here as a threat to them. And thus, despite knowing that this is a machination run by the Pyramid, this incident actually gives them an opportunity to join forces in order to have a chance to contend with us. People with power are ambitious, to begin with, and what they always want is to obtain more resources and profits!”</p><p>Keith Moore scowled and asked, “Then what about the Pyramid’s people?”</p><p>The young man replied, “They are now only 30 kilometers away from us, stationed in the mountain to the east. We’ve already investigated them, they far outnumber us. Also, we found another thing during the investigation, that is, one of the Pyramid’s War Elders, Bodart, is also here.”</p><p>“That Ghoul Demon War Elder, Bodart?”</p><p>Keith Moore’s eyes turned icy cold as intense killing intent burst out from his eyes. He had some friction with most of the Pyramid’s War Elders, and this Ghoul Demon War Elder Bodart was one he had a particular grudge with!</p><p>“Arrange the Blood Formation with Blood Poison.” Keith Moore issued an order from the slit of his teeth.</p><p>The youth’s complexion changed and hastily said, “But Sir, we will end up perishing together with them if we set up the Blood Formation!”</p><p><em>Pa…</em></p><p>Keith Moor slapped the youth and bellowed, “You damn idiot. We won’t die with them! Go tell the others to get ready! Since they want to exterminate us, then we’ll kill them first!”</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>The youth looked frightened and quickly got up from the ground and run out of the tent.</p><p>Dust came.</p><p>Tang Xiu led Zidan, Ye Shisan, and Zhenlei Duomo as they quietly appeared in the eastern side of Mixed Summit City. After scouting, they found that the forces of all involved parties were already stationed in this place.</p><p><em>Whoosh…</em></p><p>A ghostly figure silently appeared nearby.</p><p>Zhenlei Duomo pulled her long saber out instantly as a thick killing intent locked on the man in a flash.</p><p>“DON’T!”</p><p>Tang Xiu immediately stopped her and looked at Jin Shi who appeared lighting fast, and then asked, “How is the situation?”</p><p>Jin Shi shot Zhenlei Duomo a cold glance before he replied to Tang Xiu respectfully, “Boss, the Pyramid is now stationed in the northwest direction of Mixed Summit City. They number up to 62 people from our investigation. Also, we’ve determined that the leader is called Wu Ji, the organization’s Intelligence War Elder.”</p><p>“The Pyramid’s War Elder, eh?” Tang Xiu nodded and sneered. “Hehehe… They really value Mist Source Island highly for such a bigwig to have appeared here.”</p><p>Jin Shi then said with solemnity, “It appears that not only the Intelligence War Elder is here, but also the Ghoul Demon War Elder, Bodart. The attack launched at the Stygian Club was the work of Bodart and his men.”</p><p>“Got it.” Tang Xiu replied, and then turned to look at Zhenlei Duomo and plainly said, “It’s just some people. Not worth for us to fuss over. Anyways, Jin Shi is my man, and the rest will come here later as well.”</p><p>Zhenlei Duomo was somewhat taken aback inside. She did not expect Tang Xiu to have so many cultivators under him. More so that the guy who just arrived also had the strength that could not be underestimated.</p><p>At this moment, the was becoming more curious about the number of Tang Xiu’s men. Inferring from what he said, it was apparent that he should have more of them, no?</p><p>Two hours later, Zhenlei Duomo looked at the nine men in front of Tang Xiu and was greatly shocked. Nine experts! And all of them were cultivators!! Being able to control such a formidable force was already dreadful. They could freely roam anywhere. A terrifying force that could occupy a very large territory with might!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
