One reason why she came here (Mist Source Island) was that she wanted to explore the situation of the mysterious Orient. And it couldn’t be better to get wind of the woman who had reared and cultivated her.</p><p>“Your Excellency, do you know who I am?” asked  Zhenlei Duomu, looking at Tang Xiu with vigilance.</p><p>Tang Xiu said with a smile, “You are the famed second in command of the Mexican Reston Mafia syndicate, and the legendary she-devil unites wisdom and power, nobody doesn’t know. But I never thought that I would encounter you here, it appears that quite a few people are casting their greedy eyes on the property of China!”</p><p>Zhenlei Duomu said indifferently, “Since you know who I am, then please tell me who you are?”</p><p>“I’m Tang Xiu.” Tang Xiu replied distantly.</p><p>Zhenlei Duomu was not too pleased with the answer, a mere name didn’t make sense to her. What she wanted to know was that who the hell was Tang Xiu and what the origin of him. Besides, she now had realized that it definitely wasn’t a simple coincidence to encounter the guy named Tang Xiu.</p><p>“Are you scheming against me now?”</p><p>Tang Xiu gave an uneasy little titter, he had indeed schemed against Zhenlei Duomu. But Miao Wenlei had already been killed, as well as Miao Hengfu. Under the condition that ‘dead men tell no tales’, he was certainly unwilling to eat crow. In addition, some regrets still lingered in his feeling, that was, no martial arts super grandmaster had been hired by the forcible-feeble Miao Hengfu, so Reston Mafia syndicate suffered little from Miao, otherwise, he could have killed two birds with one stone.</p><p>“Zhenlei Duomu, I don’t know what you mean. We just happened to pass by here, no one has been going to see the fun. But say, how dare you to kill my countrymen in my territory?”</p><p>Being outraged by Tang Xiu’s words, Zhenlei Duomu said, “How could those good-for-nothings kill many of my subordinates near my encampment? Are Chinese people enjoy feigning madness and acting like an idiot?”</p><p>“Ring…”</p><p>Tang Xiu’s communication equipment suddenly rang. Being glared at by Zhenlei Duomu, Tang Xiu answered the phone, “What happened?”</p><p>“Original translation from Www。WangmamaRead。Com。”</p><p>Half a minute later.</p><p>Tang Xiu’s facial expression became odd. Hanging up the phone with “OK”, he looked at Zhenlei Duomu with a faint smile and said, “Well, I admit to sending someone to do it, but I have done it with the best intentions. I have done this for the benefit of you and your Reston, the Mexican Mafia syndicate.”</p><p>Zhenlei Duomu replied furiously, “Killing my subordinates will benefit me? Are you talking nonsense?”</p><p>Tang Xiu said seriously, “I suspect you are ignorant of what happened to the village, in which you stationed. Similarly, you may not know what has happened to more than a dozen foreign forces last night. However, you should be grateful to me, who has saved the Reston from a disaster by killing some of your subordinates. Let’s put it in a different way, I am the one who has saved your lives.”</p><p>“What happened?”</p><p>Zhenlei Duomu was stunned. Being bewildered by what Tang Xiu had said, she stared at him who was serious. Now that Tang Xiu admitted to scheming against her, how could he save her life? Six of her subordinates were killed!</p><p>“Are you talking nonsense or kidding me?”</p><p>Tang Xiu sneered, saying, “It seems that your intelligence agency works badly. Last night, the Stygian Club, the third largest dangerous group in the world, raided more than a dozen foreign forces. Several weak forces were almost eradicated. While the world’s largest organization, Pyramids, launched a fierce counterattack against the Stygian Club. The other two forces that were stationed in the village at the same time as you were also suffered a lot of losses. I picked you and let you leave there temporarily, isn’t it to prevent you from being attacked? ”</p><p>“What? The Stygian Club?”</p><p>Zhenlei Duomu’s face changed sharply, and her eyes showed a deep fear. As a cultivator, she naturally knew some inside stories.</p><p>But.</p><p>How dare the Stygian Club?</p><p>Tang Xiu sneered, “If I don’t get it wrong, now the foreign forces of the entire Mist Source Island have begun to unite secretly. The Stygian Club has too much ambition, this time it gets into big trouble. Later there will be a life and death contest between the united forces and the Stygian Club. And I, try to pull your Reston organization out of this chaos, do I make a mistake?”</p><p>“Well…”</p><p>Although Zhenlei Duomu felt that Tang Xiu was distorting the argument, she had no words to refute. If it was as he said, it seemed that they really had big luck. After all, the horrible power of the Stygian Club was definitely much beyond that of the Reston Mafia.</p><p>No!</p><p>Precisely, even a hundred of organizations like the Reston couldn’t compete with the horrible strength of the Stygian Club.</p><p>Zhenlei Duomu took a deep breath and said slowly, “Mr. Tang, as for what you said, I haven’t received any concrete news yet. Since we are not enemies, and I have no intention of being an enemy of Chinese cultivators. So, I hope that we will not be enemies in the future either.”</p><p>Tang Xiu smiled, “One more enemy is better than one more friend. If you are willing to leave Mist Source Island with the Reston, I promise that we will not be enemies.”</p><p>Zhenlei Duomu frowned and said, “I think whether we Reston leave Mist Source Island or not is not up to Mr. Tang, what do you think? Or you can represent the official of China?”</p><p>Tang Xiu took out the green book and showed it to Zhenlei Duomo, saying, “Unfortunately, indeed I can. Only if I have this book, I can make official claims. The reason why I bring people here this time in person is to deal with problems here. I can tell you that all foreign forces that continue to stay in Mist Source Island will be enemies of my nation and mine. ”</p><p>Zhenlei Duomu was shocked, but she still restrained the chilliness of her body in a sudden. She took a serious look at Tang Xiu and finally said slowly, “If you can answer me a question and your answer satisfies me, then we can leave Mist Source Island immediately.”</p><p>“Just say it!”</p><p>Tang Xiu was aware of the recalcitration of Zhenlei Duomu, but he knew that she should dare not to make an enemy of him.</p><p>Zhenlei Duomu asked, “Although Mr. Tang represents the official of China, you are a cultivator, after all, you should know something about the Chinese cultivators. I want to ask you about a person, she is also a cultivator.”</p><p>Tang Xiu was surprised, “Who?”</p><p>Zhenlei Duomu frowned and said, “I’m not clear about her condition. I only know that her name is Yan. More than 20 years ago, she was about twenty. So now she should be forty or fifty.”</p><p>Forty or fifty?</p><p>Yan?</p><p>Tang Xiu shook his head and said, “Sorry, I have never heard of this person.”</p><p>Zhenlei Duomu’s eyes showed a disappointment, and she said bitterly, “Since Mr. Tang isn’t clear about that, I can only consult other cultivators in China. To be honest, she funded me to grow up and later taught me cultivation methods, but I lost her connection many years ago.”</p><p>Tang Xiu nodded and said, “I have never heard of the person you said. I don’t know much about the Chinese cultivation world, actually. Many cultivators are anonymous or seclude themselves in deep mountains. Unless they are willing to tell their address, otherwise it is difficult for others to know their existence.”</p><p>Zhenlei Duomu didn’t want to stay longer with Tang Xiu. Since she didn’t get the answer she wanted, she immediately said with a fist salute, “If so, we’ll be off now.”</p><p>Tang Xiu didn’t stop her, while looking at her leaving back, he was about to leave with Zidan and Ye Shisan. Suddenly Zidan leaned over to Tang Xiu and lowered his voice, “Boss, you seem to have forgotten a person.”</p><p>Tang Xiu wondered, “Who?”</p><p>Zidan said, “The founder of Everlasting Feast Hall, the last big boss.”</p><p>Gu Yan’er?</p><p>Tang Xiu stunned for a while, and suddenly his expression changed slightly. Twenty years ago, his dear apprentice should be in her twenties, and there was also a “Yan” in her name. Could there be any connection between them?</p><p>“Go to get her back.”</p><p>Tang Xiu sat down directly and took the pen and paper from the Spatial Ring to paint the portrait of Gu Yan’er. Suddenly he remembered something, he took the phone out, opened the album, and picked Gu Yan’er Photo. A minute later, the vigilant Zhenlei Duomu stood in front of Tang Xiu again.</p><p>“What else?” She asked.</p><p>Zhenlei Duomu was on guard against Tang Xiu, but she did not fear him. She knew clearly that she was no match for Tang Xiu, but he couldn’t stop her if she wanted to escape.</p><p>Tang Xiu handed the phone to Zhenlei Duomu, saying indifferently, “Look at the picture. Is she the woman you are looking for?”</p><p>Being confused, Zhenlei Duomu took the phone. When she saw the picture on the phone, her eyes shone brightly and her body shivered violently.</p><p>“That’s right, it’s her.”</p><p>Zhenlei Duomu said in a wobbly voice. She remembered the face clearly as it was deeply engraved in her heart. That woman was exceptionally beautiful and elegant in those days. Zhenlei Duomu had no idea what a holy and pure person would be like in the past, however, she found the answer at the first sight since she saw the woman.</p><p>Tang Xiu touched his nose with his hand, deep down, he smiled wryly. He knew Gu Yan’er had travelled around the world, but he had never expected that she should have such a disciple in Mexico.</p><p>“Why do you want to find her?”</p><p>After being silent for a while, Tang Xiu asked slowly.</p><p>Zhenlei Duomu was reluctant to look away from the picture, saying with an irrepressible excitement, “She is my benefactor, teacher, and mother, who supported me a lot in my life like my mother. I made mistakes of killing an evildoer in front of her at that time, so she left and told me I was not allowed to step into China. However… I miss her.”</p><p>Hearing that, Tang Xiu was stunned. He understood Gu Yan’er‘s thought at that time immediately. She would never abandon Zhenlei Duomu even if Zhenlei Duomu killed someone. Hadn’t people who returned from the immortal world killed many people?</p><p>Perhaps!</p><p>It was because of her body condition.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
