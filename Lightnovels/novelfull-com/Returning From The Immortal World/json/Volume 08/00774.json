Does the Public Security Bureau or the traffic police force butt in?”</p><p>Ye Shisan nodded and said, “Through the network intrusion, Zidan has confirmed that the traffic police force has poked their nose into the case. The Public Security Bureau of Wolfpack City should have already gathered now, but for no reason, they suddenly dissolved.”</p><p>Tang Xiu nodded and sneered, “Miao Hengfu can become the richest local tyrant of Mist Source Island, his network must be very solid. So it’s natural for him to maneuver the Public Security Bureau. Just wait and see!”</p><p>“Original translation from Www。WangmamaRead。Com。”</p><p>After some hesitation, Ye Shisan asked, “Boss, although we have set the trap for both the Stygian Club and those Talented Adepts, we are not able to spy on them. If there are any anomalies on either party of the two, we can’t adjust the plan in time!”</p><p>Tang Xiu smiled and said, “Awu has found that those Talented Adepts was from the world’s largest organization: Pyramids. But the Stygian Club and the Pyramids have always been in conflict. This time, we plant those Talented Adepts’ death on the Stygian Club, they definitely will confront each other openly. What I care about now is how much they will suffer?”</p><p>That night.</p><p>All the foreign powers on Mist Source Island apprehended danger in every sound, just because the dozens of powerhouses of Pyramids attacked the Stygian Club’s encampment at Mist Source Island the first, four werewolves and the Viscount-Ranked vampires were killed in silence, bodies of them were taken away as well.</p><p>Soon after.</p><p>The other dozens of foreign powers had also suffered sneak attacks, and two organizations among them suffered disastrous losses. Checking the battle scene, without exception, werewolf bodies and vampire body parts were everywhere. In short, all of the traces indicated that the Stygian Club committed this.Original translation from Www。WangmamaRead。Com。</p><p>In the morning, the first ray of sunshine reached from the east and illuminated the entire Mist Source Island.</p><p>In the headquarters of Qingyuan Group.</p><p>Miao Hengfu received a message that Miao Wenlei and the seven other company security guards were all killed, and the killers were extremely arrogant. They not only acknowledged that they were the Reston, but also left a word that they were going to smash Miao Hengfu and Qingyuan Group.</p><p>“Assemble.”</p><p>Miao Hengfu was so furious that he assembled the security forces and his own private armed forces immediately, and then gave away a batch of firearms that was secretly purchased by him. Dozens of cars rushed to the place where Miao Wenlei’s body was abandoned, and the lead was Miao Hengfu.</p><p>However.</p><p>When the motorcade just left the Wolfpack City for more than a dozen kilometers, they were attacked by dozens of armed forces. In just a few minutes, Miao Hengfu lost lots of his men.</p><p>A few kilometers away.</p><p>Tang Xiu took a telescope and watched the fierce battle on the road at the foot of the mountain,  a satisfied smile appearing on his handsome face. In this battle, the majority of the people killed were of Miao Hengfu, while the people of the Reston had little loss.</p><p>“She showed up.”</p><p>Tang Xiu’s expression changed suddenly. Through the telescope, he clearly saw that a woman carrying a long knife appeared among those cars. She was like Death, who took away numerous lives after unsheathed the long knife. In just half a minute, the remaining 40 or 50 people were killed, including Miao Hengfu.</p><p>“The show has ended, it’s time to go.”</p><p>Tang Xiu put down the telescope and handed it to Ye Shisan, smiling.</p><p>Ye Shisan said with a smile, “Boss, you are awesome. You have defeated many enemies by simply using some elaborate schemes.”</p><p>“Stop flattering me.”</p><p>Tang Xiu smiled and said. However, just as he stepped forward, he was on his guard suddenly with a sharp light in his eyes.Original translation from Www。WangmamaRead。Com。</p><p>“Go back.”</p><p>Tang Xiu summoned the sword out of Dantian space. The resplendent sword light of dozens of meters long hewed down towards the foot of the hill, which resulted in more than a dozen big trees were chopped down and a groove of dozens of meters long and half a meter deep was left in the ground. A lightning-like shadow scurried out of the violent sword light.</p><p>An enemy?</p><p>Ye Shisan and Zidan summoned out their swords simultaneously and sprinted towards the shadow as fast as lightning. After a few seconds, they had appeared on both sides of the shadow.</p><p>“Stop it.”</p><p>Tang Xiu snapped before Ye Shisan and Zidan launched an attack.</p><p>The shadow turned out to be Zhenlei Duomu. She noticed that someone was hiding behind the scenes and kept watching on them while she was killing dozens of people. She hadn’t found the people who were watching them, but she noticed something strange when Tang Xiu and the other two left.</p><p>She didn’t expect a thunderbolt sword light would chop down towards her.</p><p>“Who are you?”</p><p>Being in panic, Zhenlei Duomu said angrily with a sword in her hand. She was terrified of that thunderbolt sword light that would have killed her if she didn’t dodge it quickly.</p><p>Tang Xiu slightly frowned. He had guessed at Zhenlei Duomu’s identities, but it never occurred to him that she was a highly qualified cultivator who was about to enter the Golden Core Stage.</p><p>After being silent for a while, Tang Xiu said slowly, “It is incredible that a foreign woman, especially a female leader of a foreign mafia was a cultivator.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
