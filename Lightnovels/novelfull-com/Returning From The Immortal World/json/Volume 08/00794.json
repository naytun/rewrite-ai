Despite Wang Rui’s timely reminder, there were still some combatants who were not able to fully hold their breath and inhaled some of the pale green poisonous mist.</p><p>Puff, puff, puff…</p><p>The glint and flash of cold blades were accompanied by flesh and blood that flew in all directions.</p><p>In just a minute or so, Wang Rui’s party of 20 men were heavily struck or killed by the Savage Mammoth’s people. Even his powerful right-hand man lost his combat power after being severely injured.</p><p>Viviani gritted her teeth with hatred evident inside her sapphire eyes. Her eyes tightly fixated on the two men in black robes. Her ability had only been recovered about 20 percent or so after her brief recovery, yet she had fallen into a perilous situation under the frenzied assault of these two men in black robes.</p><p>“Sacred Light, Blood Incarnadine!”</p><p>She suddenly retreated. As her back leaned on the cabin wall behind her, absolute resolution suffused in her eyes. She cut her finger with a sharp stiletto and a hazy milky glow diffused from her body, followed by a strand of blood flowing out like a tide and with a milky light that scattered around.</p><p>The light incarnadined with blood, seemingly woven into a big net, instantly stirred and trapped the faces of the two men in black robes. Right at the moment, she went all out to wave her arms. In a flash, the faces of the two men in black robes drastically changed. With ghastly paled faces, they attempted to retreat instead of getting entrapped within. But in the next moment, a flame blazed up above the scarlet sacred light and the dreadful heat it brought completely burned the two men in black robes in several breaths.</p><p>Up in midair, Ji Chimei’s pupils contracted while a flash of surprise gleamed inside them as she slowly said, “My Lord, this lass called Viviani was using the Sacred Light Blood Arts of the Brightwing race. This Sacred Light Blood Art is extremely vicious both to the enemy and the caster as it’s essentially burning their blood essence and life force—one of the ultimate forms of this forbidden art. The most important point of using this art is burning one’s life force.”</p><p>“You mean, you’ve already determined that Viviani’s true identity?” Tang Xiu’s brows pressed on and said, “Is she a member of Brightwing race from the Immortal World who descends and lives on Earth, or according to that theory on the Earth, did she get reincarnated and yet still retained her core bloodline and consciousness?”</p><p>“It’s likely so, my Lord.” Ji Chimei nodded and continued, “But for a member of Brightwing race of the Immortal World to want to descend on Earth, she or he must have a very formidable strength. At least at the stage of Golden Immortal. But, according to my knowledge, there has been no one among the Brightwing race who has reached the stage of Perfected Golden Immortal, just a few who have reached the Golden Immortal stage.”</p><p>“It seems like Viviani’s ancestor should have reached a Golden Immortal stage!” Tang Xiu said with a smile, “If so, she has a rather good aptitude and also has human blood. If she cultivates properly, there’s a high chance she could break through to the Golden Immortal stage in the future. If my estimation is correct, however, it’s highly likely that she can regain the memory of her previous incarnation once she ascends to the Immortal World. She could also probably reach the Perfected Golden Immortal based on her previous life’s experience in cultivation.”</p><p>“Do you want to recruit her as one of your subjects, my Lord?” asked Ji Chimei with a strange expression.</p><p>“I do have that idea.” Tang Xiu nodded.</p><p>“If that is so, my Lord must be mentally prepared. You may have to take the entire Brightwing race under your protection when we come back to the Immortal World,” said Ji Chimei.</p><p>Tang Xiu laughed casually and confirmed it, “Why would it be a problem for me taking the Brightwing race under my protection? It’s just a trivial issue.”</p><p>“Taking the Brightwing race under your protection is naturally an easy matter given your ability, my Lord.” Ji Chimei smilingly replied, “If so, shall this subject act now to rescue her?”</p><p>Tang Xiu watched the groups in the battle below with deep observation before shaking his head and saying, “No. People will only feel the most grateful when they are rescued after drowning, during their most desperate moments. For instance, you can see that Wang Rui fellow. Viviani was fleeing from a disaster, hence the helping hands from him just resulted in a bit of gratitude from her. It’s incomparable to if she received a helping hand that gives her the only glimmer of hope in despair.”</p><p>“Right you are, my Lord.” Ji Chimei sighed heartfeltly.</p><p>On the liner in the sea.</p><p>After using the Sacred Light Blood Art, Viviani had practically spent all the energy she had gained from her brief recovery. She had even burned her blood essence—an ability that consumed her life force, resulting in her completely losing the ability to continue to fight.</p><p>“It’s a dead end.”</p><p>Her slender body trembled a few times—so much so that she would have probably fallen onto the floor had she not reached out to support herself on the cabin’s wall. She only felt regret at this moment; regret that she had boarded Wang Rui’s ship. Had she not come aboard and just continued to drift away in the sea, the Savage Mammoth’s people wouldn’t have found her. Even if she would have been more distressed, she could at least be able to live much longer. And, most importantly, she wouldn’t have involved and implicated Wang Rui and his men.</p><p>“DIE…”</p><p>A low, hoarse, and deep voice exploded in the ears of everyone on the liner.</p><p>A sudden surge of aura followed the noise as a longsword swept across the sky. It slashed the necks of two men in black robes, killing them directly and leaving columns of splashing blood. The sword swept again as a figure flashed. A series of shadows kept moving toward the men in black robes who boarded the liner, sending them to their deaths one after another.</p><p>Wang Rui, who was resisting the onslaught of the enemy could feel the pressure turn lighter all of a sudden. Yet he didn’t feel happy in the slightest when he watched several of his enemies being killed directly. He knew perfectly well that the loss was too heavy even if they completely annihilated the Savage Mammoth’s people. All the men he brought here were ordinarily top-notch experts. Several of them had been killed just a step away from reaching the grandmaster level.</p><p>“Interesting.”</p><p>An erratic voice drifted from an old man on the bow of the liner. A hazy figure flashed as the silver-haired old man suddenly appeared in front of the old man expert who had slaughtered the men in black robes. Sharp scales that were more than 10 centimeters long protruded from his spine and two black sharp horns drilled out of his head as he pierced the back of his clothes. His aura kept surging out as he pressed forward toward the old man in front of him.</p><p>“Where did this freaking monster come from?”</p><p>A cold gleam flashed in the eyes of the Qingcheng Mountain’s old man. His longsword moved, creating layers of undulating and overlapping sword images, instantly shrouding the entirety of the silver-haired old man’s body.</p><p>The silver-haired old man maniacally laughed. He raised his arms and hacked down against the longsword’s strikes with his arms that were entirely covered with scales. At this moment, however, the silver-haired old man’s laughter suddenly came to an end as the scales on his arms were torn apart, revealing bones under two deep cuts that splashed with his blood.</p><p>“SCRAM!!!”</p><p>Right as his arms were wounded, the silver-haired old man’s eyes were filled with a vicious, fiendish, and yet bewitching charm. He blasted forward to deliver another heavy blow toward the Qingcheng Mountain’s old man. The enormous impact force was too sudden for the latter to avoid it as the blow hit his body, sending him flying and spurting out a mouthful of blood. The face of Qingcheng Mountain’s old man drastically changed and he kept onto his sword while stabilizing his figure, pushing back the silver-haired old man and then flashed to appear in front of Wang Rui.</p><p>“You’re screwed, brat. When and where did you provoke these monsters?”</p><p>Wang Rui watched the battle between these two old men from afar a moment ago. His heart violently shook after finding out that his family elder had been injured. He was perfectly aware of how powerful his elder was as the old man had broken through the grandmaster stage and reached a higher level.</p><p>“They have injected themselves with the genes of beasts and thus become mutated humans with the respective beasts’ abilities.”</p><p>Qingcheng Mountain’s old man sharply exhaled. He grabbed Wang Rui and dragged him as he dashed into the cabin in a flash. After throwing Wang Rui inside, he proudly stood in the entrance into the cabin and fiercely shouted, “Hey, old codger over there. Let’s have a talk!”</p><p>“You wanna negotiate with me?” Contempt flickered inside the silver-haired man’s eyes along with hostility as he smiled densely, “What qualifications do you have to negotiate with me, huh?”</p><p>“Hmph.” The Qingcheng Mountain’s old man coldly snorted and said, “You’re very formidable and are slightly stronger than my current cultivation level. That I admit. But you should also be aware of the fact that you also won’t survive today if I decided to go all out and perish together with you. I don’t know what hostility we have against each other, but I think we both should stop right here and now. Let’s get it straight to clear any misunderstanding between us.”</p><p>The silver-haired old man fell into silence. He was also aware of the terrifying strength his opponent possessed. Most importantly, he only had limited time to maintain his mutated body, only for at most 10 minutes and he would be suppressed if he couldn’t figure out the means to kill the enemy within this span of time.</p><p>“I want her dead!” The silver-haired man suddenly turned around and pointed to Viviani.</p><p>The Qingcheng Mountain’s old man glanced at Viviani and immediately furrowed his brows before turning to Wang Rui and shouting, “Tell me, does this foreign woman have something to do with you?”</p><p>“She’s a friend!” Wang Rui’s heart kept sinking inside the cabin. Never would he have imagined that even though his family elder had acted, he had no means to completely annihilate Savage Mammoths’ people. He had so little choice and had to rely on his last hope of negotiating with the enemy.</p><p>He realized he probably had no means to protect Viviani as he promised.</p><p>The Qingcheng Mountain’s old man coldly snorted. He immediately took a fast glance at Viviani and said, “This person is not our people, kill her as you like. But I have one condition. You can’t kill her on our ship!”</p><p>“No problem.” The silver-haired old man nodded.</p><p>With that said, he waved to the two men in black robes. The two men sprinted to Viviani’s front and stabbed her shoulders with sharp nails, then quickly dragged her onto the fishing boat.</p><p>The silver-haired old man then nodded toward the Qingcheng Mountain’s old man and smiled densely, “You’re very formidable Monseigneur. I hope we’ll have another opportunity to fight again. China, however, is a territory forbidden to us, so I very much hope that you can visit and sightsee in Europe.”</p><p>“I’ll surely visit Europe should there be an opportunity. No worries there” sneered the Qingcheng Mountain’s old man.</p><p>The silver-haired man strangely chuckled a couple of times and then blasted onto the fishing boat like a cannon shell. In a heavy tone, he ordered out without glancing at the captured Viviani, “Go back!”</p><p>At this time, Viviani’s heart died and all her hopes dissipated. She had been completely abandoned, yet she had neither resentment nor complaint. She realized that neither Wang Rui nor the Qingcheng Mountain’s old man was able to protect and keep her.</p><p>‘Perhaps this is the best ending! Though it’s a pity that I can never see him again. I can’t tell him myself that I’ve killed several of my enemies…’</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
