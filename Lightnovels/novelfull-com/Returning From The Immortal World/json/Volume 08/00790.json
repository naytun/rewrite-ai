The compensation Duanmu Lin gave Tang Xiu was not substantial, but he earned a share of the treasures from exploring the vestige. There was still half a month before May 1st, so Tang Xiu was not in a hurry.</p><p>He had taken care of most of the issues that were on Jingmen Island except to stay to accompany Gu Yan’er for a couple of days, after which he decided to return to Shanghai.</p><p>Amidst the shades of the night, two cars headed toward the Everlasting Feast Hall on the wide road, illuminated by street lights on both sides. Tang Xiu sat in the backseat of the front car, a smile on his handsome face, feeling very satisfied as he recalled the scene of the meeting with Duanmu Lin.</p><p>As long as Duanmu Lin and the ability users under his control didn’t make trouble with him, the Tang Family would be able to rest easy and he didn’t have to worry about doing anything. Tang Xiu was crystal clear about the promise he had been given before going to Mist Source Island, and the green book that was given to him was not taken back.</p><p>With that in hand, he could act and execute without prior approval from any authority—his privilege to exterminate others.</p><p>His eyes saw through the windows outside. It was already late at night, but some cars were still passing by. He finally felt a trace of weariness as he enjoyed the quietness and serenity inside the car after having been continuously plagued with things he had to deal with for many days.</p><p>Ring, ring, ring…</p><p>His cell phone rang for an unknown time, waking Tang Xiu up from his sleep. He found that the car had returned to the parking lot of the Everlasting Feast Hall. Mo Awu sat motionless in the driver’s seat, while Jin Shi and the rest scattered to the surroundings without disturbing him.</p><p>“How long have I slept?” asked Tang Xiu as he took his phone.</p><p>Mo Awu turned back and said, “Four hours, Boss. It’s 4:30 AM now. I decided not to disturb you since you were fast asleep.”</p><p>Tang Xiu faintly smiled and glanced at the phone screen. It was a call from Xue Yu. He immediately picked up the call and spoke, “Hello, Xue Yu. You haven’t slept yet?”</p><p>“There’s something I need to talk to you about, Tang Xiu.”</p><p>“Pray tell!”</p><p>“I just ascended in my cultivation last night and I kind of had an impulse to divine your future as well as some people who are related to you. I can’t make heads or tails about your future, but I kind of have the foresight for another situation. I don’t know whether the person is important to you, but there’s someone who is kind of facing peril in the near future. She’s now in the south…”</p><p>Tang Xiu was startled and quickly asked, “Who is it?”</p><p>“I don’t know who it is. The specifics escape me, but she’s a woman,” said Xue Yu with a forced smile. “Also, she should have just escaped in a hairbreadth. Her exact position is in the waters near Jingmen Island. Ah, that’s right–there’s also a lightning storm; she’s inside the lightning storm near Jingmen Island.”</p><p>“Any other clue?” asked Tang Xiu.</p><p>“Yes. She’s not Chinese and I don’t think she’s entirely human,” answered Xue Yu. “Pay attention to your safety if you wanna save her.”</p><p>Tang Xiu was stunned. He racked his brain, trying to recall anyone he knew who could be in danger.</p><p>‘Not a Chinese… and not a human? But she was very important to me?’</p><p>He kept mulling it over. He felt that Xue Yu wouldn’t have divined this issue for no reason at all, so he opened the door, looked at Mo Awu and ordered in a deep voice, “Send my order to the others, search the location nearby Jingmen Island that currently has a lightning storm, and do it fast!”</p><p>“Affirmative!” Mo Awu and the rest dispersed into the surroundings.</p><p>A few minutes later, Mo Awu rushed back and brought an intelligence officer of the Everlasting Feast Hall, reporting to Tang Xiu that 180 nautical miles in the water southeastward of Jingmen Island there was a thunderstorm along with nine meters of waves.</p><p>“Call the port to prepare the ship. Tell them we’ll be there immediately.”</p><p>Tang Xiu sat back in the car with a bit of a gloomy expression.</p><p>Whoosh…</p><p>A figure instantly appeared in front of the car at lightning speed. It was Ji Chimei with her walking stick. She sent out a voice transmission, “This one can follow you if you’re in a hurry, Lord.”</p><p>Staring blankly for a moment, Tang Xiu shook his head in distress. He opened the door and came to Ji Chimei and said in a deep voice, “Take me 180 nautical miles southeast from Jingmen Island, Chimei. Awu, all of you are to stay here.”</p><p>“Received your order!”</p><p>Mo Awu’s group knew how terrifyingly powerful Ji Chimei was. They could only watch with envy as Ji Chimei grabbed Tang Xiu’s hand and they streaked into the sky.</p><p>About flying, they were indeed were able to fly, but not so far as flying for thousands of miles. Currently, they could only maintain flying for half an hour. It also would fully consume their True Essence; even flying via a flying sword would only support them less than an hour.</p><p>In a flash, Tang Xiu and Ji Chimei appeared amidst the lightning storm, but the bad weather didn’t have the slightest effect on them.</p><p>“What are we here for exactly, Lord?” asked Ji Chimei curiously.</p><p>“Help me search the area within 100 kilometers with your perception. There’s a woman I need to find. She’s not a Chinese and… forget it. Just scour the area within 100 kilometers and see if there’s anyone around,” said Tang Xiu with a deep voice.</p><p>Respectfully nodding in response, Ji Chimei released a steady stream of spiritual sense that spread out in all directions. A 100 kilometers area was covered in a flash and she could ‘see’ everything within the radius no matter if it was a person, a fish, or even a drop of water.</p><p>“There’s an old fishing boat that was probably overturned by the waves about 14 kilometers southeastward from us. There are also two ships southwest of us, luxury liners with a total of 46 people. One of which is only boarded by a man with scantily dressed women. Northwest is a freighter with 24 non-Chinese people, armed with firearms and cold weapons like swords.”</p><p>“Huh? Not only that! 14 kilometers southeast, that old fishing boat should’ve been overturned by such a storm and swallowed by the black sea, right? How could it still drift safely all this time? Lord, there’s a woman on that boat. She’s not a Chinese. She’s blonde and is currently injured.”</p><p>“Then let’s head to the southeast,” said Tang Xiu immediately.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Ji Chimei flashed forward to the said direction without hesitation. Her figure along with Tang Xiu’s instantly appeared above the old fishing boat. As the two people came close, peculiar fluctuation energy could be sensed there, immediately making Tang Xiu clear about what Xue Yu said.</p><p>She said that this foreign woman was related to him, but didn’t say that this woman had a very close relationship with him. Yet, that slight difference in meaning still made Tang Xiu concerned.</p><p>It was Viviani!</p><p>She used to be a Saintess of the Holy See of the Vatican, possessing a special power, but not much of combat prowess. Her character was very pure and kind, and because of that, she ended up helping others a lot. Yet, she lost her home, loved ones, and nearly everything. He didn’t know what happened to her after he met her at the casino in Saipan. Back then, he asked her about her issue and had not been in contact until now.</p><p>“Are you going to save her, Lord?”</p><p>Ji Chimei and Tang Xiu stood on the deck with their perception covering Viviani who was inside one of the rooms in the cabin. At this moment, her appearance was far from goddess-like when Tang Xiu met her; she pretty much looked like a very broken beggar. No, it was even worse than that by the looks of the bruises all over her body. Of all the parts of tattered clothing on her body, only those that covered her sensitive parts were still intact.</p><p>“Let’s just wait first.”</p><p>Tang Xiu recalled what Ji Chimei said a while ago and immediately smiled. He came to a realization that it was not the storm that would threaten Viviani, but those 24 people on the freighter northeast from here. He clearly recalled that Viviani left Saipan for revenge and she now seemed to be hunted because of the old conflict.</p><p>“Let’s go to another room in the cabin and wait there. We won’t bother her for now,” ordered Tang Xiu in a low voice.</p><p>Ji Chimei nodded and followed Tang Xiu as they quietly went to another cabin room. Upon entering the room, she sat straightly cross-legged with her perception surveilling outside.</p><p>“Lord, the freighter northeastward should be catching up to this fishing boat in two hours. But those two liners should be catching up with the boat first,” Ji Chimei’s transmitted voice reported.</p><p>“There are people who have the leisure to sail in this bad weather?” Tang Xiu replied with a peculiar tone, “This is really strange. Chimei, who are the people on those two liners?”</p><p>“One of those two liners is boarded with twenty-plus men and they should be martial artists, while the other liner has a young man who looks like a playboy, judging by him having a good time with several women on it.”</p><p>A playboy having some pleasure?</p><p>Tang Xiu was dumbfounded and at a loss whether he should laugh or cry. An old adage indeed said that the world had a plethora of walks of life. Could it be that guy was not afraid of the increasing danger of the storm which could kill him in this vast sea?</p><p>“Tell me something, is this guy a cultivator, or does he have some peculiar abilities or something?” Tang Xiu’s expression changed and quickly asked with a voice transmission. “Else, we should immediately tell his crew to leave this water and go to Jingmen Island’s port for safety.”</p><p>“He shouldn’t be a cultivator and is unlikely to have some special ability either.” Ji Chimei shook her head and replied with a voice transmission, “He should be just a martial artist at the martial art grandmaster level, according to the martial artist ranks on Earth.</p><p>“A young martial artist grandmaster?”</p><p>Tang Xiu squinted and racked his brain to find such person he was familiar with, but found none similar. He immediately decided to ignore it and waited in silence.</p><p>Time fleeted by and half an hour quickly passed. As the two liners got closer and closer with the fishing boat, a large, staunch man on one of the liners finally discovered the fishing boat.</p><p>“Tell the boss we found a fishing boat here.”</p><p>The large, staunch man with a raincoat who used his telescope on the liner turned back and ordered the few men behind him.</p><p>“Got it!”</p><p>One of them answered and quickly entered the cabin.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
