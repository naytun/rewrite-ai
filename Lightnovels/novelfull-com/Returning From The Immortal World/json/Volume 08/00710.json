However, he did not want her to die on the underground fighting arena, for he was hoping that she would regain her memory about what had happened in the Immortal World and then settle the matters between the two of them thoroughly.</p><p>“Alright. I’ll go.”</p><p>Tang Xiu replied with an expressionless face and directly walked away. He did not want to spend more time idling with Han Qingwu, for it would make his mind keep recalling the years he spent together with Xue Qingcheng in the Immortal World. Those years of blissful and sweet times were now like a sharp knife shearing his heart.</p><p>A few minutes later, Tang Xiu came to the dining building of the Paradise Manor. He picked the spot by the window on the second floor at random, took out a cigarette and lit it up. He wondered why Han Qingwu wanted to become stronger. Even if that incident in Jingmen Island was the one that drove her to do so, it should not be a sufficient enough reason for her to participate in the underground fighting arena in a life and death combat to temper herself.</p><p>What is exactly the true reason?</p><p>The more he thought about it, the more he became confused and the more his expression turned serious.</p><p>“What are you thinking now?”</p><p>A fragrant scent came fluttering as Lulu, donned in a black leather jacket, approached with her loose long hair elegantly flowing. She asked the question after taking a seat on the opposite side of Tang Xiu.</p><p>Tang Xiu stretched out his brows, shook his head and said, “I’m just thinking over some small things. That reminds me of something. I’m also waiting for a friend to come here, and his name is Ji Mu. Tell your people to bring him here after he arrives.”</p><p>Lulu nodded, then took out her mobile and made a call. She then held her chin while staring at Tang Xiu, and said, “Tang Xiu, you gotta teach me how to cultivate. You can’t just favor one more than the other.”</p><p>With brows slightly pressed down, Tang Xiu asked, “I’m fine teaching you a cultivation technique, but why did you say I favor one more than the other?”</p><p>“Since I saw that vampire, Shanjenna, I realized that you also know how to cultivate. Not only you, but even Xiaoxue knows about it, thus I called Kang Xia,” said Ouyang Lulu.</p><p>“Why did you call her?” Tang Xiu blanked, baffled.</p><p>“Ugh, do you think I’m stupid?” Ouyang Lulu groaned. “I’m not sure if the other women have a vague and indescribable relationship with you, but I’m hella sure of Kang Xia. Because she would not have gone all out to manage the Magnificent Tang Corporation if it weren’t for you. I can even tell that you’re not managing all the affairs in the company at all since she’s the one who does it all.”</p><p>Tang Xiu already knew that Lulu was smart, but not to this degree. She definitely made a conjecture herself after calling Kang Xia, else with the latter’s ability and intelligence, it was absolutely impossible for her to speak out this statement easily.</p><p>Nonetheless, he never understood how a woman’s brain worked either. He, however, could faintly feel the many troubles he had with women, since one did not need to experience something first hand when examples were already there—like those Emperors in the olden times who housed 72 imperial concubines in the three palaces and six manors, which then led to wonderful scenes and plays in the imperial court for one generation after another. Didn’t those figures who had three wives and four concubines eventually have fires break out in their backyards?</p><p>Looking at Tang Xiu who fell silent, Ouyang Lulu’s heart suddenly jolted and she quickly said, “Honey, I’m not complaining about it, neither am I going to compete with Kang Xia about my status or whatever. As long as you care about me and remember that I’m your woman, it is already enough for me. Just like cultivation…”</p><p>She said that, but her hands under the table were clenched tightly. Lulu realized that Kang Xia’s position in Tang Xiu’s heart was quite firm. Her helping Tang Xiu to manage his business empire was already something she could not compete with. She firmly believed, however, that she could create a hole in the stone by dripping water on it constantly. Tang Xiu might have a frozen heart sealed by ice, but she could use her warm love to melt it and carve herself inside.</p><p>“I’ll stay here tonight,” said Tang Xiu after slowly raising his head.</p><p>Lulu’s eyes lit up and immediately looked full of joy while repeatedly nodding her head. She understood what Tang Xiu meant, and she could also notice the change in his attitude.</p><p>In the past, Tang Xiu always repelled her. Even if they did have sex a couple days ago, it was because she was the one who goaded and lured him to act. And yet, Tang Xiu never touched her again since two days ago. Saying that she did not feel at a loss inside was absolutely a lie, but she was also a woman who had her own restraint. She could not always resort to using aggressive means to lure him, neither she could act like she was desperate.</p><p>Sure enough. He does have a soft heart. Forcing him too excessively will only make me lose everything, and the losses will definitely outweigh the gains. For men, one must use a roundabout way to make his heart open a little before you want to capture his heart. Only then a woman can constantly deepen the relationship in the future, and eventually make him accept her until he cannot separate from her again.</p><p>At this time, Lulu’s smile was particularly brilliant, making her eyes into turn a crescent moon.</p><p>On a road near the Paradise Manor, a Maserati vroomed and rushed toward the venue, while Ji Mu, who was the driver was, was filled with a pleasantly surprised mood after learning from Chi nan that Tang Xiu was willing to see him.</p><p>He could not forget the scene he saw in Laoshan that night two days ago, neither he could erase the magical means Tang Xiu displayed from his mind. Certainly, he also saw the ruthless side of Tang Xiu when he ordered to kill those six monsters. Though he did feel somewhat disturbed inside, the enthusiasm to go all out in his life was entrenched deep inside his bones, and the very reason that made him decide to go forward.</p><p>He wanted to be stronger. He wanted to possess terrifying power like Tang Xiu. He was willing to take a risk and try even if he could only learn how to fly. Hence, he came to Shanghai after spending an enormous time and energy to prepare an extravagant gift, yet it was only a stalk of a two thousand years old wild ginseng that he bought for nearly one billion yuan from his grandfather's good friend.</p><p>Quickly, Ji Mu parked his car in the parking lot of the Paradise Manor. Before he got off the car, a middle-aged men came over and knocked on the window.</p><p>“You are?” Ji Mu asked, puzzled.</p><p>“Are you Mr. Ji? Ji Mu?” Asked the middle-aged man.</p><p>“I am,” said Ji Mu.</p><p>“Hello, Mr. Ji. My Boss asked me to wait for you here, and I was ordered to take you to him immediately after you arrived,” said the middle-aged man.</p><p>“Is your Boss, Tang Xiu?” Asked Ji Mu.</p><p>The middle-aged man hesitated for a moment and then said, “Mr. Tang could be considered as my Boss too, since he’s the man of our Boss.”</p><p>“Huh?” Ji Mu asked with a curious expression. “Who is your Boss then?”</p><p>“The surname of my Boss is Ouyang, from Jingmen Island,” answered the middle-aged man.</p><p>Ji Mu already knew that the Ouyang Family resided in Jingmen Island and even had met the young lady of the family a few times. Though he had no relationship with her at all since this young lady of the Ouyang Family was like a proud, lofty princess, he still had a fresh and vivid memory of her.</p><p>His expression suddenly changed as he looked at the middle-aged man and asked, “Isn’t your Boss called Ouyang Lulu?”</p><p>“You’re correct, Mr. Ji.” The middle-aged man smiled. “My Boss is indeed Ouyang Lulu. Do you know my Boss, by chance?”</p><p>There was, however, an indescribable feeling inside Ji Mu’s heart. He knew Ouyang Lulu was outstandingly beautiful, who he thought to be almost on par with Zhang Xinya, the woman he thought as the most beautiful. He did not expect that she would be Tang Xiu’s woman. However, when he recalled Tang Xiu’s status and identity, he suddenly felt relieved, since he thought that for such a terrifying existence like Tang Xiu, only a beauty the likes of the Ouyang Lulu’s level who could be worthy to be with him.</p><p>“Yeah, I met her a couple of times,” said Ji Mu perfunctorily. He took out the gift from the trunk and followed the middle-aged man into the dining building. When he noticed that Ouyang Lulu was sitting by the window and was chat with Tang Xiu, he immediately stepped forward and said with a prudent smile, “Brother Tang, Big Sis-in-law, I’m disturbing you, am I?”</p><p>Brother Tang? Big Sis-in-law?</p><p>Tang Xiu was struck with a feeling of being at a loss whether he had to cry or laugh by Ji Mu’s address. He just met this fella once, how come they were so familiar already? On the contrary, Lulu, who felt sweet inside after hearing him address her as “Big Sis-in-law”, secretly appreciated Ji Mu for that. After getting up quickly, she stood by the table and said with a smile, “Ji Mu, I never thought the friend Tang Xiu mentioned would be you. It seems like my man is so outstanding that he even befriended the young master of the Ji Family from Changxi City. Anyways, have a chat with him, then. I’m going to the kitchen to prepare the meal and a good bottle of good wine for you.”</p><p>After watching Lulu leave, only then did Tang Xiu make a gesture to Ji Mu to take a seat on the opposite side, and then asked, “Brother Ji Mu, why did address us like that for?”</p><p>Ji Mu pushed the four gift boxes tied up by colored ropes and said with a smile, “It’s been a long time since the last time we met in Laoshan last year. I can still remember the elegant style and demeanor you had back then, Brother Tang! You see, I’m kinda unoccupied recently, so I came to Shanghai to visit you.”</p><p>“And what are these?” Tang Xiu pointed to the four gift boxes.</p><p>“I recently got some stuff, so I thought to prepare them as a gift to you since I came to visit. I hope you can accept these, Brother Tang!”</p><p>Tang Xiu squinted his eyes and shot a deep gaze at Ji Mu. The sudden visit did as well the gifts he had prepared must contain a deep meaning. After being silent for a while, he slowly asked, “Is there anything I can help you with, Ji Mu?”</p><p>“No no no.” Ji Mu stared blankly for a moment and immediately shook his head. “I really just wanted to visit you because I admire your abilities, Brother Tang. There are only a few people worth of my admiration nowadays, so I decided to get closer to you and get along better, that’s all. That’s what I came here for.”</p><p>“Hahaha.” Tang Xiu could not help laughing. “You know, the way you make friends is kind of strange. Anyhow, I’ll receive this gift no matter your other purposes. If you don’t rush back tonight, stay and spend the night here!”</p><p>“Alright!” Replied Ji Mu, feeling happy.</p><p>Ring ring ring…</p><p>The mobile phone in Tang Xiu’s pocket suddenly rang. When he took it out and looked at the caller on the screen, his expression immediately turned strange. After some thought, he answered the call without asking Ji Mu to leave and spoke, “How do you remember to call me, Shaoyang?”</p><p>Qin Shaoyang’s voice then came out from the mobile phone, “Brother Tang, I’m in Shanghai now, do you have some time to have a meal together? I… there’s something I want to discuss with you.”</p><p>Tang Xiu had a business cooperation with Qin Shaoyang, so he naturally did not reject it. He then covered the phone’s mic and looked at Ji Mu, saying, “A friend from Beijing said that he wants to see me to discuss something. How about I call him here and we all have a drink together?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
