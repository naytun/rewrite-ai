When the water curtain finally formed, a beautiful young girl emerged.</p><p>“Poseinu, have you found them?”</p><p>Wu Jie stopped and asked.</p><p>Poseinu nodded with a gloomy expression, she then took out a small camera and started to play the video inside it.</p><p>“Scoundrel.”</p><p>After Wu Jie watched the video, his old face was already full of anger, and he stroked the golden stick in his hand on the ground hard, the smashing waves of air destroyed the entire tent.</p><p>“Original translation from Www。WangmamaRead。Com。”</p><p>The video showed a messy mountain forest, where the bodies of his dozens of subordinates were being bitten and swallowed by beasts in the forest. In the vicinity of these bodies, there were several bodies of Bloodkin members, who got the mark of the Stygian Club.</p><p>Poseinu said in a deep voice, “War Intelligence Elder, after my investigation, it’s the members of the Stygian Club that killed Siou; besides, there are also bodies of the Darksoul squad members.”</p><p>Wu Jie said coldly, “Poseinu, have you found out where Keith Moore and his subordinates are stationed?”</p><p>Poseinu replied, “Yes, they’re in Mixed Summit City. However, Siou’s target has disappeared. We’ve spent a lot of effort but failed to find him.”</p><p>Wu Jie snorted, “There are only two possibilities. The first is that Tang Xiu has been taken by the people of the Stygian Club; the second is that Tang Xiu has escaped and hid. Anyway, we have to do something. Tell Berdot (the War Ghoul Elder), let him personally take his people to Mixed Summit City. Once Tang Xiu shows up, kill him directly. If not, give Keith Moore a lesson.”</p><p>Poseinu said in a hurry, “Your War Intelligence Elder, are we really going to declare war on the Stygian Club? If I didn’t guess wrong, this time Sir Keith Moore came to Mist Source Island, he must bring a lot of superiors of the Stygian Club, I worry about that…”</p><p>Wu Jie said in an awe-inspiring voice, “Don’t worry. This time, the people coming to Mist Source Island from our Pyramids are much more than it seems. Although there have been some conflicts between us and the Stygian Club, both parties have not come to an open break. But now… Sir Keith Moore has to pay the price.”</p><p>Poseinu nodded and said, “I will inform the War Ghoul Elder Berdot of it right now.”</p><p>Wu Jie waved his hand and looked in the direction of Twin Brook City gloomily. This time, among so many confidants he brought, Siou was definitely his right-hand man. And the Talented Adept power Siou managed was also his most loyal armed force. The loss this time was so serious for him that he had begun to feel bad.</p><p>Mixed Summit City.</p><p>A street in the north of the city, the Stygian Club was stationed. Sir Keith Moore smashed the teacup in his hand, his eyes were filled with a violent temper. Basil and Alody, who stood in front of him, bowing their heads, dared not to speak anything, the atmosphere was out of breath.</p><p>“Four count-ranked warriors of the Darksoul squad, have been killed like this? What are you doing now? I trained four count-ranked warriors with so much toil, don’t you know how much they cost me?”</p><p>“Oriental cultivators… No matter how mysterious and powerful the Oriental cultivators are, it couldn’t be your excuse for the failure. Find him, find the bastard. I will hack him to death.”</p><p>“…”</p><p>Having vented his anger, Keith Moore gradually calmed down.</p><p>Basil felt relieved and plucked up the courage to say, “In fact, their strength is not very strong. Even Tang Xiu, who is the strongest in his team, can only match us at most. But the sword he uses is too powerful. I can feel the power stored in his sword is so tremendous that even the Darkfiend Artifact of our Stygian Club cannot match.”</p><p>Keith Moore was stunned and asked suddenly, “Are you sure?”</p><p>Nodding his head affirmatively, Basil said, “I am sure. Tang Xiu’s own strength is not very powerful. I’m convinced I can join hands with Alody to defeat him if I fail to beat him only myself. But his sword is so strong and strange, so we…”</p><p>Keith Moore waved his hand to interrupt Basil, showing a look of unrestrained greed in his eyes, he said with a deep voice, “In this case, I’ll do it myself. Help me find out where he is as soon as possible! Besides, inform all members of the other two Darksoul squads to come here and report to me as soon as possible.”</p><p>“Yes, sir.”</p><p>Basil was defeated so badly in a previous battle with Tang Xiu, which was the ultimate humiliation for him. Hearing that Keith Moore would beat Tang Xiu himself, Basil had some expectations of the fight. If TangXiu was killed, Basil would not suffer humiliations any longer. Even if Tang Xiu survived the battle, he would suffer enormous losses.</p><p>“Master, I need your herald tally. Otherwise, the other two members of the Darksoul squad won’t obey my order.”</p><p>“Here you go…”</p><p>Keith Moore handed Basil the herald tally without hesitation.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
