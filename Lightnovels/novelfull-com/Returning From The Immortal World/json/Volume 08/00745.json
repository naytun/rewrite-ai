What surprised him was that there was no improvement and was similar to their previous state, neither did they suffer much damage. But as his consciousness entered his Dantian, only then did Tang Xiu become shocked by its internal changes.</p><p>Inside the vast space of his Dantian, the vortex black hole had completely disappeared, replaced by a miniature world. The previously empty space now had numerous suns, moons, and stars of sesame size. The colors of the stars were varied—red, orange, yellow, green, azure, blue, and purple. The dazzling miniature world was imaginary like a dream.</p><p>Compared to the vast, infinite universe, this was indeed a miniature space, but the area was also hundreds or thousands of times larger than the space inside his Dantian. As Tang Xiu’s thought spread, he was shocked. His thought was able to cover the entire space. Under his precise perception, he found that space was unexpectedly expanding, albeit slowly.</p><p>Other than that, Tang Xiu also saw a tree that had grown tens of meters high, looking verdant and lush. This was the seed of the Heavenly Path Universe Tree that had germinated, taken roots, and grew up gradually. There was also a long sword with dazzling multicolored lights quietly floating near the tree trunk.</p><p>“What about other objects?”</p><p>Tang Xiu once stored a lot of objects inside his Dantian, but they all disappeared without a trace at some time. He wanted to clarify the reason and cause, so he now quietly took the Bloodguzzler Dagger into the space inside his Dantian.</p><p>Buzz, buzz…</p><p>Right at the moment the Bloodguzzler Dagger entered the Dantian space, a sucking force was transmitted from the longsword and the energy contained in the Bloodguzzler Dagger could not resist but being drawn and devoured by the longsword, and the invisible energy even affected the dagger as it started to corrode.</p><p>“What the? What’s going on?”</p><p>Tang Xiu quickly controlled the Bloodguzzler Dagger as fast as possible to leave the Dantian space. But as the dagger itself was thoroughly ruined in just a few seconds, he wanted to cry but had no tears. The dagger now was nothing but scrap iron and did not even have any traces of a spirit weapon anymore.</p><p>“Could it be that the longsword…”</p><p>Tang Xiu’s thought moved and instantly fused into the longsword. Something inexplicable happened as he discovered that he could actually control it with his mind and released it outside his body. It was completely under his control as he manipulated it with his fingers. He also felt that an enormous energy was contained inside it.</p><p>“This is a weapon of divinity. Definitely better than the best immortal weapon longsword I once used when I was a Supreme in the Immortal World. It seems that those things I have stored inside my body were all devoured by this long sword.”</p><p>He previously felt a bit distressed, but the feeling then vanished in an instant since he was able to fully control this long sword. No matter how great those objects were, it was nothing compared to this Divine Weapon that really belonged to him. Tang Xiu could even feel the spirit inside it. The energy was very strong, but its sentience and wisdom were still very weak. It would take time and unceasing accumulation before it could birth into a sword spirit and become an immortal or divine weapon that really belonged to himself.</p><p>“Oh?”</p><p>Suddenly, Tang Xiu found there was a planet larger than the rest inside his Dantian space, while the Primal Chaos Force in his Dantian continuously fused and came out of the planet. As he circulated his cultivation according to the route of the Heavenly Art of Cosmic Genesis, the leaking Primal Chaos Force from the planet crazily surged out and entered the meridians inside his body, whereas the majority of the Primal Chaos force inside his meridians gushed out to fuse into that planet.</p><p>The discovery baffled Tang Xiu. But after a long period of studying it, he discovered that this so-called planet was once the phantom that swallowed countless stars in the universe, and was eventually formed from the absorbed Primal Chaos Force.</p><p>In other words, every planet was formed by energy. The planet would become larger as long as there was more energy. It seemed that it was not difficult to form a real planet.</p><p>After a long time, Tang Xiu let out a bitter smile as his closed eyes slowly opened. He only felt helpless after finding that these planets were formed from Primal Chaos Force. Nonetheless, it was still a good deed since the universe and these worlds were formed inside with him as its creator, the God. However, how much Primal Chaos Force would be needed to build tens of millions of planets that then accumulated and turned into a completely huge planet!</p><p>“You’re awake?”</p><p>It was unknown when Xue Yu had put on her bra. She was now looking at Tang Xiu from the side. Though she found that Tang Xiu had woken up and was somewhat shy and blushing, she still looked at him straight on.</p><p>Tang Xiu felt awkward and embarrassed at this moment. He wanted to ask the condition of her body. It was completely a critical moment, and he was forced to do so. He could still clearly remember the pain she bore previously. After letting out a dry cough, Tang Xiu then sat up and smilingly said, “Are you… alright?”</p><p>Xue Yu also sat up, shook her head and gently replied, “I’m fine. And thanks.”</p><p>“You’re thanking me?” Tang Xiu was dumbfounded. Why would she thank me for having taken her as his woman?</p><p>“You told me before that it’s not easy to sense the flow of Qi. And that it would need a year and a half to control it, and it would still need a year or two if I wanted to turn my cultivation into True Essence. I don’t know what means you used, but I’m sure I’ve stepped into the cultivation path, becoming a cultivator who has True Essence.”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>Tang Xiu suddenly recalled the situation previously and immediately took Xue Yu’s wrist to feel her pulse. Half a minute later, a strange expression climbed up his face, because he found that not only did True Essence exist inside her body, but it’s quantity was also high. The harmonization between Yin and Yang turned out to have propelled Xue Yu up to the early level of the Foundation Establishment Stage.</p><p>“Directly jumping up and skipping the Qi Refining Stage?”</p><p>Tang Xiu’s mouth couldn’t help but twitch a few times. It was quite unbelievable and absurd at the same time, and yet he still had to accept it as a fact. Didn’t this mean that it was misfortune turning into a blessing for Xue Yu?</p><p>Xue Yu, on the other hand, was unaware of Tang Xiu’s thoughts. There was a smile on her flawless beautiful face as she said, “I should be counted as a cultivator now, right? When can you teach me some magical spells?”</p><p>“You can do it at any time if you want to learn it.” Tang Xiu could not help laughing. “However, you should first tell me about this medicated diet.”</p><p>Upon hearing his inquiry, Xue Yu’s face slightly changed as she replied in a low voice, “That… I’m really sorry. It was also my first time boiling this medicated diet hot pot. You looked horrifying before, and it was probably very dangerous for you. Are you all right now?”</p><p>Tang Xiu shook his head and said with a smile, “Not only am I okay, but I also greatly benefited from it. Originally, I thought that the medicated died would only have strong and potent medicinal force given how expensive its ingredients were, but I didn’t expect it to contain a strange energy. It drove tremendous changes inside my body. It seems like there are indeed many good things in your Miao region!”</p><p>“Do you want to accompany me back?” Asked Xue Yu with a smile upon hearing it.</p><p>“I’m afraid I won’t have the time in the short term,” said Tang Xiu after he thought about it. “Wait until I’m done handling some matters! I’m going to Kanas again later since I have researched some points of the Six Starlight Array, so I might be able to make a new progress if I go there and see the array again. Maybe I can crack down this Six Starlight Array directly and take that Immortal Trove.”</p><p>“Take me with you when you go to Kanas,” said Xue Yu quickly. “I also want to see what objects are stored inside the Immortal Trove.”</p><p>“Alright!” Tang Xiu directly agreed.</p><p>Immediately after, both of them turned silent and the embarrassing atmosphere made them feel awkward, neither spoking as they did not know what to say. After some time passed by, Tang Xiu could not bear any longer and asked, “Shall we rest for a while?”</p><p>Xue Yu looked at the sky outside. She then nodded and said, “Alright. Will you accompany me?”</p><p>“OK!”</p><p>The two embraced each other and soon fell asleep.</p><p>It was unknown how long passed as the sleeping Tang Xiu was awakened by the buzzing noise of his ringing cell phone. Xue Yu, who was sleeping in his arms, opened her eyes and asked, “Someone is calling?”</p><p>Tang Xiu nodded, stretching out his hand to take the mobile. He saw that the caller was Kang Xia, and after connecting it through, he asked, “What’s up, Kang Xia?”</p><p>“We’re in Shanghai now, Boss. Where are you?” Said Kang Xia with a smile.</p><p>“Didn’t you say that you’d be here about two or three days later? How come you arrived in Shanghai today?” Tang Xiu stared blankly and asked in a baffled tone.</p><p>“Boss, are you confused or something?” Kang Xia was at a loss whether he had to cry or laugh. “That was three days ago!”</p><p>Tang Xiu quickly looked at the date, finding that it was indeed three days later. He didn’t expect that drinking a bowl of medicated diet, experiencing a crisis, gaining benefits, taking Xue Yu as his woman, and taking a nap for a while turned out to have spent such a long time.</p><p>“Head straight to Bluestar Villa! I’m going there now.”</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>After hanging up, Tang Xiu put the mobile phone on the bedside table and said, “There’s something I gotta do, so I have to go first. Kang Xia and some people from the company have arrived in Shanghai, and I need to discuss the project tender with them.”</p><p>“Is it Kang Xia, the CEO of the Magnificent Tang Corporation?”</p><p>“Yeah!” Tang Xiu nodded.</p><p>“She’s very beautiful,” commented Xue Yu.</p><p>Tang Xiu could not tell if there was any meaning from her comment. But he heard Fatty Yuan once saying that he must not praise another woman before a woman, hence did not reply to her comment and instead said with a smile, “I should be free tomorrow evening, so I’ll come over to take you to dinner.”</p><p>“Alright.”</p><p>Xue Yu felt a bit unwilling, but she still managed to control her emotions and then nodded. Prior to this, her relationship with Tang Xiu was not a husband and wife in reality, and she only remembered him occasionally and felt that she should miss him. But saying that she had affection towards him, she only liked him a bit and there was not much feelings attached. But now was different, because she had given her whole self to Tang Xiu, both in the heart and body—and thus felt reluctant to separate from him, even for half a day.</p><p>“Alright. Let’s get dressed!”</p><p>Tang Xiu smiled and kissed her forehead, then took a new set of clothes from his interspatial ring.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
