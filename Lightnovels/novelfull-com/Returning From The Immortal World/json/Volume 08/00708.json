In order to realize the plan to set up the Universe Literature Media company, he stayed in Blue City for some time, aiming to unearth some excellent students in the Regal Classical Music Academy.</p><p>As a result, he accidentally bumped into Zhang Zitao there, and due to a small dispute, his friend suffered a bit of a loss and even got threatened despite acting low key. And now, he ran into Zhang Zitao again in Shanghai. Though he displayed a humble and scared expression on the surface, he secretly made up his mind to really pack up this fella by himself if this guy were to act rampant and unbridled.</p><p>But who would have thought that instead of provoking him again, this guy acted like he did not want to continue the dispute and neither did he want to bother him?</p><p>After seeing Zhang Zitao, Ni Jie followed the direction of his sight and her eyes then landed on Xue Yu, who was quietly reading a book. Despite being a woman, she was still amazed by her looks and was also subdued by her aura. She finally realized why Zhang Zitao did not see her even though she stood in front of him.</p><p>“Is that young lady a friend of yours, Zhang Zitao? Why don’t you introduce us to her?” Ni Jie was originally pursued by Zhang Zitao. Even though she kept ignoring him, yet she too enjoyed the feeling of being pursued. But now she felt sour and upset upon seeing this that guy had a new target.</p><p>“Sshh… you’re bothering…”</p><p>Zhang Zitao angrily shifted his gaze to Ni Jie. But when he saw her, his voice came to a halt instantly, and was seemingly afraid of being found out as he quickly glanced at Xue Yu, and then hurriedly got up and said with a smile, “Little Jie, how come you are here? I was just thinking about things, so I did not notice you, cough, cough…”</p><p>Ni Jie shot him a harsh glare and mocked, “Heh, I can tell that that beauty has captured your soul, isn’t that right? Speaking about her, her beauty is indeed outstanding and is definitely able to topple a kingdom. With an aura like an orchid in a secluded valley, her figure still looks evident even though she’s only sitting there quietly, and her figure is definitely outstanding too. No wonder you’re completely bewitched.”</p><p>Zhang Zitao let out a hollow laugh, and then explained, “Little Jie, I don’t know her either. Also, you’re very outstanding in my eyes.”</p><p>“Oh, shut it.” Ni Jie quickly waved her hand. “I’m not interested in you. I’d love to help you hook up with that beauty if you could stop pestering me. Alright, Shaoyang just came to Shanghai and we have something to discuss. Go appreciate your beauty yourself!”</p><p>“Young Master Zhang, we won’t accompany you,” said Qin Shaoyang with a smile.</p><p>Fickle as he was, it was simply Zhang Zitao’s natural instinct being fond of beauty. And in his eyes, Ni Jie was also his favorite woman. Now that she had a date with another man, it made him quite vexed. Just as Qin Shaoyang’s voice faded away, he immediately said, “Hold on.”</p><p>“Is there something, Young Master Zhang?” Asked Qin Shaoyang.</p><p>With knitted brows, Zhang Zitao said, “Who are you really? How can you know Little Jie?”</p><p>“Haven’t I already told you when we met in Blue City?” Said Qin Shaoyang with a smile. “I’m just a nobody who does a small business to make a bit of pocket money to take back home. I’m nothing but a dwarf compared to you, Young Master Zhang.”</p><p>Zhang Zitao’s brows furrowed deeper. The more modest Qin Shaoyang was, the more he felt that this fella was not as simple as he looked. Because he knew Ni Jie’s character - proud like a phoenix - and ordinary people would not be able to enter her eyes at all.</p><p>However, he was proud to the bone. This was Shanghai—his territory, and the woman who did not look at him in the eyes turned out to be taken by another man. Therefore, his complexion turned cold and he said in a heavy tone, “I don’t give a damn about your status or who you are. Stay away from Ni Jie, else I won’t mind to cash in what I told you in Blue City.”</p><p>Qin Shaoyang shot a deep look at him before he suddenly said with a smile, “I finally get it now why you kicked an iron plate a while ago. You know, there’s a line stated in the Art of War: Know thyself and know thy enemies, and only then will you be victorious in battle. You have yet to figure out the identity of who you are facing, yet you dare to act arrogant and provoke others. Could it be that you are not afraid that you will court a calamity upon your family?”</p><p>Zhang Zitao was shaken inwardly. He faintly felt that the last sentence spoken by Qin Shaoyang was somewhat familiar. After a while, he suddenly recalled it. It was at that time when he provoked Tang Xiu and he spoke these words to him.</p><p>Could it be…</p><p>With a change in expression, Zhang Zitao blurted, “Do you know Tang Xiu?”</p><p>“How can I not know him? Tang Xiu is the idol of all the scions and young ladies of the prominent families in Beijing. What’s wrong? Judging from what you said, you seem to know Tang Xiu too?”</p><p>Zhang Zitao’s heart tightened and he asked, “What is your relationship with Tang Xiu? Who exactly are you?”</p><p>At the side, Ni Jie looked at Zhang Zitao with some pity and said, “As far as I know, you went to Beijing last year, yet you boasted to those scoundrel buddies of yours that you got the qualification to enter the Kangde Club, and then squandered a lot of money there for a couple of days. Don’t tell me you don’t know the owner of Kangde Club?”</p><p>“What?” Zhang Zitao was as though getting zapped by thunder, making him limp and numb.</p><p>Kangde Club? The highest-ranked club in Beijing that numerous scions of notable families in the country have been dreaming to be eligible to enter?</p><p>Is this guy… the Big Boss?</p><p>Finally, Zhang Zitao understood what it meant “playing the pig to swallow the tiger”. That amazing fella who established the Kangde Club, whether in terms of wealth, status, or network, each of them was enough to crush him. His father may have a high status in Shanghai and his family might be a genuinely rich and powerful clan, but…</p><p>Qin Shaoyang slightly smiled and took out his business card, handed it over to Zhang Zitao and said, “I know Tang Xiu because we are friends and also partners in business. This time, if it wasn’t because I needed to see him and also have something to take care of in Shanghai, I would not have dared to ignore the threat from the local tyrant here, neither would I dare to easily disregard you and visit Shanghai.”</p><p>This time, Zhang Zitao really wanted to weep. Never did he think that the bad luck he carried on his shoulder would smash his own heel due to his own fart. The matter he provoked Tang Xiu that day could be said as let the bygones be bygones, but he even provoked Qin Shaoyang, who played the pig to eat the tiger today. The only thing that made him feel relieved was that he did not drag things further with the threat he said in Blue City previously. Otherwise, he would have really courted a huge trouble if he directly started an attack the moment he saw Qin Shaoyang.</p><p>However, the male chauvinism inside him prevailed. Ni Jie was in front him, and he did not want to bow his head and admit his mistake, thus he could only bite the bullet, “Even if you’re the owner of the Kangde Club, I won’t change my original intention—STAY AWAY from Ni Jie, for she will definitely be my woman in the future. As for Tang Xiu… He’s my uncle.”</p><p>Uncle?</p><p>Qin Shaoyang blanked and revealed a strange expression. Though he did obtain the news that Zhang Zitao just kicked an iron plate some time ago due to provoking a powerful figure, he did not know who the person was. But Tang Xiu was surnamed Tang, while Zhang Zitao’s surname was Zhang. How come they were related as uncle and nephew? Could it be that Tang Xiu and Zhang Yueming had become sworn brothers?</p><p>At this time, Ni Jie was similarly dumbfounded. She naturally knew Tang Xiu and even vividly remembered him, since he was also at the scene when that ugly woman slapped her in the face last year. Yet, she did not expect that Tang Xiu was so powerful.</p><p>It should be just the same surname with the same name, right?</p><p>Ni Jie pondered for a moment, as her eyes then fell on Zhang Zitao. She had a faint delusion that this guy seemed to be somewhat different than before. For example, he did not press Qin Shaoyang the moment he met him, and now that he finally knew of his unusual identity, he did not bow his head either.</p><p>Could it be that… his love for me is really sincere?</p><p>The thought crossed Ni Jie’s mind, and she now had a different impression toward the guy. Though she did not have much interest in him, she could opt to become friends with this fella if he could really mature.</p><p>In the corner of the coffeehouse.</p><p>Xue Yu put down the book in her hand, picked her handbag she just bought, and prepared to leave. Though she heard the conversation between Zhang Zitao and those people and even heard Tang Xiu’s name being mentioned, she did not want to be involved in the discussion. To her, Tang Xiu was an outstanding man, and for him to be acquainted with many people was just normal.</p><p>Zhang Zitao, who had been paying attention to Xue Yu and now saw that she was about to leave, felt somewhat torn inside. After weighing matters, he decided to go out and then spoke, “Little Jie, there’s something I need to take care off, so I’ll go first. I’ll look for you again another day.”</p><p>Ni Jie also noticed that Xue Yu was preparing to leave. Now, hearing Zhang Zitao’s words, the change of impression she just had toward the guy instantly vanished, turning into irritation and disgust. She then waved her hand and said, “Just go take care of your things. Don’t worry about us. Also, you don’t need to look for me later since I already have tons of things to deal with.”</p><p>Zhang Zitao seemed to not hear anything she said, and just shot a warning look toward Qin Shaoyang, and then chased after Xue Yu who had just left the coffeehouse. The distance between them was a few hundreds of meters away, so he rapidly caught up and then blocked Xue Yu’s path, saying, “Hello, I’m Zhang Zitao. May I know your name, young lady?”</p><p>Xue Yu frowned and halted her pace. From the conversation between this guy with Ni Jie and Qin Shaoyang, she thought that Zhang Zitao was the type of man who was fickle in love, the kind she never liked. However, on the account of Tang Xiu’s face, she still spoke, albeit indifferently, “My name is Xue Yu, but you can call me Auntie.”</p><p>Auntie?</p><p>Zhang Zitao was dumbfounded. But since he was not someone who could be taken advantage of, he asked after hesitating, “Why? Why should I address you like that?”</p><p>“Well, I’m Tang Xiu’s woman,” said Xue Yu.</p><p>“WHAT?”</p><p>Zhang Zitao was utterly speechless, and his whole being was as though getting zapped by thunder again. He had imagined numerous identities Xue Yu might have, and even already predicted that she already had a boyfriend or was married already. But never once did he ever predict that she turned out to be Tang Xiu’s woman.</p><p>“You call Tang Xiu as your uncle, so you naturally should call me Auntie.” Xue Yu nodded. “Anyways, I’m going to Bluestar Villa Complex later, do you want to go with me?”</p><p>“SHIT… I'VE GOTTEN RID OF BY HIM—UNCLE.”</p><p>Zhang Zitao was completely depressed and roared inwardly. He shook his head and desperately put on a theatrical look, saying, “No no no, I… I have other things to do. I-I can’t go to Bluestar Villa Complex. I-If you…If you see Tang Xiu, please send him my regards.”</p><p>With that said, he ran away with his tail between his legs.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
