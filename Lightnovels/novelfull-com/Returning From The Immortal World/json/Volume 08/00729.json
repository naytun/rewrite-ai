The place he spent the night in was a luxurious villa belonging to Ji Mu, who even changed the main bedroom bedding and gave the room to Tang Xiu, while he himself spent the night in a guest room on the first floor.</p><p>Knock, knock…</p><p>The door was knocked and as Tang Xiu opened it, he saw Han Qingwu smilingly standing outside while holding her handbag.</p><p>“You got up early?” Asked Tang Xiu.</p><p>“Not too early.” Said Han Qingwu after entering the bedroom behind Tang Xiu. “I heard some sounds from your room, so I came over. Anyways, are we going back to Shanghai directly or stroll around Changxi? Yu Hong called this morning kinda complaining about it.”</p><p>Tang Xiu thought about it and then asked, “Is there something urgent for you to hurry back? If you don’t, let’s return in the afternoon or tonight.”</p><p>“Alright,” said Han Qingwu immediately.</p><p>“Okay!” Tang Xiu readily agreed. He hesitantly agreed last night to return back together to Shanghai with Li Laoshan, so he was going to call him directly later. However, Han Qingwu’s following words made him give up on making the call.</p><p>“Let’s have breakfast first, Tang Xiu. After which, how about accompanying me to the ancient town in Yandang? I heard the scenic view there is great, and I’ve always wanted to have a look. I haven’t had a chance to do so until now due to tons of things I needed to tend to. While in passing, I’m gonna call Yu Hong too, so we can have lunch together.”</p><p>Tang Xiu pondered and said, “I’m afraid I’ll have to attend to some important matters shortly. By then, I’d like you to approve my leave later.”</p><p>Upon hearing it, Han Qingwu immediately rolled her eyes at him in a charming manner. With an expression of being at a loss whether she had to cry or laugh, she said, “To think that you are actually haggling over this thing with me. Hmph, so be it then. Who told me to be in a good mood in these two days? Alright, I promise you.”</p><p>Tang Xiu was left speechless. He did have a lot of things to take care of in the near future, nonetheless. On the one hand, he had to ponder about making more money, while in the other, the tender for the Magnificent Tang Corporation’s construction project in Shanghai was going to be held as well, and a lot of things must be handled by then. There was also one other thing. He did not go to Jingmen Island to see Gu Yan’er to celebrate the Chinese New Year before, so he planned to go there in the near future. If there was more time to spare, he also wanted to go to Nine Dragons Island while in passing.</p><p>After washing his face and rinsing his mouth, Tang Xiu came to the first floor with Han Qingwu. There, he saw Ji Mu in an apron taking two dishes out of the kitchen.</p><p>“Brother Tang, Miss Han, you two are already up! Anyways, come eat breakfast. It’s my cooking today, so you gotta try and enjoy it,” said Ji Mu cheerfully.</p><p>“You did the cooking?” Asked Tang Xiu with a strange expression.</p><p>Ji Mu straightened up his chest and proudly said, “Of course. I was originally learned it to pick up some hot chicks… ugh… cough, cough… well, to make someone fall in love with me, hence I spent quite an effort to learn cooking. There’s a sentence I kinda believe the most: a man can conquer his woman as long as he can seize her stomach.”</p><p>Pfft…</p><p>Hahaha…</p><p>Han Qingwu could not help giggling, but Tang Xiu burst into a roaring laughter. Who would have thought that the respected big playboy of Changxi City, the young master of the Ji Family, Ji Mu, turned out to have learned cooking just to flirt with girls?!</p><p>Four dishes and one soup, paired with meat and veggies.</p><p>Ji Mu did everything thoroughly, even serving fruits and dessert on the table. He seemed to be afraid that Tang Xiu and Han Qingwu would not enjoy the dishes he made, so he also prepared hot milk and bread on the side.</p><p>“Wow, it’s really delicious.” Han Qingwu was not a foodie, but she wolfed the meal down this time.</p><p>Tang Xiu tasted a few mouthfuls and praised, “It seems that your wife will be blessed in the future.”</p><p>“I’m glad you like it.” Ji Mu let out an embarrassed smile. “Ah, that’s right. What are you planning to do today?”</p><p>“Stroll with Han Qingwu and then return to Shanghai in the afternoon,” said Tang Xiu. “Also, Li Laoshan told me last night that he wants to return with me.”</p><p>Ji Mu looked at Han Qingwu, who was lowering her head to eat the dish, and smilingly said, “Since you’re going shopping with Miss Han, then I won’t be the third wheel, Brother Tang. Anyways, if you’re going to spend a couple more days in Changxi, do call me. I don’t have a plan to stay longer here, so I can’t send you off by then. But I’ll be visiting you again in Shanghai later if I have time.”</p><p>“By the way, don’t be over polite toward me later.” Tang Xiu waved his hand. “We’re going to have a drink together if there’s time.”</p><p>“Alright!” A joyful feeling blossomed inside Ji Mu’s heart after hearing it. He felt that what he had done yesterday was really worth it.</p><p>Yandang Ancient Town.</p><p>Tang Xiu accompanied Han Qingwu for most of the morning until noon. The duo then picked a restaurant and waited for Yu Hong to catch up. After swallowing her complaints, they then had lunch together. Originally, Yu Hong proposed to go boating in the afternoon together, but Tang Xiu received a call and gave up on the plan.</p><p>“Are you sure?” While holding the phone, Tang Xiu asked with eyes lit up.</p><p>Mouse’s voice came from the phone, “I’m absolutely sure, Boss. I spent quite a lot of money to buy the information from a senior executive of the Brain Assembly Biotech. Do you wanna know how much I spent? 6 million! That greedy bastard actually demanded 6 million yuan!!!”</p><p>“Let alone 6 million, even 60 million is still worth the news,” said Tang Xiu in a deep voice. “Anyways, I’ll immediately send someone to contact you. You’ll be in charge for directing them to keep an eye on Xie Zhiqiang for me. Call me at once when he makes contact with those SOE people.”</p><p>“Are you not going to come personally, Boss?” Asked Mouse. “This is a huge deal!”</p><p>“I’m in Changxi right now, and it will take one hour to get back,” said Tang Xiu. “Just tell me the address and I’ll find you when I get there.”</p><p>“Got it…”</p><p>After hanging up, Tang Xiu looked at the enthusiastic Han Qingwu and said, “There’s an urgent matter that I need to hurry back to Shanghai to. I’m afraid I can’t accompany you boating. Han Qingwu, are you going to go back with me or will you go back later?”</p><p>“Since you’re going back, then I’ll go with you,” said Han Qingwu without thinking.</p><p>“What is this important matter that you have to rush back so urgently to, Tang Xiu?” Asked Yu Hong with a dissatisfied expression. “It’s not easy for Qingwu to visit Changxi, and even I asked for a leave for this occasion. Why don’t you accompany her to have some fun here? Qingwu, Tang Xiu may have things to tend to, so just let him rush back first, do you think that I can’t accompany you?”</p><p>“About this…” Han Qingwu looked a bit hesitating.</p><p>“That’s right. What Yu Hong said is true, you should stay here and have some fun! Loosening and relaxing your mood so you can do your activities better later,” said Tang Xiu.</p><p>Han Qingwu still hesitated, before she eventually agreed. After all, her good sister had specially asked for a leave just to accompany her. She would hurt her if she were to leave!</p><p>At 16:00.</p><p>Tang Xiu, Li Laoshan, and Chu Xuecheng had already arrived at Shanghai. On the way there, Tang Xiu inquired clearly the purpose of the two for visiting Shanghai. It was to discuss some business deals, and Tang Xiu agreed to gather with them two days later before rushing to the address Mouse gave him.</p><p>Jingning District, Kangsha Pharmaceuticals.</p><p>The place had a good environment and strategic location and boasted a large area. Tang Xiu learned from the intel that this small company was a subsidiary of the Brain Assembly Biotech and was also where its pharmaceutical factory was located; Xie Zhiqiang had even bought the land as well.</p><p>“So, how was it? Is Xie Zhiqiang inside?”</p><p>After catching sight of Mouse, who was acting furtively like a thief, Tang Xiu asked the fella directly.</p><p>Mouse handed over a cigarette and personally lit it up for Tang Xiu, and then said, “He has been inside for more than four hours, and has yet to come out. Our men have been keeping an eye on the entire Kangsha Pharmaceuticals, so he’s definitely still inside. He has a secret lab there according to that sky-high price information I bought.”</p><p>“What about those SOE people? Is there any movement?” Asked Tang Xiu again.</p><p>“Yeah, a total of two groups have been here in these four hours. One of them is from that SOE company, consisting of four or five people. Their identities, however, are still a mystery. I’ve already assigned some men to investigate them, but there’s no result as of yet.”</p><p>Tang Xiu knitted his brows and said, “What you mean is, the other group is not from SOE?”</p><p>“They should not be,” said Mouse. “I’ve investigated all those from SOE who have sneaked into Shanghai, so I’m sure this group is not one of them. I think it’s highly likely this group is also after the genetic particles. Since I can buy a senior executive of the Brain Assembly Biotech, it is very likely that some other forces are keeping an eye on this company to investigate the existence of this genetic particle.”</p><p>“What you said makes sense.” Tang Xiu nodded. “Anyways, let’s not act rashly. We’ll first observe the reactions from the other forces. That’s right, did those SOE people and the other groups notice our men?”</p><p>“I guarantee you that what I’ve secretly arranged can never be found out,” said Mouse with a smile.</p><p>“Alright, keep an eye on this place, regardless of whether they are from the SOE, Xie Zhiqiang, or from other forces.” Tang Xiu nodded. “This gene particle is not your ordinary stuff, and regardless of which force obtains it, I’m afraid they will be able to train a huge number of masters in a very short time.  Not to mention that if this gene particle were to spread widely, it will definitely affect the power constellation around the world. I don’t want to see such a situation.”</p><p>Mouse understood Tang Xiu’s intention, as he also knew the power of this so-called gene particle. According to the boasting of the bought Brain Assembly Biotech’s senior executive, obtaining the gene particle was tantamount to getting a large number of armed forces, which was equal to having more control, power, and wealth.</p><p>“That’s right. We have yet to notice anyone from the military. They just… mysteriously disappeared.”</p><p>Tang Xiu stared blankly, before frowning and saying, “Is there a chance that one of the other groups who came here is from the military?”</p><p>“Unlikely.” Mouse shook his head.</p><p>“Then check it out. Investigate anyone who has the power to spy on the gene particle, including those from the military,” ordered Tang Xiu.</p><p>“Got it!” Mouse nodded.</p><p>Tang Xiu did not stay there. After hopping on the car, he looked at Mo Awu, who was sitting on the driver seat, and directly ordered, “Send some men to bring two sets of night suits. We’re going to move tonight.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
