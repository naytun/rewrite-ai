The leader of the group was the extremely cruel and merciless second in command – Zhenlei Duomu.</p><p>Zhenlei Duomu had a mysterious origin. Nobody knew what Zhenlei Duomu had experienced except for the boss of the Reston, who was hardly seen. Zhenlei Duomu wandered to Mexico and had led a vagrant life there when she was twelve. She had grown up in a drug syndicate, a paradise for culprits.</p><p>She was powerful.</p><p>Zhenlei Duomu was so powerful that even her name could frighten everyone in Reston. Some Mafias stronger than Reston dared not to provoke it due to its second in command – Zhenlei Duomu rather than its mysterious boss.</p><p>The Orient.</p><p>It was a place in her dream. However, for twenty years, she had never stepped into China. It was because she remembered the warning of the woman who supported her to twelve and taught her mysterious skills: Do not go to China as a killer.</p><p>However, she could not resist coming to the orient this time, and she believed Mist Source Island did not belong to China. On the one hand, she was instructed by her boss to come to Mist Source Island for plundering mineral resources and wealth, on the other hand, she hoped to find traces of that woman. Even if Zhenlei Duomu couldn’t meet her, it was enough to know she was still alive.</p><p>“Pengpeng…”</p><p>Someone knocked at her door, it was one of her most trusted subordinates, saying: “Boss, we have found some traces of a battle near the White Mist area south of the mountain. They are strange traces of a fighting with cold weapons instead of firearms.”</p><p>“BANG…”</p><p>In an instant, Zhenlei Duomu appeared at the door, and as the door was opened and closed momentarily, her confidant had been caught into the room.</p><p>“Scene caused by the cold weapon?”</p><p>Zhenlei Duomu asked indifferently.</p><p>The confidant was shocked and quivered in his heart, although he had already known that Zhenlei Duomu was very powerful and had the terrifying power far beyond common people, fright crippled him since he was caught into the room in an instant. Swallowing the horror, he forced himself to say, “Yes, very shocking battle signs, this scene is likely to be caused by some powerful ferocious beasts. But according to our judgment, it is not caused by ferocious beasts, so it can only prove it has been caused by humans. No, there are also other heterogeneous races.”</p><p>Zhenlei Duomu said in a low voice, “Let me know more.”</p><p>“After the investigation, we found traces of the legendary vampire, and… the scene caused by Talented Adept. Jin La has gone there and should return soon. She may be able to bring back a more comprehensive survey.” Said the subordinate.</p><p>At that moment, a cold light exploded from Zhenlei Duomu’s eyes. She had had fights with Bloodkin vampire, as well as Talented Adept. She knew that whether the Bloodkin or Talented Adept, both of them had terrifying power. Of course, she also had two Talented Adepts, one of which was Jin La.</p><p>“You go out first! After Jin La comes back, let her come to see me.”</p><p>“Yes, Madam!”</p><p>Night fell.</p><p>Grim-faced, Zhenlei Duomu stood beside the window on the second floor, looking at the northwest. It’s the direction of the battle signs, the white fog area on the south side of the mountain.</p><p>All of a sudden.</p><p>Her expression was slightly shocked, then she popped out of the window, and in a trice, she had appeared in the village a few hundred meters away. Looking at the figures who were fleeing for their lives in the distance, she kept flashing and showed up in front of them.</p><p>“What happened?”</p><p>Zhenlei Duomu looked at the four wounded subordinates, her eyes seemed to be able to spurt out a fire. But she still kept calm, asking in a deep voice.</p><p>“Boss, the enemy did this. Our ten-person squad was patrolling nearby and encountered a group of people. As a result… six companions were killed.” An injured middle-aged black person said.</p><p>Zhenlei Duomu’s expression changed slightly, and she asked, “Who are they?”</p><p>“The headed young man claimed to be the only son of Maio Hengfu, the richest man in Mist Source Island… Miao Wenlei. He’s very arrogant, and his men are very strong, they immediately shot us with a word of disagreement…” The black middle-aged man responded.</p><p>Zhenlei Duomu’s eyes got cold, she continued in a threatening manner, “The richest man in Mist Source Island? Humph… tell me in which direction they have gone, where should they be now?”</p><p>“They left toward the southwest. I don’t know where they are now, but we had a fight a few kilometers away only about ten minutes ago, they shouldn’t be far from there.”</p><p>“You go back.”</p><p>After giving the order, Zhenlei Duomu rushed to the southwest. Before her subordinates, she didn’t show her ghostly movements. But after getting unseen by the four subordinates, she immediately floated in the air, stepping on the branches and constantly rushing in midair.</p><p>In the southwest of the village, where the terrain was very high and got an excellent view, there was a towering old tree. Six bodies beside the tree looked terrible, and two of them were shot by numerous bullets.</p><p>“Bastard.”</p><p>Zhenlei Duomu’s eyelids twitched several times, then she stamped on the ground, the cracks on the earth suddenly spread like a spider web. She actually had a lot of subordinates, it was not a big deal if some of them died, but those she brought to Mist Source Island were almost her confidants who were not easy to cultivate.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
