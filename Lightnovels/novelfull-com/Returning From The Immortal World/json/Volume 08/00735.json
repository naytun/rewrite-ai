Just as they stepped inside and saw more than 20 young men and women all standing up and glaring at them with hostile faces.</p><p>“Eh? What happened?” Tang Xiu and Ouyang Lulu exchanged looks and were baffled by the reaction from everyone in the hall.</p><p>Upon seeing them, the people in the hall blanked for a moment, as Wei Guotao was a bit stunned when he saw Ouyang Lulu. His vision then fell on Tang Xiu and asked, “Who are you?”</p><p>Tang Xiu looked at everyone inside but could not find Chen Xiaowan at all. He was immediately confused and said, “Could it be that we came to the wrong hall? Sis Xiaowan clearly said her class reunion was being held in the Fragrance Hall, right? Where is she?”</p><p>“Are you looking for Chen Xiaowan?” Asked Wei Guotao, surprised.</p><p>“Yeah. I’m her younger brother.” Tang Xiu nodded. “I heard that you are all here for a class reunion, so I came with two bottles of wine.”</p><p>It was now everyone’s turn in the room to become baffled, exchanging dismayed looks. They thought that they were people who came to retaliate Lu Bo, thus they didn’t expect that he turned out to be Chen Xiaowan’s younger brother.</p><p>Wei Guotao himself had 99% assurance that it was true, so he immediately spoke, “Young Brother, Chen Xiaowan is currently out doing something and will come back later. How about you leave first and wait for her to come back? I’ll contact you again later.”</p><p>Asking guests to leave?!</p><p>As if realizing something, Tang Xiu turned his head and looked at the seven or eight men who had already walked inside, while the two in front were letting out curses. He then saw the people in the hall turn vigilant and suddenly could not help laughing, “Do you guys have a conflict with them?”</p><p>Wei Guotao, Lu Bo, and the others did not reply, but some of the more courageous men among them stepped forward to guard the six or seven females behind them.</p><p>“Wow, so many people here, eh?!”</p><p>The swollen-faced Bai Sheng entered the room unsteadily and then looked around. As he found Lu Bo among them, he immediately shouted angrily, “It’s that fucking bastard! I luckily followed you in secret before, so I knew you were in this hall, else you would have run away by now. The ones who dared to beat this Big Daddy are not born yet, but you just jumped out of your mother’s womb ahead of time. And today, I’ll kick you back to your mother’s womb.”</p><p>With that said, Bai Sheng wielded the bottle and seemed to be ready to storm Lu Bo.</p><p>“STOP!”</p><p>Tang Xiu furrowed his brows and shouted in a deep voice. At the same time, his feet instantly moved toward Bai Sheng. The latter had yet to smash the wine bottle, as he already caught his wrist and said, “This place is the Paradise Manor. You must know the consequences before you want to make a ruckus here.”</p><p>“Who the hell are you? It’s no damned fucking business with yours whether this Big Daddy wants to fuck things up here!”</p><p>BAM…</p><p>A loud, thumping sound was heard as Ouyang Lulu’s foot heavily kicked Bai Sheng’s chest. Despite being a man, Bai Sheng was not tall and his physique was also rather weak, hence he was sent back for several steps by Ouyang Lulu’s kick until he hit the two men behind him.</p><p>“You may curse me, but if you dare to curse him again I will snap your damn legs and tie you up at the entrance of my Paradise Manor like a dog. Do you believe me?” Shouted Ouyang Lulu angrily.</p><p>Getting kicked in the chest suffocated Bai Sheng. As he saw Ouyang Lulu’s appearance, never did he dream that such a beauty comparable to a celestial maiden was actually the one who kicked him, and was especially threatening him for another man.</p><p>“YOU…” Bai Shen was about to roar furiously but was pulled by a middle-aged man beside him.</p><p>The middle-aged man looked at Ouyang Lulu indifferently and said, “Listening to you, are you someone from this Paradise Manor?”</p><p>“Yes. I’m the owner of this place,” answered Ouyang Lulu coldly.</p><p>The owner?</p><p>The middle-aged man was struck dumb and suddenly realized something as his expression drastically changed and his attitude reversed 180 degrees. He then nodded and squeezed out an obsequious smile, “It turns out that you’re Miss Ouyang. Blame me for failing to recognize Mt. Tai when I met you. I heard from a friend of mine the other day that you have a good relationship with Mr. Tang, so I brought these friends from Fukang Province to join us. On the account of Mr. Tang’s face, why don’t you…”</p><p>Suddenly, his words came to an abrupt halt as it occurred to him that it was Tang Xiu who was accompanied by Ouyang Lulu. His expression froze as he gaped and was unable to voice anything else.</p><p>Tang Xiu sneered and said, “My face seems quite big, eh? To think that I can even make you bring people here to flatter me. So tell me, who’s this holy being friend you mentioned?”</p><p>The middle-aged man felt like he was falling into an ice cave, for he never imagined that the very person who was just cursed by his companion turned out to be Tang Xiu himself. Though it was his first time meeting Tang Xiu, his name was like a thunderclap piercing his ear.</p><p>“You… are you Mr. Tang Xiu?”</p><p>“I am!” Tang Xiu slightly nodded.</p><p>The middle-aged man squeezed out a smile and said with trembling lips, “My friend’s name is Jin Xingkui and he’s my client, and his recent project uses stones bought from me. Mr. Tang, my friend just lashed out his tantrum at you, please don’t stoop to his level and forgive him with your magnanimity.”</p><p>Tang Xiu looked at him with a strange expression, as he did not expect that this middle-aged man turned out to be Jin Xingkui’s business friend. He also had some shares in Jin Xingkui’s business, so it could be counted that he also had a business deal with this man!</p><p>Bai Sheng, who finally gasped for breath, wanted to lash out his anger again. After all, he was kicked under everyone’s watchful eyes, more so that the one who did it was such a dazzling belle—something very humiliating to him. But after hearing Tang Xiu being mentioned by his friend, he could not help but tremble, and his frenzied feelings also faded a lot.</p><p>“You… are you really Tang Xiu? From the Tang Family?” Bai Sheng’s attitude had drastically changed as well and asked with a cautious expression.</p><p>“You know me?” Tang Xiu frowned.</p><p>Bai Sheng’s heart thumped, nearly weeping. He never feared anyone and even practically ignored the elders of his family. But the fear he had toward that truly fierce and ruthless figure was genuine, and this figure was exactly Tang Xiu of the Tang Family from Beijing.</p><p>“Tang… Mr. Tang. I really apologize. I didn’t know the owner of this place is close to you. I really have dog eyes. I couldn’t recognize you at all just now. My name is Bai Sheng from Fukang Province’s Bai Family.”</p><p>Tang Xiu’s brows raised and asked, “Who is Bai Yang to you?”</p><p>“He’s the Bai Family’s Patriarch. I should call him Uncle according to the seniority,” said Bai Sheng.</p><p>“I know a bit about the Bai Family.” Tang Xiu nodded. “Whether it is Bai Yang or the rest of the family, they usually act low-key. I never thought this family had someone like you. Scram to Fukang Province fast, and you had better not to court calamity for your family when you’re outside later.”</p><p>Bai Sheng wiped off the cold sweat on his forehead, as he hurriedly nodded and said, “Yes, yes. I’ll definitely redeem myself according to your teaching. If… if you have no other instructions, then I’ll take my leave first. I’ll leave early in the morning and return to Fukang Province.”</p><p>With that said, all who came with threatening attitudes now quickly left with trepidation, while the more than 20 people in the Fragrance Hall were dumbfounded with dropping jaws—shocked by the series of events.</p><p>Tang Xiu then turned around to look at Wei Guotao and the others. A smile climbed up on his face as he said, “I apologize to all of you for having your dinner at our Paradise Manor disturbed. Hence, I’d like to present these two bottles of wine for everyone to taste. Also, we still have things to tend to, so we can’t accompany you.”</p><p>Gods Nectar?</p><p>At least a dozen people among them knew their wine, and also had seen the packaging of this top wine, the Gods Nectar.</p><p>Inwardly, they exclaimed in shock as the two bottles of wine given by Tang Xiu turned out to be Gods Nectar. It must be noted that this wine was very expensive and sold at 18,888 yuan in the exclusive stores. But in the ‘private market’ many were willing to obtain it for double the price.</p><p>It was an exquisite wine, yet it was very scarce in circulation.</p><p>That was the characteristic of the Gods Nectar.</p><p>“Mr. Tang, please stay.” Wei Guotao quickly called out. “We are really grateful for what just happened. I’m afraid we would be beaten if it wasn’t for you.”</p><p>“Nevermind it!” Tang Xiu smiled. “You chose to dine at Paradise Manor, so it’s our responsibility to guarantee your safety.”</p><p>Wei Guotao nodded in response with a smile. There was a hesitating look on his face as he pointed to the two bottles of Gods Nectar on the table and said, “I must decline your kindness with thanks, Mr. Tang. But this wine… is way… too precious. We…”</p><p>“No, it’s just a liquor, and nothing precious.” Tang Xiu waved his hand and smilingly said, “But you…”</p><p>“Oh? You’re here, Brother? And you too, Lulu!”</p><p>At the door of the Fragrance Hall, Chen Xiaowan came inside with empty hands. There was previously a bit of anger on her face, but it then instantly disappeared completely after seeing Tang Xiu and Ouyang Lulu.</p><p>Ouyang Lulu quickly greeted her and affectionately grabbed her arms and said, “I just learned that you and your classmates are having a reunion here, Sis Xiaowan. Else I would have instructed my staff to prepare the best hall for all of you.”</p><p>Chen Xiaowan looked a bit embarrassed and replied in a low voice, “No need to be this polite between us, Lulu. Besides, having to meet and gather here together is already great.”</p><p>“Just enjoy yourself here like it’s your home, Sis Xiaowan—wherever you feel great. Well, consider this dinner tonight my treat. Just enjoy your dishes and wine and have a good evening. All of your spending tonight is on me,” said Ouyang Lulu with a smile.</p><p>“Don’t…”</p><p>“Nope. It’s already decided. Else your brother will scold me to death later!” Ouyang Lulu interrupted her and smiled.</p><p>Tang Xiu could not help laughing and said, “Lulu wants to exempt you from spending, Sis, so just accept it. Anyways, we won’t bother your dinner. Just call me later after you’re done and I’ll escort you back.”</p><p>After a while, Tang Xiu and Ouyang Lulu left, leaving only a group of Chen Xiaowan’s classmates in the Fragrance Hall. Just as Chen Xiaowan threw back the car key to Wei Guotao, voices buzzed from her classmates:</p><p>“It was so amazing. Xiaowan’s younger brother is simply too powerful.”</p><p>“Yeah! Amazing. Those guys a while ago seemed to be scared out their wits and nearly wet their pants.”</p><p>“That’s a real nouveau riche for you!”</p><p>“Damn! Tang Xiu is really cool!”</p><p>“Yeah! He’s my idol!”</p><p>“If only I had such a younger brother, it’d be so damn great!”</p><p>“…”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
