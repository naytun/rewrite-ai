After he found that nobody was nearby, he said bitterly, “You should not have known. This Miao Hengfu has a patron behind his back, someone from the Mu Family of Beijing. This man surely will never let this matter go now that Miao Hengfu has been killed. This is just… aargh!”</p><p>Tang Xiu intentionally asked, “I have a relationship with someone from the Mu Family, might you tell me who that man is?”</p><p>“He’s Mu Jianhua,” whispered Yang Chuxiong.</p><p>“You mean… the backer behind Miao Hengfu is Mu Jianhua?” asked Tang Xiu, looking surprised.</p><p>“Yeah! Though Mu Jianhua is famous trash, good-for-nothing idiot, he still has the blood of the Mu Family after all. His father is the current head of the Mus, and it would be pretty troublesome if he got upset.”</p><p>An idiot?</p><p>Tang Xiu’s mouth twitched a bit and then said with a helpless expression, “I need to be frank with you, Division Commander Yang. That idiot you just mentioned is actually my future father-in-law.”</p><p>“Your… what?” Yang Chuxiong was utterly dumbfounded.</p><p>“Yeah. My girlfriend is Mu Wanying and Mu Jianhua is her father so that idiot you told me about is my future father-in-law,” confirmed Tang Xiu.</p><p><em>Cough! Cough…</em></p><p>Yang Chuxiong coughed twice, looking awkward and embarrassed. He suddenly wished the floor could have a hole he could burrow himself into. Though he did feel that Mu Jianhua was a disgrace, he had some admiration for Tang Xiu, while he just actually cursed his father-in-law right before him…. this… was really shameful.</p><p>“Alright, you didn’t know, so I don’t blame you, Division Commander Yang. You don’t have to worry about that.” Tang Xiu just let out a smile and said, “Besides, Mu Jianhua is himself, whereas my girlfriend is who she is. Well, let’s cut this topic off, then. Since the one behind the Qingyuan Group can be said as someone close to me, then I’ll help clean up this mess!”</p><p>Yang Chuxiong let out a dry, hollow chuckle before he quickly said, “What exactly do you want to do, Mr. Tang? The Qingyuan Group does have some businesses on the surface, but they also have some dirty ones in the back. If it wasn’t for… err… the Mu Family’s support behind them, we could have taken down Miao Hengfu’s operation already.”</p><p>Tang Xiu perfectly understood Yang Chuxiong’s meaning and slightly smiled. Then he nodded and said, “I understand. You can rest assured about that, Division Commander Yang. The future Qingyuan Group will not have anything to do with any unclean business anymore. Anyways, I still have to tend to something, so I’ll take my leave.”</p><p>****</p><p>Qingyuan Group.</p><p>When Tang Xiu came to the company with Jin Shi and Xue Shan, he was stopped by several security guards before he entered the front door of the company, even then the security guards were very rude.</p><p>“This is my ID.”</p><p>Tang Xiu took out the green book and watched as the security guards had their complexions drastically changing and having their attitudes turn 180 degrees toward him. He then immediately hummed coldly and said, “You are not to speak anything about my identity. Back to your job!”</p><p>With that said, he waltzed inside. After passing through the building’s front entrance, Tang Xiu found two young female receptionists fiddling with their mobile phones at the lobby, while several young men and women were gathered having a chat.</p><p>“It’s odd. No one here has any device that produces static electricity,” Jin Shi, who was walking alongside Tang Xiu, couldn’t help but comment.</p><p>Tang Xiu also frowned. He then toward the lobby and said, “I’m someone from the government. I’ll have to trouble you to inform call the senior executives of the Qingyuan Group here in half an hour tops!”</p><p>The two lady receptionists observed Tang Xiu and his men for some time before one of them immediately shook her head and said with a beautiful smile, “Please don’t pull a prank on us, Sir. We would have already received the news should there be any inspection from the government. Also, our Boss is not here currently. You might have to wait for some time for him to come back.”</p><p>Tang Xiu then spoke in a heavy tone, “Contact all the senior executives of your Qingyuan Group to gather in the meeting room here, except for your Boss, of course. This is my ID. Obstruct my work and you shall be prosecuted as acting against the law!”</p><p>“This…” The two female receptionists looked at the green book, but neither of them knew what it meant. After some hesitation, the woman said, “We have no authority to do that, Sir. How about calling Vice Li, the Vice President of the Qingyuan Group? Would you like to speak to him first?”</p><p>“Fine!” Tang Xiu nodded.</p><p>A few minutes later, a middle-aged man in his 40s came to the lobby along with two young men. After he observed Tang Xiu trio for some time, he said, “Hello, I’m Li Heming, the Vice President of the Qingyuan Group. And you are…”</p><p>After showing his proof of authority, Tang Xiu spoke in a deep tone, “Given your position as the Vice President of the company, you should know what it means being represented by this document. Now, I command you to contact all senior executives of the Qingyuan Group at once to convene in the meeting room. As for your Boss, I won’t wait for him.”</p><p>Li Heming looked a bit pale. He had never seen this green book before but he had heard what it represented by the words written on its cover. He quickly nodded and walked to the side. The first one he called was his Big Boss, Miao Hengfu, but much to his headache, the Big Boss did not even answer him at all.</p><p>On the third floor, in the meeting room.</p><p>In just half an hour, nearly all the related people had arrived other than Miao Hengfu, the owner of the Qingyuan Group. More than 20 people were now sitting on both sides of the conference table, each wearing an indifferent look as they saw the person who sat on the chair that was usually reserved for the Big Boss and whispering to each other.</p><p>“Have all of them arrived, Li Heming?” The time had come, and Tang Xiu immediately asked.</p><p>“All have arrived,” replied Li Heming.</p><p>Tang Xiu gave a slight nod in response. His sharp eyes swept the faces of more than 20 people here and then said in a deep and heavy voice, “I’m going to announce something. Your Boss, the owner of the Qingyuan Group, Miao Hengfu, has died along with his son, Miao Wenlei, while dozens of your security guards have been killed after a clash with some foreign forces. I already investigated Miao Hengfu’s relatives; he has no one else but his son and his old parents. It’s obvious that his parents are no longer suitable to manage the Qingyuan Group’s business, so now all of you are facing two options. The first one is for you to leave the company and seek another career elsewhere. Also, you had better find some stock broker to trade Miao Hengfu’s shares into cash to be inherited by his parents.”</p><p>Li Heming was dumbfounded, and so were the rest of more than 20 senior executives of the Qingyuan Group. Tongue-tied and dumbfounded, they looked at Tang Xiu with disbelief in their faces.</p><p><em>The Big Boss… died?</em></p><p>The news was as though a blasting thunderclap in their ears, leaving them at a loss for some time.</p><p>Only after a long while did Li Heming finally spoke with shivering lips and low voice, “Mr. Tang, our Boss owned the entire Qingyuan Group. 100% of the shares belonged to him.”</p><p>Tang Xiu had already assigned someone to investigate this matter before he came to the Qingyuan Group, so he naturally knew about the situation. While observing everyone’s shocked faces, he said, “Since Miao Hengfu has died and his parents are not suitable to manage the Qingyuan Group, then I will decide this matter. I’ll give a sum of money to Miao Hengfu’s parents and resettle them back under the country care, letting them enjoy their remaining happy years.</p><p>“As for the Qingyuan Group, the country will take a part of the shares, which would be 51%, while senior executives, yourselves, will receive 1% each except for Li Heming. The remaining 25% will then be left to investors.”</p><p>After that, Tang Xiu asked in a deep voice, “Is there any opinions?”</p><p>Li Heming’s pupils contracted and a glint flashed in his eyes. How could he not see that Tang Xiu was using his position as a representative of the country to take over Miao Hengfu’s business? Upon seeing the excitement of the other senior executives of the company who got 1% of the shares, Li Heming nervously looked at Tang Xiu and said, “Mr. Tang, what about me…”</p><p>“All of them amount to 22 people, hence 22% of the shares in total, while you will get 3%. But you will be working as the General Manager of the Qingyuan Group henceforth. As for your annual salary, it will still be the same,” Tang Xiu elaborated.</p><p>3%? Nearly 100 million yuan?</p><p>Li Heming felt happy inwardly and nodded, “I’m fine with it.”</p><p>Tang Xiu nodded in satisfaction. Then he took out a communicator and dialed Mu Waning’s number in front of everyone, and then turned the speaker on.</p><p>“Hello, Tang Xiu!”</p><p>Mu Wanying’s voice came from the communicator, and everyone in the meeting room could clearly hear her voice.</p><p>“Wanying, how much money can you get from your company now? I mean, how much liquid funds you can take without affecting the normal operations of your company?” asked Tang Xiu.</p><p>Mu Wanying hesitated for a moment and then answered, “The clients you introduced to me last time have made the company expand by more than 10 times, and with considerable income as well. I just checked out the financial situation a couple of days ago, and I think it won’t be a problem to take up to 250 million yuan.”</p><p>“250 million it is, then,” said Tang Xiu. “Anyways, I’m going to offer you another business. You should know about the Qingyuan Group in Mist Source Island, right? Your father, Mu Jianhua, is deeply related to Miao Hengfu, the owner of the Qingyuan Group. Now that he died with his son, you will spend 250 million yuan to buy 25% of the company shares.”</p><p>“What did you say? Miao Hengfu is dead?” Mu Wanying asked.</p><p>“That’s right. He has died. And now I’m here acting on behalf of the government to solve some issues here,” said Tang Xiu.</p><p>“Then, about my Dad…” said Mu Wanying quickly.</p><p>“I won’t deal with your father,” Tang Xiu interrupted her. “The one who can manage him is you. You have to come to Mist Source Island personally later! The Vice President of the Qingyuan Group, Li Heming, as well as the officials on Mist Source Island, will fully cooperate with you to carry out the equity changes.”</p><p>“About this… Okay!”</p><p>Tang Xiu hung up and looked at the shocked faces of the top executives of the Qingyuan Group. Then, he spoke, “I believe I don’t need to tell you anything as you should know who Mu Wanying is. Miao Hengfu is dead, but not the Qingyuan Group itself. I hope you keep this issue confidential before the equity changes and the transfer have been finished. Even after those are over, you should still keep my warning in your mind. Else, I will take back what I’ve given you and even make you pay more.”</p><p>“We understand!”</p><p>The top executives of the company had a change in expression and successively solemnly nodded.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
