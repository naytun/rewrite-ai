But this time, Tang Xiu had temporality refined ten Invisible Talismans and the group did not encounter any obstacles and arrived at the innermost gate sentry.</p><p>Bam, bam, bam…</p><p>Jin Shi and the others instantly stunned the six security guards who were vigilantly standing guard outside the gate.</p><p>Tang Xiu unleashed the Bloodguzzler Dagger and imbued his Primal Chaos Force to slash the iron gate. The entire thick iron gate was cut as easily as cutting a tofu, as eleven men then dashed through the interior of the building, greeted by flashing red lights and sirens.</p><p>“Awu, take some men to clean up the mixed fishes. Remember, try not to kill if you can. Just stun them,” ordered Tang Xiu.</p><p>“Roger!” Mo Awu complied and led four experts upstairs to the following floors.</p><p>Tang Xiu stood before the elevator and coldly stared at its entrance. He predicted that some people would rush out given the situation outside and the buzzing alarm. As expected, the elevator’s entrance suddenly opened half a minute later, as six men in black full body armor wielding nearly two-meter long blades rushed out from the inside.</p><p>“ON GUARD.”</p><p>A fierce and swift aura exuded from all the pores of the first man’s body to rush out of the elevator door, as he dazed for a moment after dashing out. The sensor inside showed that there were many intruders outside the elevator door, how could there be nobody now? As the prized hatchet man under Xie Zhiqiang, however, he still maintained his vigilance at its highest.</p><p>Tang Xiu was standing in front of him while folding his arms and watching the man’s vigilant look. His fist then heavily hammered the man’s forehead. Even though he wore a hard helmet, the huge force smashed the helmet and slammed onto his temple.</p><p>Bang…</p><p>The man in armor crashed to the floor, and yet the gigantic force was unable to kill him. At the moment when Jin Shi and the rest instantly stormed over the other five armored men, the man who was knocked down by Tang Xiu shook his head and propped himself up with difficulty, trying to get up.</p><p>“Oh? This is a bit interesting.”</p><p>Tang Xiu stepped on the back of the man in armor and forced him back to lie on the floor, and sneered, “Quite a powerful strength and unexpectedly able to withstand my heavy punch. This full body armor does have good protection, the only pity is that it’s kind of out of place to be worn by you.”</p><p>In just a few seconds, the other five armored men were also knocked down by Jin Shi and the rest. Taking advantage of the situation, Jin Shi approached and kicked the armored man under Tang Xiu’s foot, asking, “This elevator should lead to the underground. Shall we get down, Boss?”</p><p>“We’ll go down.” Tang Xiu strode into the elevator quickly followed by the others. The elevator descended, and the door directly opened ten seconds after. As more than a dozen men in full body armor outside the elevator saw Tang Xiu and his men, some of them at the front directly stormed over.</p><p>Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh…</p><p>Several flying swords were unleashed. Along with the flashing sword lights, the hard armor was easily cut as four or five armored men were killed in an instant.</p><p>The underground space was very large. Other than two large halls, there were still more than a dozen spacious rooms. In the innermost monitoring room, Xie Zhiqiang and Austin Cole had reached an agreement. The latter had even contacted the HQ in Europe and ordered the Financial Director of the SOE company to transfer 1 billion USD to Xie Zhiqiang’s Swiss Bank account.</p><p>At present, however, Austin Cole had a very nasty expression. He was known for his fierceness and cruelty. Fury and anger surged inside his whole being as his fierce and ruthless eyes stared at the surveillance monitor that displayed the scene where the men in armor were constantly being killed.</p><p>“Xie Zhiqiang, those armored warriors of yours have yet to go through genetic modification, yet they are already very formidable, right? Why can the enemy still easily kill them? You can see for yourself that they are not using any guns at all. They are only using… swords?! That’s right, those are ancient swords used by those barbarians!” Austin Cole turned around and roared furiously.</p><p>Xie Zhiqiang’s complexion was ghastly pale as a light flashed in his eyes as he got lost in thought. He did not know the origins of these people, but there was something he was very clear about that: his impregnable underground base could not stop their advance whatsoever with their power.</p><p>There was only one way out for him at present. Running away!</p><p>He must escape with the gene particles and his four best Genetic Warriors!</p><p>“A Ming, A Liang. Send someone to secure the core research data and the other data at once and rush to the third exit as fast as possible. Start the self-destruct system and set the countdown to three minutes. The enemies are very strong. We don’t need to be entangled in combat with them here, thus we’ll just evacuate first. I’ll find ways to figure out their identities later.” Xie Zhiqiang suddenly got up and walked outside while sending his orders with a solemn expression.</p><p>Anger all over his face, Austin Cole dashed to block the door, took out his gun, aimed it at Xie Zhiqiang’s head and shouted, “I’m seriously suspecting you now, Xie Zhiqiang. Black eats black and dog eats dog, eh? We have already bought the gene particles and its research data. But you obviously have backups!!”</p><p>“Watch your words and actions, Mr. Cole.” Xie Zhiqiang frowned and coldly said, “If I really wanted to do so, I’d have already ordered my men to kill you right after the SOE company paid me instead of waiting until now. Those who got butchered outside are my men! The masters I have groomed using the gene particles! Other than the gene particles used on them, there are still those armors tailored especially for them. Do you know how much I had to spend on one set of full body armor? FOUR MILLION USD! That’s how much each its worth. Now tell me, how much I lost just to meet you, huh?”</p><p>Austin Cole wavered, as he also could tell that there was no need for Xie Zhiqiang to create such a plot. After all, these Genetic Warriors were very formidable and they were Xie Zhiqiang’s men whose loyalty was unquestionable. It was better to order them to kill themselves rather than using their lives to play an act.</p><p>After thinking it through, he put his gun away. Just as he turned to look at the monitor screen, Xie Zhiqiang instantly moved and directly stabbed his neck from the side with a dagger. With a face full of killing intent, he then shouted, “Kill all those from the SOE company!!!”</p><p>Bang, bang, bang…</p><p>Gunshots were sounded, but the bullets hit no one. The ones who opened fire were Austin Cole’s men, but two seconds after they opened fire, all of them had already been hit by sharp daggers and blades. A Ming and A Qing swiftly killed eight or nine of Austin’s men and picked up the two suitcases in their hands.</p><p>Xie Zhiqiang squatted and patted Austin Cole, whose neck was twitching, and sneered at him, “I would not have the need to kill you had no enemies intruded into my base. But you already suspected me for scheming, thus it would be a shame and unfair to you if I were not to realize that idea of yours. Don’t worry, though. I can shift the blame of your death on the intruders so they can bear the unlucky black pot for me.”</p><p>“WARNING TO BOSS! WARNING TO BOSS! The self-destruct system has been turned on. The site will explode within three minutes.” A low voice suddenly broadcasted from the walkie-talkie on A Ming’s shoulder.</p><p>Xie Zhiqiang immediately got up and kicked Austin Cole, sending him to his death directly. Then, he ordered in a deep voice, “Notify the rest to immediately retreat to the third exit. Tell the others at the outside to prepare the cars, we’ll leave as fast as possible.”</p><p>Outside the underground elevator.</p><p>Tang Xiu, Jin Shi, and the others did not show mercy this time and completely steamrolled more than a dozen armored men in just 20 seconds. As dozens of men in black suits and heavy firearms came out from the inside corridor, Jin Shi and the rest quickly dispersed to find a cover while delivering lethal strikes.</p><p>“Frost Needles!”</p><p>Tang Xiu did not run as he condensed ice needles out of thin air. Each black suited man who appeared was then hit by an ice needle on their vital points. While rapidly advancing forward, dozens of men in black suits were killed.</p><p>Suddenly, two bald and burly men appeared in the corridor ahead as the two sides then clashed fiercely. The two bald men sprinted toward Jin Shi’s group at the front while holding a sharp dagger.</p><p>“HACK ‘EM!”</p><p>Jin Shi and the others scornfully sneered as they controlled their flying swords to sweep the two, but the two burly men avoided the strikes that were originally a sure hit and kill strike with an instant movement.</p><p>“INTRUDERS… YOU’RE DEAD!!!”</p><p>One of the bald men with a scar on his face hideously grinned as he swept his dagger toward Jin Shi’s face. Just at this moment, it was a few centimeters away from Jin Shi’s face, however, two ice needles instantly pierced his eyes.</p><p>AAARGH…</p><p>A shrill scream came out from the bald man’s mouth as he retracted back his swift and fierce strike instantly. A flying sword flying behind him then hacked his waist the moment he subconsciously tried to evade.</p><p>Tang Xiu’s expression was cold as he shouted in a deep voice, “Focus and unleash everything you have in combat!!!”</p><p>Jin Shi and the others looked ashamed and immediately threw away the thought of underestimating the enemy from their mind, manipulating the flying swords to form a sword array to launch a strike to kill the other bald man.</p><p>Two minutes later, Tang Xiu, Jin Shi, and the others had already rushed to the third exit. Tang Xiu had already guessed that Xie Zhiqiang was responsible for the death of Austin Cole and his men, but he did not pity them at all. After seeing the tightly shut third exit door, Tang Xiu only sneered and released his Bloodguzzler Dagger again to slash the entire dor.</p><p>In a factory inside Kangsha Pharmaceuticals, Xie Zhiqiang had already come out with more than a dozen of his men. A scornful sneer painted his face as he walked outside the factory, and then asked in a deep voice, “Have A Feng and Qiangzi come out yet?”</p><p>“Perhaps they won’t come out.” A Ming shook his head.</p><p>A thick killing intent suffused Xie Zhiqiang’s eyes, as he imposingly said, “The underground base will explode in less than a minute. Since they won’t come out, then the enemies shall be buried along with them! Have you brought along all the data and gene particles?”</p><p>“I’ve brought everything.” A Ming nodded.</p><p>Screech, screech, screech, screech…</p><p>Six SUVs quickly stopped outside the factory with only the driver in each car. They were the people Xie Zhiqiang had long arranged to aid and fetch them up at the third exit once the underground base was compromised, so they could evacuate him as fast as possible.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
