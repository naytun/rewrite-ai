Tang Xiu’s invitation made him very flattered. He secretly thought that Tang Xiu concealed himself very deeply and had a good character at the same time.</p><p>“Ji Mu?”</p><p>After more than half an hour, Qin Shaoyang arrived and looked surprised when he saw that the person who was dining with Tang Xiu turned out to be Ji Mu.</p><p>Ji Mu was similarly stunned since he did not expect that the friend Tang Xiu mentioned turned out to be Qin Shaoyang, someone who he had sworn brothers with. Shoving back the chair and getting up, Ji Mu said with a smile, “Brother Tang just told me he was waiting for a friend to come, but I never thought it would be you, Second Brother!”</p><p>“I did not expect that the person Brother Tang was having a drink with was you either, Ji Mu,” said Qin Shaoyang with a smile. “Why are you here?”</p><p>“I’m the one who is paying a visit to Brother Tang.”</p><p>After listening to the conversation between the two men, Tang Xiu waved to Qin Shaoyang, hinting for him to take a seat, and then asked, “You two already know each other?”</p><p>“Ji Mu and I are sworn brothers, Brother Tang,” said Qin Shaoyang with a smile. “He kind of liked to stroll around everywhere when he was young, having a strong camaraderie and also liked stick to the brotherhood code. I happened to bump into Ji Mu back when I had a fight with some people, and then we gradually got along well from then on. We then found that we were the same kind of people and got along well, so…”</p><p>Tang Xiu immediately understood and said with a smile, “Well, that saves me from introducing the two of you. Anyways, what are you doing in Shanghai, Shaoyang? Is there something up?”</p><p>Qin Shaoyang glanced at Ji Mu, and then finally answered without try to avoid him, “There are two things. Firstly, our company has been set up and the HQ will be in Beijing, and we’ll start the business on May 1st. Can you come over and attend it? We invested quite a lot to hire a CEO for the company, Zhu Changtian, and he wishes to meet you and Chu Yi.”</p><p>“I’ll go if I can take a vacation during the May holiday,” said Tang Xiu. “Tell me the second reason.”</p><p>“The big star Zhang Xinya is currently in Shanghai, and I heard from a friend of mine that you have a good relationship with her. Can you ask her to go to our company, by chance?” Asked Qin Shaoyang. “You know, the contract between her and her previous agency is over, so she’s free now.”</p><p>“Business is business, and friendship is friendship. I understand this principle, and certainly, it’s possible to use friendship to discuss business as well,” said Tang Xiu. “If that is the case, I’ll phone Zhang Xinya later to ask whether she is interested to join our company. But I’ll respect her choice regardless of which decision she makes, though.”</p><p>Looking happy, Qin Shaoyang then looked around first before he spoke in a low voice, “I heard that she’s kind of broke recently, Tang Xiu. As long as we give her a high price and a well-paid contract, I think she would hardly reject it. If anything, just tell her directly that we’ll give her an advance payment bond worth 5 million yuan.”</p><p>“Eh, she’s broke?” Asked Tang Xiu, surprised.</p><p>“Yeah!” Qin Shaoyang nodded. “It’s a rumor that’s been widely spread in many circles, that she has invested in some business. It’s kind of related to some property construction business or something, and she has yet to earn any return at all. And now, tons of people in the entertainment industry are waiting to watch the good show.”</p><p>Tang Xiu could not help laughing and said, “I get it. But I’m afraid those who want to see Zhang Xinya become a laughingstock will eventually look at her with envy, though. She will not lose her money, and instead, will definitely make a fortune in the future.”</p><p>“Why do you say that?” Asked Qin Shaoyang, confused.</p><p>Tang Xiu did not conceal it, “It’s because that real estate business she invested, was with me. Have you heard of the Shanghai’s Jinda Estate belonging to Jin Xingkui? The new real estate project he is about to develop in the future was designed by me, while Zhang Xinya and I have shares in it.”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>Qin Shaoyang was taken aback, and even Ji Mu was stunned. Little did they think that Zhang Xinya would have such a deep relationship with Tang Xiu, much less being partners in business.</p><p>Zhang Xinya is doomed to make a fortune. Definitely!</p><p>Qin Shaoyang and Ji Mu exchanged looks, and both of them thought the same, as though having a prior agreement. After all, for one to be able to cling to such a big tree like Tang Xiu, it would be easy for that person to make a fortune.</p><p>About 10 PM, Tang Xiu phoned Han Qingwu to ask for a one-day leave, and then called Zhang Xinya. Having learned that she was really in Shanghai, they then made an appointment to meet tomorrow.</p><p>That night, Tang Xiu spent the time accompanying Lulu and had some rounds of sex. Despite having her body improved a lot, Lulu was still left tired and breathless, before she eventually slept in Tang Xiu’s embrace.</p><p>The next day, Tang Xiu left the Paradise Manor and headed to the place of the appointment he made with Zhang Xinya. What made him somewhat helpless was that this beauty parlor only accepted women, and did not allow gays or straight males to enter. Fortunately, Zhang Xinya had a good relationship with the owner, so a staff brought Tang Xiu from the back door and went directly to office area on the fourth floor.</p><p>Is this a woman country or something?</p><p>What surprised Tang Xiu was that this beauty parlor had at least a hundred employees, and without exception, each and every one of them was a young belle. Despite having good self-control and a firm mind, Tang Xiu still felt awkward and embarrassed upon facing them, since nearly all of them wore a half-exposed gown while coming and going in the corridors.</p><p>“Wow, what a rare sight to see a man here! Who could have such a big face to make our Boss open the back door, eh? Could it be that the Boss is in love?”</p><p>“100 yuan bet! He’s definitely not the Boss’ man. She wouldn’t be willing to let her boyfriend come to us here given her disposition, no?”</p><p>“Yup, that’s right. Boss would definitely hide her boyfriend from us if she was in love. Saving herself from the trouble of him getting bewitched and taken away by this pack of vixens.”</p><p>“Hahaha. We sisters are all serving the ladies here. Who wants to make an exception and gang up this handsome fella?”</p><p>“Well, if I could go for it, we’d be free at 2 PM…”</p><p>“SHAMELESS!”</p><p>“YOU’RE A FOX…”</p><p>“HAHAHA…”</p><p>Tang Xiu could not help but secretly shake his head upon hearing the comments and teasing from this group of women. It was said that three women were enough to make a place noisy like a drama, and yet now there were more than a hundred of them here. This was simply like dozens of big movies being played at the same time, and the scene was comparable to that of a grocery market. Thoroughly a blast!</p><p>He subconsciously sped up his pace and followed the woman who brought him in, quickly crossed the office area, and then entered the innermost General Manager Office. By the window inside, a woman donned in a brown waistcoat, white blouse, white trousers, and short haircut, was waiting while watching the scene outside and looking at him from the sideline. She had a good figure with her hands stuffed into her trousers’ pocket, showing off a very elegant and charming posture.</p><p>“Boss, I brought Mr. Tang here.”</p><p>“Okay. You may exit!”</p><p>The woman’s voice was neutral, and she did not even turn her head.</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>The woman left and closed the door.</p><p>Tang Xiu wore a tranquil expression. Though he did not know whether Zhang Xinya was here or not, he also did not believe that this place was dangerous like of a dragon’s pond or a tiger’s cave, so he was not afraid to be engaged in some scheme. Seeing that the woman had yet to turn around, Tang Xiu went straight to the sofa at the side and sat, tilting his leg and asking, “Do you mind if I smoke?”</p><p>The woman finally slowly turned around. Her beauty was suffocating, but the neutral dress she wore gave off a different kind of beauty. She looked colorfully beautiful and yet not bewitching, seemingly cold and yet not chilly. She was like a Green Lotus in the shallow pool of winter.</p><p>“You…”</p><p>Tang Xiu, who was just about to pull out a cigarette, froze, and an unusual light flashed in his eyes. Her face was nearly identical to Zhang Xinya’s, but he could tell that she was definitely not Zhang Xinya. Two people might have an identical face, but it was impossible to perfectly imitate their temperaments.</p><p>“What’s wrong? It’s only been a short time since we last met and you don’t recognize me anymore?” A smile outlined on the corner of the woman’s mouth. It was a smile with a bit of teasing.</p><p>Tang Xiu shook his head and continued pulling his cigarette, lit it up and took a puff before speaking, “You may look identical to Zhang Xinya, but you’re definitely not her. And I… I’ve never seen nor met you before. If my guess is correct, you should be Zhang Xinya’s twin sister, though I can’t tell whether you are the younger or the older one.”</p><p>“Oh?” The woman now gazed at Tang Xiu deeply. His answer surprised her very much. Her name was Zhang Xinyue, Zhang Xinya’s twin younger sister. Nobody had been able to really identify the siblings before since they were small, especially those who first saw them. And yet, this was the first time someone was firmly sure that she was not her sister, Zhang Xinya.</p><p>“Care to explain to me the reason why you said that?” Zhang Xinyue folded her arms after turning her back toward the window and looked at Tang Xiu.</p><p>“It’s very simple. You have a different temperament,” said Tang Xiu. “What I’m looking at is not your outside appearance, because one can dress up to look pretty and coquettish, but also dress up to look neutral. I said that you’re not her because the temperament you give off is what’s inside your bones, while there are also some nuances and subtle differences in your speech and gestures. Zhang Xinya has a gentle personality, and she gives off a feeling like bathing in the spring breeze, and you are different. Though this is our first meeting, the feeling you give off is like a cold colorful beauty, and yet not a chilling and bewitching one. Just like a quiet Green Lotus temperament.”</p><p>Clap clap clap…</p><p>Zhang Xinyue applauded and praised, “I finally get why my sister often mentions you in front of me. You’re handsome, with exquisite mind and extraordinary intelligence. Of course, this may also be the very reason why you can set up the Magnificent Tang Corporation which now became the hottest startup company with huge potential in the business world.”</p><p>“I’m nothing but an ordinary man and a very ordinary college student.” Tang Xiu shook his head and said with a smile. “Children of the poor are usually able to manage their households earlier, so they can think and do a bit more than what others think.”</p><p>Facing Tang Xiu’s modesty, Zhang Xinyue felt a bit uncomfortable. She thought that Tang Xiu should be a young man who had pride carved deep in his bones. For instance, a while ago. He straightly sat on the sofa comfortably and lit up a cigarette when she had yet to give consent. And yet, the modesty he showed was as though coming from his heart and not just a pretense.</p><p>It was very contradictory, the likes of which the fusion of two personalities just like one could see from the fusion of the Good and Evil in the olden times of the Martial World. Nonetheless, it also formed a unique aura of righteousness and evil at the same time.</p><p>“He’s the kind of man that cannot be seen through.”</p><p>Zhang Xinyue muttered to herself inwardly. She then came to Tang Xiu’s front, took a seat and asked, “My sister is currently having her makeup done, Mr. Tang. So you may have to wait for some time. While accompanying you, may I ask you a question?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
