Contact the police and ask them to use the communication equipment to locate Wenlei’s personal phone. In addition, send people out at once to look for him. Remember, you must find him as fast as you can, regardless of what methods you will take and what price you will pay.”</p><p>“Well…”</p><p>That senior official hesitated for a while and said with a wry smile, “Boss, considering the unusual circumstances at present that all of us are infected, I’m afraid it is unrealistic to send a large number of people to look for him. I suggest we get all members of our security team well prepared, and once the police locate Childe Miao’s personal phone, we will send them there immediately.”</p><p>Miao Hengfu abruptly realized it was a special period when everyone on Mist Source Island was infected by the Darkening Virus. Even if they knew how to suppress the virus for the time being, their method could not treat the root cause. Everyone on Mist Source Island lived in panic, so it was indeed unrealistic to send people out to look for his son on a large scale.</p><p>“Do as what you just said. But send someone to the security team first to ask for more information, for example, who has left with Wenlei and if someone knows where they have gone.”</p><p>“I’ll do it right away.”</p><p>“Original translation from Www。WangmamaRead。Com。”</p><p>After the two senior officials left, Miao Hengfu walked back and forth in his office with a gloomy face. He was convinced his security guards must seek for help for some reasons, since they were the members of the Flame squad, who had done something shameful with him, and they were also the key hatchet men to be cultivated.</p><p>Sure enough.</p><p>Soon the results of the investigation had been sent to Miao Hengfu. Seven people left with his son Miao Wenlei last night, all of whom were members of the Flame squad, plus his son Miao Wenlei, there were eight people in total. They spent last night eating and drinking at the Millionaires’ Club, and left in this morning.</p><p>Miao Hengfu saw the road surveillance video sent by the traffic police team. What made him fly into a rage was that his bastard son even tied a little girl to the roof of the car, and then drove in a very fast speed along the central city road to the mountain of the center.</p><p>“Guo Qiang, take someone to find them.”</p><p>Miao Hengfu called the leader of the Flame squad, who was also a confidant hatchet man of him.</p><p>In Tang Zhuang Martial Arts School.</p><p>Tang Xiu had received a report from Zidan, and when he heard that Zhenlei Duomu of the Reston turned out to be a super master, he immediately became interested. Zidan and Ye Shisan were both cultivators, and they had both reached the Foundation Establishment Stage. But when facing Zhenlei Duomu, they should feel inferior. Tang Xiu was curious about the identity of Zhenlei Duomu.</p><p>“Do you want to go in person?”</p><p>Tang Han asked with a hesitant look on her face.</p><p>Tang Xiu nodded and said, “I do have the interest to look at the situation. After all, it’s abnormal for a foreign mafia to obtain such super strength. Sister, wait for me at Tang Zhuang Martial Arts School! I set up a scheme, which not only aim at Miao Hengfu and the Reston but also two stronger forces are involved. As long as everything progress according to my schedule, many crises in Mist Source Island can be solved.” Original translation from Www。WangmamaRead。Com。</p><p>Tang Han said, “I will go with you! Although I have not yet become a martial arts grandmaster, I’m only one step from this stage. In addition, I will bring a group of masters with us in case of emergency.”</p><p>Tang Xiu waved his hand and said, “Sister, I know your thoughts. But since Grandpa has sent me over, it proves that I have the power to resolve it. You can rest assured that few masters were my dread on the entire Mist Source Island, the reason for schemes and intrigues using is that I can’t be bothered to do it myself. Besides, Tang Zhuang Martial Arts School is the back support of our Tang sect on Mist Source Island. So it would be better to hide it low-profile as much as possible.”</p><p>Tang Han hesitated before he nodded and said, “Well! You need to be safe, while there’s life there’s hope, never put yourself at risk.”</p><p>“I know it very well.”</p><p>After the reply, Tang Xiu drove the car alone, leaving Tang Zhuang Martial Arts School. Late at night, he had met and gathered with Ye Shisan and Zidan in the forest more than ten kilometers away of north Mixed Summit City.</p><p>“How come only you two? Where’re other people?”</p><p>Ye Shisan said with respect, “They all went to inquire about the news. We have already arranged the layout though, the following plot still needs to be concerned. We can adjust the plan anytime in case of an accident, or add fuel to the fire.”</p><p>Tang Xiu said with a smile, “I can count on you guys. But how about the Miao?”</p><p>Ye Shisan said, “Zhang Jue is in charge of overseeing the Miao. And two hours and fifteen minutes ago, I was told that Miao Hengfu’s confidant Guo Qiang had led dozens of security guards from Qingyuan Group and rushed to the place where we killed Miao Wenlei. Besides, Hei Xiong also told me that Miao Wenlei and another seven people’s mobile phone was being called. Hei Xiong picked up one of them, only for three or four minutes though, the time period should be enough.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
