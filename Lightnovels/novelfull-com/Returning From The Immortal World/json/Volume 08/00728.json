It would be best if he could win smoothly, but if he struggled for victory, then the final champion is none other than Han Qingwu.” Chu Xuecheng thought silently.</p><p>In another place, behind the seats of the auditorium, Zhou Chong and Chen Shuai exchanged dismayed looks. Their hearts were as though falling into an ice hole as their complexion turned very nasty.</p><p>“To be alive is a great feeling indeed. Now I finally realize the deeper meaning of this sentence.” Chen Shuai raised his hand to caress his neck and said bitterly.</p><p>“She’s really too strong. For anyone who can go all the way to the top four of the underground fighting arena, they are definitely not weak. But even for the Savage Beast Li Tong to not last for half a minute and be beaten to death by her…” Zhou Chong interjected with a complicated expression. “Chen Shuai, I’m now very grateful to Ji Mu. If he did not appear in time, I’m afraid that we…”</p><p>He could not continue speaking anymore after speaking up to there. However, Chen Shuai knew perfectly well what he wanted to say. He took a deep breath and then said, “After watching this game, we’ll immediately call Ji Mu and ask him when he has time to have dinner with us so as to express our gratitude to him.”</p><p>“Yeah.” Zhou Chong nodded silently.</p><p>“Ji Mu is our savior. Should we send him some gifts as tokens of our gratitude?” Asked Chen Shuai.</p><p>Zhou Chong thought for a moment and said, “We must thank him and send him a thank you gift. We gotta discuss the appropriate thank you gift after this fighting match.”</p><p>“I heard Ji Mu has been buying precious medicinal herbs in these two days.” Chen Shuai’s expression suddenly moved and spoke in a low voice.</p><p>“Huh?” Zhou Chong looked doubtful and wondered, “What is Ji Mu buying precious herbs for? Is he ill? Or a family member…”</p><p>“I dunno.” Chen Shuai shook his head. “It’s just a rumor, so I’m not really sure. I will, however, tell my friend to ask around after the fighting match. If it’s true, then we’ll send him some precious herbs.”</p><p>“No problem!” Zhou Chong nodded and looked pensive.</p><p>Black Widow, who stood under the ring and watched as Savage Beast Li Tong was struck and defeated in less than half a minute, could not help but tremble. She was an expert herself, and even though she had yet to reach the martial arts grandmaster level and could be extremely cruel and merciless, she was still shocked nonetheless.</p><p>What a dreadful person! It turns out that Ice Phoenix Han Qingwu has never unleashed her full power.</p><p>Her gaze shifted from Han Qingwu and looked at the fallen Li Tong on the floor, who was no longer moving. She shivered and sighed inwardly, before she stepped onto the platform again to check his condition. Following that, she walked to Han Qingwu’s side and applauded, “The Ice Phoenix—Han Qingwu has really concealed herself too deeply. I now announce that Savage Beast, Li Tong, has died. The winner is HAN QINGWU!”</p><p>“Ice Phoenix Han Qingwu, you can take a break in the backstage. Your second match will start at 10.”</p><p>Han Qingwu nodded. She glanced at Tang Xiu’s direction and immediately replied, then turned around to leave the ring.</p><p>The second match.</p><p>After Ironfist Jin Can and Ladyboy Wu Tong came onto the ring, the two men showcased their soaring fighting intent. Even Tang Xiu, who was sitting in the back row of the auditorium, spared his time to observe the two fighters. Following which, he turned to Chu Xuecheng and lightly smiled, “Brother Chu have good eyes. That Ladyboy Wu Tong seems so weak that even the wind can blow him away, but he’s undeniably formidable. Also, he should have killed quite a lot of people.”</p><p>“Brother Tang is kidding me. I can’t even be compared to you. The one you favor, Han Qingwu, easily killed Savage Beast Li Tong, and the result won’t affect her second match. Though this Ladyboy Wu Tong is indeed very strong, yet he would probably be injured and badly battered even if he is able to defeat Ironfist Jin Can. For him to lose in his second match against Han Qingwu is quite likely.”</p><p>Tang Xiu just smiled in response and did not talk anymore. Han Qingwu was just unwilling to fully unleash her strength. As long as she made up her mind to go for the kill, she would definitely become the champion. Tang Xiu had confidence in her as well as the Everlasting Feast Hall’s expert who had taught her.</p><p>As expected, the close quarter fight ended very slowly. Ironfist Jin Can and Ladyboy Wu Tong engaged in an intense fight for more than 10 minutes before the outcome was finally revealed. The winner was the Ladyboy Wu Tong, yet he was also covered with several injuries as well as heavy internal injuries after killing Ironfist Jin Can.</p><p>10:00.</p><p>Black Widow stood in the ring again. Her complexion was a bit unsightly, and there was even faint anger in her eyes. She held the microphone and suppressed her anger as she announced, “Next is our final match. Ice Phoenix Han Qinwu and Ladyboy Wu Tong, please come to the ring!”</p><p>After a while, the two people stood on the ring.</p><p>Black Widow held her breath and fiercely glared at the injured Ladyboy, Wu Tong, and coldly said, “Without further ado, I announce the match begins... NOW!”</p><p>Wu Tong shot a deep gaze at Han Qingwu before he immediately shook his head and said, “To those friends who have placed their bets on me, I can only say I’m sorry to all of you. I’m so seriously injured that I can hardly support myself. Hence, I admit defeat.”</p><p>“YOU WHAT? YOU JUST ADMITTED DEFEAT LIKE THAT?”</p><p>“WHAT THE FUCK? WHAT PRANK ARE YOU PULLING? THIS LAST GAME OF THE UNDERGROUND FIGHTING MATCH IS THE ONE I’M MOST ANTICIPATING. HOW CAN IT BE OVER LIKE THIS? THIS BIG DADDY HAS ALREADY BET 50 MILLION YUAN…”</p><p>“HEY WU TONG! I’LL FIND A WAY TO KILL YOU IF YOU GIVE UP!”</p><p>“I PAID TO SEE YOU TO KILL! SHOW ME BLOOD!!!”</p><p>“NO BALLS DICKHEAD! YOU’LL REGRET FOR CROSSING ME!!!”</p><p>“…”</p><p>Many rich men stood up and cursed furiously, a lot of them directly throwing out threats.</p><p>Wu Tong did not stay for long. Despite his strength, the anger of a lot of rich and powerful people was not something he could afford to face. He knew what situation he was in and only a dead end was there for him if he continued the fight. While those rich people would be targeting him after the competition, yet he believed he could preserve his life, and could just leave China if worse came to worst.</p><p>Han Qingwu was also very surprised, for she never thought that Wu Tong would choose to admit defeat directly. Originally, she planned to resort to killing if Wu Tong had the intention to kill, but now it seemed that her victory was already settled.</p><p>In the audience, Li Laoshan glanced at the pale Chu Xuecheng as he immediately laughed loudly, “Hahaha… Old Chu! I never thought to be so lucky today. Not only did I meet Brother Tang here, but also pocketed 700 million yuan as well. Damn, this is really such a great and joyous event. Brother Tang, spare the talk, let’s just go to the backstage to exchange this receipt to bank notes. This Old Li must treat you to a drink.”</p><p>Tang Xiu only smiled. The reason why he came along with Han Qingwu to Changxi was that he was afraid she would have an accident in the underground fighting match. He had yet to have an answer from her, and definitely did not want her to die in such a match.</p><p>What was accidental was that he followed Li Laoshan to gamble and won quite a lot of money.</p><p>“Okay, let’s go!”</p><p>Just as Tang Xiu let out a smile, Li Laoshan dragged him away. Ji Mu was similarly looking happy and followed them to the backstage. Though his wager was not much, the odds were quite high, so he also earned quite a lot!</p><p>Half an hour later, Tang Xiu, Li Laoshan, Ji Mu and Chu Xuecheng had already taken the elevator to the surface. Without much delay, Han Qingwu, who had changed clothes, came before them.</p><p>“Feeling happy?” Asked Tang Xiu.</p><p>Han Qingwu nodded. With a smile hanging on her face, she said, “Of course, winning money is a happy thing. But I’m not thrilled for the match, though, since I was kinda excited to fight that Ladyboy Wu Tong.”</p><p>“Well, I’ll send you to Jingmen Island later if you want to have a good fight,” said Tang Xiu smilingly.</p><p>Han Qingwu’s smile turned stiff. She immediately shook her head and said, “No, thanks. Forget it!”</p><p>Tang Xiu chuckled and asked, “Anyways, did you place a bet as well? How much did you win?”</p><p>“I bet 20 million yuan and won more than 100 million,” said Han Qingwu. “I’m a young rich woman now.”</p><p>“Huh? I don’t recall your family being short on money, no?” Tang Xiu snappily said. “Do you really want to live on your own without asking for support from your family?”</p><p>Han Qingwu realized that Tang Xiu knew her grandfather, so he should know about the situation in her family. She then nodded and smilingly said, “I usually spend little, but earning myself quite some money is not bad, you know.”</p><p>Tang Xiu only smiled and did not continue talking about this subject, but pointed to Li Laoshan and Chu Xuecheng and introduced them to her.</p><p>Straightforward as he was, Li Laoshan, who won more than 600 million yuan because of Han Qingwu, patted his chest and said, “Miss Han, I gotta say thanks to you this time! I won more than 600 million yuan because of you! This Old Li probably won’t be able to earn this much from my business in a year or two. So I wanna invite you to have some snacks tonight, but this Old Li will prepare you a lavish thank you gift when I visit Shanghai later.”</p><p>“There’s no need for this.” Han Qingwu smiled. “It’s your fortune, Brother Li. Just choose a good place to have some snacks tonight. It’s fine already.”</p><p>“Nope, a snack is a must and so is the lavish gift,” said Li Laoshan crisply. “Anyhow, Brother Ji, you’re the local snake of Changxi, so you should know the best place for a night snack, right? This Old Li is very happy tonight, so take us to the best place!”</p><p>Brother Ji?</p><p>Ji Mu shivered inwardly. He had secretly browsed the Internet while watching the matches, searching information about Li Laoshan. The result was quite a shock to him since he learned that Li Laoshan was the Iron Steel Magnate from the Northern Region with a net worth of over 10 billion yuan. Though he was a scion from the Ji Family, he did not have the qualification to be addressed as Brother by this man at all. It was more appropriate if it was his father.</p><p>He simply benefitted from associating with someone else!</p><p>Ji Mu secretly glanced at Tang Xiu and saw that the latter nodded to him. He then let out a dry smile and said, “I won quite a lot tonight, too, Brother Li. You are originally a guest, so treating several brothers should be on me as the host! Whenever Brother Li has some time to spare in the future, feel free to invite us.”</p><p>Tonight was a night of harvest and thus became a pleasant night.</p><p>It was already 1:30 when the five finished the night snack. Tang Xiu drank a lot of wine and felt a bit drunk since he had not forced the alcohol out of his body. As for Li Laoshan and Chu Xuecheng, both of them drank a lot, so Ji Mu tried to find a few Ji Family’s men to escort them and book a good hotel in advance when they left.</p><p>However, Li Laoshan dragged Tang Xiu at parting time to tell him that he wanted to see him tomorrow and go to Shanghai together. Tang Xiu did not ask for what affair he was going to tend to, while Li Laoshan himself did not explain anything.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
