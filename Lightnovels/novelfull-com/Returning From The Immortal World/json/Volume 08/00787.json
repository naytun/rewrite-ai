Full of excitement on his face, he quickly issued an order for the soldiers to withdraw.</p><p>“All of them have withdrawn five kilometers, Mr. Tang.”</p><p>With the corners of his mouth raised, Tang Xiu’s feet stepped in midair as he paced forward dozens of meters up the coastline as if there were an invisible ladder in front of him.</p><p>“Heavens! W… What am I seeing now?!!”</p><p>Yang Chuxiong’s heart pounded quickly and his eyes went wide in amazement. He would have never believed that someone could walk in midair had he not witnessed it with his own eyes.</p><p>This… was he still a human?</p><p>In that instant, only then did Yang Chuxiong realize why this youngster he once held with contempt was sent by the First Leader of the country to solve the crisis in Mist Source Island. This young man was simply a god-like figure!</p><p>Tang Xiu was not aware of the shocked Yang Chuxiong, nor did he have the time to care about the man. His eyes gazed around and his hands slowly opened a moment after. In an instant, a suppressing aura suddenly erupted out of his body. Despite being one of the great personages in the country, Yang Chuxiong was suddenly frightened by the surging aura from Tang Xiu. At this moment, the sensation he felt from Tang Xiu was like a sudden emergence of a big mountain in front of him.</p><p>“Activate…”</p><p>A deep voice came from Tang Xiu’s mouth, along with the torrential power of Chaos Primal Force releasing from his hands and which instantly fused into the array midair. Suddenly, a rippling layer of qi emerged from the sky. Adorned, indistinct ancient runes appeared in the rippling air and then spread to both sides very quickly.</p><p>Ten minutes after.</p><p>Tang Xiu’s body suddenly trembled. His face turned very pale and his body quickly floated down. In the twinkling of an eye, he appeared in front of Yang Chuxiong. The moment his feet landed on the ground, he staggered forward for two steps as Mo Awu hastily rushed to support him.</p><p>“Boss…” A worried look crept over Mo Awu’s face.</p><p>Tang Xiu raised his hand, shaking his head and said, “I’m fine. It’s just that I’ve overdrafted my power. I’ll be fine after cultivating for two days. The area of Mist Source Island is too large and the energy required to activate the entire array is rather huge. It seems that my cultivation level is still not enough.”</p><p>“To be honest, your cultivation level is improving rapidly, Boss,” said Mo Awu with admiration. “I believe you’ll be able to reach a much higher level quickly.”</p><p>Tang Xiu smiled faintly. He looked at a stunned Yang Chuxion and said, “Division Commander Yang, the mission has been accomplished and the Feng Shui array has also been laid out and activated. The distance between these two pillars is 24 meters wide; these will act as the entrance to Mist Source Island. I’ll let you know how to open this entrance. Later, whoever you assign to be stationed in this place will have nothing to do with me. Also, I will let you know the position of the exit and then the rest of the minor matters will be yours to handle.”</p><p>While watching the corrugated qi flow that was slowly dissipating to be like before, Yang Chuxiong finally came back to his senses after the shock. He looked at Tang Xiu and replied, “I’ll arrange it, Mr. Tang.”</p><p>The next day.</p><p>Tang Xiu, Mo Awu, and the rest finally left Mist Source Island. He had only restored half of his Chaos Primal Force, but the weak sensation he had felt had completely vanished. He now stood on the bow of the ship while looking at the vast sea with a bit of a complicated expression on his face.</p><p>He recalled the tearful Tang Han who was reluctant to be left alone as he left the Tang Manor Martial School last night. At this moment, he mulled over the thought of what he would do after arriving in the mainland, like reporting and suggesting his idea about the matters on Mist Source Island when he met the old Patriarch. The present Tang Family was no longer the Tang Family in the past, for their family would be safe as long as he was still alive. Moreover, the projects in the Nine Dragons Island would be done within a few months. They could use it as the most important escape plan for the Tang Family.</p><p>“Are we going straight to Jingmen Island, Mr. Tang??” asked Zhenlei Duomo, who was clad in a black leather coat when she came to Tang Xiu’s side.</p><p>Tang Xiu looked at her face and indifferently said, “Indeed.”</p><p>“Can I see her soon?” she asked quickly.</p><p>Tang Xiu didn’t rush to answer but asked instead, “Zhenlei, what are people living for? What would you do if you were stronger?”</p><p>Zhenlei Duomo stared blankly and immediately fell into silence What was the point in living? Was it to live in happiness? What would she do if she were to have even more strength?</p><p>Would it be to have wealth and fortune? Or… would it be to have power and privileges?</p><p>She fell into thought for a long time, only to shake her head with an expression of being at a loss and said, “I don’t know. I only know that I just want to live, survive, and go on living. I just want to live better.”</p><p>“Only a handful of people can claim your life given your present strength. More so now that you are at the Foundation Establishment stage; you can even live much longer than ordinary people.” Tang Xiu spoke and asked again, “With such a long time to live, do you have anything to pursue?”</p><p>“What about you? Do you have something you want to pursue?” asked Zhenlei Duomo.</p><p>“You wanna know about my pursuits?”</p><p>There was somewhat a strange expression on Tang Xiu’s face as he replied slowly, “What I am pursuing is probably bigger than your pursuits, as I want to live as long as Heaven and Earth exist. I want to stand above the myriads of races. Maybe, I will become a God one day and ascend to God’s Realm just like those in the legends.”</p><p>Becoming a God in God’s Realm?</p><p>There was mockery on her face, for she never believed that there were immortals or gods in this world. If immortals and gods really existed, the Earth wouldn’t have turned out like this. Hence, she thought that Tang Xiu was indulging in his wildest fantasy and living in his own illusion!</p><p>Tang Xiu was keenly aware of the ridicule on Zhenlei Duomo’s face. He just calmly smiled and said, “Now tell me. What do you really wanna do in the future?”</p><p>“I want to be the Empress of all the organized crime syndicates in the world,” she replied after taking a deep breath.</p><p>Cough, cough…</p><p>Her reply had nearly made Tang Xiu choke to death.</p><p>She wanted to be a kingpin of organized crime syndicates…?</p><p>What was the likelihood of that?</p><p>It was very hard for him to imagine that there was cultivator who was supposed to go against the heavens but instead wanted to be the head honcho of a bunch of gangsters… More so that the one who wanted to pursue it… was a woman…</p><p>Zhenlei Duomo’s dream truly left Tang Xiu speechless. He didn’t even have the urge to ridicule her. He turned back and went straight to the cabin and waited for the liner to arrive at Jingmen Island. His endeavor on Mist Source Island could be said to have resulted in an abundant harvest. At least he wouldn’t have any troubles in obtaining cultivation resources for quite some time.</p><p>It could even be said that he could have a breakthrough to a higher level soon. Moreover, he would definitely be able to go anywhere on Earth unhindered once Gu Yan’er’s strength was restored.</p><p>Four in the afternoon.</p><p>The passenger liner docked at the shore of JIngmen Island. Right as Tang Xiu walked out of the cabin, he saw Gu Yan’er’s slim and graceful posture on the shore. Donned in a fluttering white dress, she looked like an otherworldly pure female celestial, with her suffocatingly beautiful looks and excited expression.</p><p>Whoosh…</p><p>A figure instantly flashed behind Tang Xiu lightning fast. In nearly a blink of an eye, Zhenlei Duomo then appeared in front of Gu Yan’er.</p><p>“You are…”</p><p>Zhenlei Duomo stared at Gu Yan’er with disbelief all over her face. The latter’s otherworldly face had been deeply carved inside her heart, yet it had been two decades and Gu Yan’er’s appearance hadn’t changed in the slightest. She still looked so young and beautiful, leading to an incredulous feeling inside her.</p><p>Gu Yan’er’s eyes reluctantly parted from Tang Xiu and then landed on Zhenlei Duomo’s face. She looked slightly stunned, as her eyes then widened and she said with a surprised tone, “You are… Little Duomo?”</p><p>Tears flowing on her face, Zhenlei Duomo’s white teeth bit her lower lip, and she replied in a trembling voice, “It’s really you… I’m not dreaming. But you… you’re still looking so young and beautiful.”</p><p>With a happy look on her face, Gu Yan’er smilingly replied, “I also didn’t expect that I’d see you again after so many years. You’ve grown up, Little Duomo.”</p><p>“You forbade me to come to China previously, I’ve been suppressing myself many many times to come when I wanted to see you again. C-could… could I call you Mother? B-because, you’re my mother in my heart.”</p><p>Mother?</p><p>Gu Yan’er was somewhat at a loss whether to laugh or cry. She had never married, so how could she have a child? Besides, she had raised too many children; there were hundreds of them. If every one of them were to call her Mother, wouldn’t she become the woman with the most children?</p><p>“Just call me Master!”</p><p>Gu Yan’er subconsciously glanced at Tang Xiu who was approaching and replied slowly. She could bear a child, but she wanted the child as her own and, most importantly, that child be from him.</p><p>Zhenlei Duomo knew well what the meaning of ‘Master’ was, so she didn’t hesitate to kneel before Gu Yan’er and solemnly kowtow thrice, before kneeling again and say, “But you won’t leave me alone anymore again, Master?”</p><p>“I had important things to deal with in the past, so I made up an excuse to leave you abroad and still kept you out due to the condition of my body.” Gu Yan’er sighed and said, “But… how did you come back with your Grand Master?”</p><p>Grand Master?</p><p>“Do you mean… him, Master?” Zhenlei Duomo looked at Tang Xiu, shocked and surprised.</p><p>“Don’t be impolite, Little Duomo!” Gu Yan’er immediately rebuked, “He’s my Master and naturally your Grand Master.”</p><p>“B-but Master, his age…” replied Zhenlei Duomo with disbelief. “Master, I know my mistake. Greetings, Grand Master.”</p><p>Tang Xiu faintly smiled and said, “You wanna ask why I’m so young, eh? Hahaha… I indeed look very young. But take a look at your Master, doesn’t she look very young too? Actually, once cultivators have reached a very high realm, their aging will appear to slow down greatly and they even stay young forever.”</p><p>The revelation shocked Zhenlei Duomo. She was a woman, how could she not want to stay young forever? Her expression suddenly glowed.</p><p>Gu Yan’er looked at Tang Xiu as they walked together for a few steps. She gently embraced him and said, “Master, Yan’er has been missing you so much.”</p><p>Her actions made Tang Xiu somewhat at a loss whether he had to laugh or cry. “Yan’er, we have so many people here looking at us! Even your disciples are here too, you know.”</p><p>Gu Yan’er shook her head and gently said, “I’ve been living for thousands of years. What kinds of things have I not experienced? Master has always been the most important in my heart. I miss you, I really miss you. I don’t need to hide it in front of anyone.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
