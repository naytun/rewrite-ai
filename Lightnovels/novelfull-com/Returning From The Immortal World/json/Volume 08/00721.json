She had been living in Changxi for many years, and even though her Yu Family could not be considered as a top-ranked family here, they were still a mid-ranked one and naturally understood the thoughts of the juniors of these families.</p><p>This farce, however, related to the faces of the two families, and even if Ji Mu was full of arrogance, it was highly unlikely he would do anything to shame them both.</p><p>In the beginning, she liked Tang Xiu a bit. After all, this guy was the man her good sister had a crush on. But now it seemed like this fella was ignorant about the situation as well as a boaster, simply courting humiliation upon himself.</p><p>At the restaurant’s door, Ren Ranran stood there, with a face full of expectation. She was sure Ji Mu would not refuse her. Her good sisters incited and encouraged her to bet on this rugged, dangerous move. She liked Ji Mu a lot, to the point this feeling was carved deep down inside. And yet, she also realized that this guy felt just a bit affection toward her, and had yet to turn into liking, let alone love.</p><p>“You know my character, Ji Mu. What I hate the most is to have the Family do some kind of acrobatic for an arranged marriage. But ever since three years ago when you escorted me to the hospital due to my illness, only then did I realize that I liked you. The longer the time passed, the deeper this feeling got. My feeling for you is pure, uncontaminated by our so-called status. I like you even if you have nothing and I will follow you with all my heart, till death do us part. Please promise me… to marry… no, to take me as your wife.”</p><p>Ji Mu, however, frowned deeply, and there was anger when he looked at her.</p><p>Was the child… she said… anything but only a chip? While she used their statuses to force him under the public witness?</p><p>Ji Mu sneered inside, then took out a cigarette and lit it up under everyone’s watchful eyes. He did not wish to hurt Ren Ranran, but he did not want to be forced either. Had it been a couple days ago, he might have felt pressured due to their statuses and thus promise her. But now…</p><p>“I used to think that you were a smart woman, Ranran. At the very least, you did not pester me after what happened between us last time. So much so that I would start liking you if you were to work this out step by step and had exchanges with me just like how you used to. However… what you are doing today is anything but smart. Aren’t you just using my child as a chip to force me? Like you are using our statuses in Changxi?</p><p>“I, Ji Mu, am not a man who treats affections and love like a child’s play. If there was really a bond that tied our heart, I would be the one to take the initiative to court you and swear to give a happy life, so you would not need to use this kind of means to coerce me.</p><p>“But now…</p><p>“I refuse!”</p><p>Ren Ranran was stunned and dumbfounded. She had never dreamed that Ji Mu’s reaction would be this intense, so much that the attitude he showed her was like that of… abhorrence.</p><p>Is it wrong? Is my love for him a mistake?</p><p>I have given you my body to the point that I’m now carrying your child.</p><p>So why?</p><p>For what reason he’s ignoring the two families’ faces, even refusing me so heartlessly like this?</p><p>Tears like beads were falling down her face as Ren Ranran desperately shook her head. Her hand that held the megaphone was trembling, as she loudly said, “I don’t have the intention to force you, and neither am I threatening you, Ji Mu. What I’m doing today is just because I wanted you to know how much I really love you. For I, Ren Ranran, will do whatever you want even if I must cast away any constraints a woman must have and throw away my honor and reputation just to be with you.”</p><p>“Sorry.” Ji Mu indifferently shook his head.</p><p>On the second floor’s window.</p><p>Yu Hong was tongue-tied and dumbfounded as she watched the drama unfold. However smart her brain was, it simply ceased to work at this moment. Her expression when she turned her head to look at Tang Xiu was full of disbelief.</p><p>“How is this possible?” Her voice was trembling.</p><p>Tang Xiu only let out a tranquil smile since he had already predicted this result. Had Ji Mu not obtained the cultivation technique from him, he might have no will nor energy to refuse. At the very least, he would try to preserve the Ji and Ren Families’ honor and reputation. But now… even the elders of the Ji Family would not blame him, moreover… they would not dare to blame him.</p><p>“Anyways, there are things I need to tend to in this month, so I’m afraid I can’t enjoy the banquet you will hold for a time. But if you do still want to realize your promise, throw the feast for Teacher Han since she has quite a lot of time to spare!”</p><p>Yu Hong gaped and looked somewhat awkward and flushed. Recalling as how she despised Tang Xiu when they started the bet, she now felt that it was her that was ludicrous.</p><p>“Tang Xiu, you already know Ji Mu, don’t you?” Suddenly, this thought sprung up in Yu Hong’s heart and she suddenly asked.</p><p>Tang Xiu himself did not try to hide it as he nodded and said, “I do. We’ve met a couple of times.”</p><p>Yu Hong was left without words. Originally, she thought that Tang Xiu was a man who did not know the situation at all, a ridiculous boaster who bragged about things. Never did she expect that this guy turned out to have acquainted himself with that young master Ji. Now it was apparent that he was really confident when he made the bet with her, and was not just a braggart! She, on the contrary, foolishly held contempt toward him instead of taking a clear picture of the situation.</p><p>As she thought up to there, Yu Hong really wished that there was a hole on the floor where she could burrow herself into. She really had no face to see him again.</p><p>Tang Xiu then looked at the tearful Ren Ranran. His expression moved all of a sudden as he turned to look Yu Hong again and said with a smile, “Do you dare to make another bet?”</p><p>Yu Hong scornfully rolled her eyes at him and replied in a bitter tone, “You just won against me, what else can I bet with you?”</p><p>“I bet that Ji Mu will take his words back and accept Ren Ranran. Do you believe it or not?” Tang Xiu smiled.</p><p>Again, Yu Hong blanked and immediately rolled her eyes again, saying, “Are you still sane? Ji Mu has just firmly refused, and he did that in public. How the hell would he possibly take back his words given his character, huh?”</p><p>“I told you, do you dare to bet or not?” Asked Tang Xiu again.</p><p>Yu Hong hesitated for a bit and then said, “Fine. I’m in. I’ll treat you for two months if you win, but we’ll be even if you lose.”</p><p>“Deal.”</p><p>Tang Xiu smiled, got up to press his hands on the window, looked below and shouted, “Hey, Young Master Ji, when a woman throws away her dignity and reveals her innermost affection towards her love, it means that the man is the one who gains! Besides, she’s already carrying your child, so why don’t you take responsibility as a man? I heard that an irresponsible man will have a notorious reputation. That’s right, someone told me that grinding a chopper won’t delay the work of cutting firewood. You may have tons of other important things to do, but you still must have a family sooner or later!”</p><p>Below…</p><p>The moment Ji Mu heard that familiar voice, his whole being suddenly froze. When he looked up and saw Tang Xiu, his eyes were filled with disbelief, for he did not expect that he would see Tang Xiu here. Subsequently, the awkwardness and embarrassed drove him to secretly produce a wry and bitter smile. Tang Xiu had unexpectedly been watching all the while. This… was… virtually… shame and disgrace at its highest.</p><p>Nevertheless, he gave it a thought and suddenly felt that what Tang Xiu just said was reasonable. Ren Ranran even cast away her restraint and dignity as a woman, meaning that she had sealed her own path, and that the feeling she had for him was pure and sincere.</p><p>Like Tang Xiu said, grinding a chopper does not mean that the work of cutting wood will be delayed, while those “other things” he said should be pointed to his cultivation. Having a family while immersing himself in cultivation could indeed be carried out without affecting each other.</p><p>Should I bear the responsibility… or not?</p><p>Ji Mu’s face was constantly changing as he slowly clenched his fists.</p><p>The tearful Ren Ranran also heard Tang Xiu’s words and felt grateful inside. She did not know Tang Xiu, but she secretly decided to express her gratitude regardless of whether Ji Mu would eventually accept her or not.</p><p>At this moment, a woman in the crowd in black leather attire and holding a helmet suddenly looked up, stroked the hair on her forehead and shouted to Tang Xiu:</p><p>“HEY, YOU, HANDSOME! YOU SHOULD BE A RESPONSIBLE MAN SINCE YOU SAID THAT! DO YOU HAVE A GIRLFRIEND, BY CHANCE? IF NOT, WHY DON’T YOU CONSIDER ME?”</p><p>The originally smiling Tang Xiu suddenly froze. He scratched the back of his head with an expression of being at a loss whether he had to cry or laugh, and said, “Sorry, girl! I already got a good wife at home, so there’s no bed left for you!”</p><p>With that said, he straightly pulled back his head and picked up the teacup with discomfiture.</p><p>All this while, Han Qingwu had yet to speak anything, but the smile on the corner of her mouth had not receded. She suddenly could not bear to chuckle and laugh upon seeing Tang Xiu who was now trying to conceal his discomfiture by picking up his teacup. Though Tang Xiu did say he wanted to have a bet with her good sister—Yu Hong a while ago, all in all, it turned out that he wanted to bring the romance to a happy ending, hence it made her feel that he just did a good job.</p><p>In contrast, Yu Hong felt different and could not help but roll her eyes after hearing Tang Xiu. At this moment, she saw the way Han Qingwu looked at Tang Xiu and suddenly couldn’t bear to comment, “Tang Xiu, Ji Mu is a scion of the notable Ji Family in Changxi, whose eyes are always looking at the top. Do you think he will change his mind just because of your superficial words? Forget it, buddy.”</p><p>“Whether or not he’ll change his mind, who knows?” Tang Xiu put down the teacup and shrugged with a smile.</p><p>At the entrance to the restaurant.</p><p>Ji Mu’s expression was still changing constantly. He looked at the tearful Ren Ranran, who was full of longing and anticipation. Eventually, he sighed inwardly and stepped forward. After he came before her, he gently wiped the tears on her face and said, “I have no vigorous and true love to give you. But if you are willing to be with me, give me three days. I’ll talk to the elders of my family and then visit yours to discuss our marriage. Even if we can’t marry, we can at least have an engagement first. Love is not a child’s play, so give me some time to slowly nurture it.”</p><p>Ren Ranran blinked, and tears flowed down from her eyes again. It was not sad tears this time, but tears of joy. She nodded repeated with a joyful expression, tightly hugged Ji Mu and released him, and then quickly said, “Please wait a bit.”</p><p>With that said, she grabbed the sides of her bridal gown and ran into the restaurant. Under everyone’s watchful eyes, she walked upstairs to the second floor, came to Tang Xiu’s front, who was near the window, and then said with a grateful expression, “Thank you so much, Sir. I, Ren Ranran, might have not only lost my love but also my future happiness had it not because of your words today. I will always remember this benevolence and kindness. Please let me know if you have anything that requires my assistance, and I’ll definitely do it to the best of my abilities.”</p><p>“This girl is not bad.” Tang Xiu secretly nodded.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
