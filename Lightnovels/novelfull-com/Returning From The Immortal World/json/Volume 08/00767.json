Tang Xiu sat decently on the soft sofa and watched Tang Han preparing the tea and snacks, he felt warm inside. They didn’t talk a lot outside, but after entering the study, they had a pleasant chat.</p><p>“Brother, try this Pu’er tea and tell me about it.”</p><p>Tang Han sat down opposite Tang Xiu and then said with a smile.</p><p>Tang Xiu picked up the small teacup and gently sipped his tea, nodding and praising, “The tea drinker can fully enjoy the tea with a simple sip, as the scent of tea is lingering among his lips and teeth. Sister, this tea is really good.”</p><p>Tang Han’s eyes lit up and she praised with a thumbs up, “You’re indeed an educated man from Shanghai University, each word counts. If you like it, I will give you all the rest of the highest grade Pu’er tea.”</p><p>Tang Xiu smiled and said, “Sister, a gentleman will never take others’ favorites away. I usually have little time to calm down and drink tea. Even if you give it to me, it’s also a waste. When I have more time, I will visit you more frequently, then you can treat me with the Pu’er tea.”</p><p>“That’s a deal.”</p><p>Smiling slightly, Tang Han took the electric swatter, turned on the switch and touched it with her finger. The electrostatic currents flowed into her body and helped suppress the Darkening Virus in her body.</p><p>When Tang Xiu saw it, he got up and came to Tang Han. In her horrified eyes, Tang Xiu reached out and grabbed her wrist. After half a minute, Tang Xiu said, “Sister, send someone to get me a bowl of clean water. In addition, you have been running Tang Zhuang Martial Arts School for so many years, you must have some confidants, get them here as well.”</p><p>Tang Han was confused, “What for?”</p><p>Tang Xiu said, “I can help to clear the toxins of the Darkening Virus out of your body.”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>Tang Han suddenly jumped up from the sofa and asked in shock: “Brother, you just said you could cure infectious diseases?”</p><p>Tang Xiu replied: “Yes, I can.”</p><p>Tang Han said in great excitement: “I know you are a highly-skilled doctor in the field of traditional Chinese medicine, but I didn’t expect you to be so powerful that you can treat the infectious disease caused by the Darkening Virus. Wait a moment, I’ll call them over at once.”</p><p>Tang Xiu stopped her and said with a wry smile: “Sister, my treatment will be very special and I need something different. Don’t let others know that I can cure the infectious disease caused by the Darkening Virus. Except for the people you trust the most, please don’t bring anyone over or tell him about it.”</p><p>Tang Han was confused, “Why?”</p><p>Tang Xiu continued: “The drug for this infectious disease is very special. Even if I produce medications round the clock, I am afraid I can’t cure all the people on Mist Source Island. Besides, the price is too high to save all the people, even if we use our last resource.”</p><p>Tang Han suddenly lost the light and said with regret: “Using the static electricity to suppress the Darkening Virus can not treat the disease’s root cause but its symptoms. Besides, static electricity does great harm to the human body. If I fail to eliminate the Darkening Virus, I am afraid that…”</p><p>Tang Xiu said with a wry smile: “the Divine Doctor Gui Jianchou is developing the antidote, and the government will also send over a large number of medical experts. I’m a traditional Chinese doctor, but I am not a sage. I must put the stress on the people I care about the most.”</p><p>“OK.”</p><p>Tang Han felt warm in her heart and slightly nodded,</p><p>“In Tang Zhuang Martial Arts School, there are 12 people worthy of my trust. They are all my loyal supporters and have contributed a lot to our Tang sect. In addition, all 206 people of the armed team trained by myself are also loyal and reliable. You see… are these people too many?”</p><p>“Original translation from Www。WangmamaRead。Com。”</p><p>Tang Xiu shook his head and said, “These people are enough. Hurry up to gather them together. I will treat others once you are cured.”</p><p>“Okay.”</p><p>Not long after Tang Han went out, then she came back carrying a bowl of clean water. Watching Tang Xiu smashed a pill and threw half of it into it, she took the bowl and drank all of the water in accordance with Tang Xiu’s instructions.</p><p>A warm stream surged in her internal like the tide, and the sense of weakness the Darkening Virus brought to her was now dissipating with surprising speed. Although she couldn’t see what was happening in the body, she could feel that after the comfort the warm stream brought to her, the prickling pain sprang up from her whole body.</p><p>She could bear the pain if it was temporary.</p><p>The prolonged ache, however, made her suffer.</p><p>But she believed that Tang Xiu wouldn’t hurt her, so after more than half an hour of tearing endurance, she couldn’t bear the stench emanated from her skin anymore and rushed into the bathroom at a very quick speed.</p><p>“CREAK…”</p><p>The door of the study was opened again, Tang Han, after taking a shower, rubbed her stomach and came to Tang Xiu with a weird expression. Although she still felt a bit weak now, she could clearly feel that the weakness was caused by excreting the black matter from her body and having diarrhea for six times, instead of the effects of the Darkening Virus.</p><p>“Brother, I… I recovered.”</p><p>With eyes sparkling with light, Tang Han said cheerfully.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
