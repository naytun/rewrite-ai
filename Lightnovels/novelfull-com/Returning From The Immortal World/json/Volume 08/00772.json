The loss hurt her a lot.</p><p>Zhenlei Duomu clenched her fists and was to contact the subordinates in the encampment through the communication equipment. Original translation from Www。WangmamaRead。Com。Suddenly, she got a glimpse of the body of one of her subordinates’. A line of words was engraved on its forehead: Idiot, Fuck You.</p><p>“BOOM…”</p><p>Turning around, Zhenlei Duomu gave the big tree beside her a punch. At that moment, the tree, which could not be hugged by two men, was broken by her power, falling down and the dust flew.</p><p>“Miao Wenlei! Miao Hengfu!”</p><p>Sometimes, wisdom was more terrifying than force.</p><p>A few kilometers away, Ye Shisan took an infrared high-powered telescope and stared at the angry expression of Zhenlei Duomu. He had just joked with Xue Sha and said that Zhenlei Duomu would definitely fly into a rage after she saw the scene of the murder. But the result was that Zhenlei Duomu gave a towering old tree a punch.</p><p>“It couldn’t be a Talented Adept.”</p><p>“Couldn’t be a vampire, either.”</p><p>Ye Shisan said to Zidan who was also taking a telescope. Finished that, they two fell into silence at the same time for a long time until Zhenlei Duomu disappeared into the distance, Ye Shisan said in a deep voice, “The situation must be reported to the boss. The power of that woman is too strong, even we are no match for her. It will be very troublesome if something goes wrong in the plan.”</p><p>Zidan was always confident and prudent, after listening to what Ye Shisan said, he nodded and said, “Although we are not familiar with the actual strength of Miao Hengfu, he couldn’t be the match of Zhenlei Duomu if he is a common person. A powerful one can exterminate almost all common people once and for all.”</p><p>“Original translation from Www。WangmamaRead。Com。”</p><p>Ye Shisan said, “Our boss is aiming at eradicating the power of the Miao clan with the hand of Reston, the Mafia. You go to report on the woman’s information to our boss, and we will proceed to carry out the next plan at once.”</p><p>“OK.”</p><p>In Wolfpack City.</p><p>Being located in the center of the city, the Qingyuan Group occupied an extremely large area. Its five four-story buildings formed a circle, encompassing a three-story building in the middle. Between the three-story building and each of the five four-story buildings, there was an air corridor. The configuration of the buildings looked like five dragons holding a pearl.</p><p>The entire top floor of the three-story building was the private place of the president of the Qingyuan Group, Miao Hengfu, and it was off-limits to others, including the senior officials in his company. It was Miao Hengfu’s place for a recreational purpose. Its interior decoration was extraordinarily luxurious with a variety of recreational facilities. Many senior officials of the Qingyuan Group clearly knew it was the place where Miao Hengfu kept more than 10 beautiful women.</p><p>“When you are in good times, you should enjoy yourself to the fullest, and the golden cup should be filled with wine accompanied by the moonlight.”</p><p>Miao Hengfu especially praised this poem, and he enjoyed himself exceptionally. Laying on the soft sofa and enjoying the massage of beauty, he tasted the grapes passed by another beautiful woman. His facial expression showed how enjoyable he was.</p><p>“Dingding…”</p><p>Miao Hengfu’s mobile phone suddenly rang rapidly.</p><p>Miao Hengfu didn’t take it seriously, even without raising his eyelids. Instead, a beautiful lady cleverly brought over the phone, looking at the phone number on the display, she said, “It is an unknown number.”</p><p>“Pick it up.”</p><p>Miao Hengfu finally raised his eyelids and watched the beautiful lady picked up the phone. He was about to speak, while a rapid roar rang in the phone:</p><p>“Boss help us, damn the Reston Mafia. Ah…”</p><p>After the squeal, there was no more voice on the phone.</p><p>Miao Hengfu’s face changed greatly, and he suddenly jumped up from the sofa, walking downstairs solemnly, with his phone in hand. He entered the office on the second floor, two seniors of the company immediately followed him inside.</p><p>“This number, check who owns it.”</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>One of the seniors remembered the number and left the office. After one or two minutes, he rushed back and reported, “Boss, I’ve already checked it out. It’s the private number of a security guard of our company security team, who has been listed as a member of the Flame squad by you.”</p><p>Miao Hengfu asked in a deep voice, “Where is he now?”</p><p>The senior replied, “I just inquired about it. What I know is that… he went out with your son last night and has not returned yet.” Original translation from Www。WangmamaRead。Com。</p><p>Miao Hengfu looked dull, then his pupils contracted sharply, a horrified light burst from his eyes. He immediately took the phone and called his son Miao Wenlei. No one answered.</p><p>Something went wrong.</p><p>Miao Hengfu’s heart skipped a beat, bad feelings arose in his mind.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
