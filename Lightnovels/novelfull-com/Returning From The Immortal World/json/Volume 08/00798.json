If she wakes up in time and adjusts herself to this problem, she will be able to recover to like before after some time. But if she doesn’t, I’m afraid she won’t be able to continue cultivating in the future.”</p><p>Han Jintong’s heart thumped as a chill inside his heart madly emerged. He clearly realized what it meant for a cultivator not being able to cultivate. It was like losing the hope of having the ability to become stronger.</p><p>For cultivators who had been going through the bustle and hustle of their lives, going through such a mediocre life without any means to cultivate further was a fate worse than death. He didn’t know whether his granddaughter would be able to endure such an ending.</p><p>“Is there any other way to work around it?” asked Han Jintong quickly.</p><p>“It’s not like there’s no other way, actually,” Tang Xiu said lightly. “It’s just to manufacture the artifacts to alleviate a mental demon in a short time will need some heavenly materials and treasures. However, I don’t have these heavenly materials, at least not on Earth as they are nearly impossible to find here. I’ve done what I can. There’s nothing we can do but see whether she can pull herself out on her own now.”</p><p>In fact, there was another method that Tang Xiu didn’t mention as it was a situation with a one-in-a-million chance of success. That was to say, it was a situation where those possessed by their mental demon were able to sober up and even have an epiphany. The insights they obtained from the epiphany would fully remedy the price of the mental demon possession and they would even get some benefits from it.</p><p>That was, they must be able to overcome their mental demon, control it, and then destroy it.</p><p>Those who were able to overcome such a situation not only would be able to traverse further on their cultivation path but would also become more formidable.</p><p>“Awu, you are to stay here and not let anyone approach this place. Do notify me at once when Han Qingwu wakes up,” ordered Tang Xiu clearly before taking Ouyang Lulu to leave.</p><p>As they came to Ouyang Lulu’s residence, Tang Xiu straightly sat on the sofa with a headache. An unexpected situation happened to Han Qingwu and caught him by surprise. He originally thought that if Han Qingwu kept cultivating, she might be able to ascend and become an immortal. Even if she couldn’t fully recover the memory of her past life on Earth, she would definitely be able to restore it once she ascended to the Immortal World. At that time, he would be able to settle the account between them in the Immortal World.</p><p>However, if she were to forever halt at this stage, should he wait for her to enter Samsara and be reincarnated to step onto the cultivation path once again? Even if she did have the opportunity to break free from the bitter Sea of Samsara and be reincarnated as a human again, the chances of her restoring her past life’s memory was very minute.</p><p>Realizing that Tang Xiu was in a bad mood, Ouyang Lulu quietly sat down next to him. She even immediately changed the topic in an attempt to adjust his bad mood. “What did you do some time ago, Tang Xiu? You didn’t even attend such an important event like the tender that your Magnificent Tang Corp held a while ago? I really can’t figure out what Kang Xia had in mind either. Why would she hand over such a large project to a company that didn’t even complete the architectural blueprint design?”</p><p>The Senyuan Group?</p><p>Tang Xiu’s expression changed. He secretly admired the means and resourcefulness of Chen Zixue, even though he did tell Kang Xia previously to give the Senyuan Group the chance to participate in the tender if there were none more suitable than them. She was still the decision maker to give the final green light for the tender. She knew how to handle it much better than himself as she would never easily comply in favor of Chen Zixue because of his opinion.</p><p>“I had been busy to deal with some urgent and important issues recently, so didn’t have much time to pay attention to the company’s business. Kang Xia is very capable and she must have her reasons for choosing Senyuan Group. If anything, I also have met Chen Zixue, the Senyuan Group’s owner, and saw the unfinished design myself before I left. It was quite good.”</p><p>“I recently learned something about Chen Zixue and his Senyuan Group. This guy is indeed quite capable… though, he was quite ruthless sometimes,” said Ouyang Lulu. “He even dares to resort to many taboo means that are avoided by the business community to get what he wants.”</p><p>“Not really. It’s just a natural selection—a survival of the fittest,” Tang Xiu shook his head and said, “Some people say that the market itself is but a battlefield; the field of contest where either we or our enemies die. The means are never important, only the ending and its outcome. In order to become the winner and survive to see another day, why should people fear schemes and intrigues? Why fear being seen as shameless and cruel? As long as you have enough strength and keep getting stronger, all problems are no longer an issue.”</p><p>“Your argument is just lame and logically warped, you know,” rebuked Ouyang Lulu discontentedly.</p><p>“Hahaha.” Tang Xiu couldn’t help but laugh and said, “How come this argument is logically warped? Take the analogy for the struggle for imperial authority for instance. The final winners who sit on the throne, which one of them have hands not stained by blood and who have not trampled on heaps of countless people and bones to sit there? There are a lot of other examples; the outcome is what matters rather than the process. Now I ask you, how does Senyuan Group compare to its previous state 10 years ago?”</p><p>“It’s numerous times stronger,” answered Ouyang Lulu.</p><p>“Isn’t it just natural?” Tang Xiu nodded and continued, “Every successful person will have many enemies, yet you can see for yourself that Senyuan Group is still getting stronger and Chen Zixue is getting wealthier as well, right?”</p><p>Ouyang Lulu had nothing to retort. She could tell that Tang Xiu’s argument was justifiable, yet it was still difficult for her to accept it. She was not some pure, innocent individual herself for she also opened a casino in Jingmen Island, indicating that she also had some crazy side in her. However, opening a casino was just going in the same direction to some shady, illegal dealings—a pure underworld business, so to say. But Senyuan Group was a proper business on the surface, yet the operator actually resorted to many foul means, much to her disgust.</p><p>Arguing with Tang Xiu made Ouyang Lulu disinclined to continue the topic. She got up to make some tea and served a pot of it in front of Tang Xiu, then said, “Anyways, that old Mo Yi has been kinda acting weird recently. Are you going to see him? As it seems like Shanjenna is nearly unable to stand it.”</p><p>Tang Xiu looked dull for a moment and immediately remembered the research topic being studied by Mo Yi. He then immediately asked, “What exactly happened? Did the research run into a bottleneck or something?”</p><p>“Yup. It’s a very serious bottleneck, no less.” Ouyang Lulu laughed and said, “I heard Shanjenna complaining, you know. If she didn’t anticipate the medicinal pill reward from you, she would’ve probably resigned and wouldn’t give her blood again.”</p><p>“Pfft…”</p><p>Ouyang Lulu’s last sentence instantly shattered the depressive mood Tang Xiu had. He couldn’t help but laugh after hearing it. He took and drank his cup of tea, got up and then said, “Alright, let’s go see Profession Mo and Shanjenna then!”</p><p>10 minutes later, Tang Xiu met Mo Yi. The old man wore a white lab coat with his myopia glasses and was currently busying himself with tons of research instruments around him. Shanjenna, however, was sitting listlessly on a sofa near the door, drowning in drowsiness.</p><p>“Gimme a half-tube of your fresh blood again, Shanjenna. I’m probably heading in the right direction…” Mo Yi suddenly spoke without looking up.</p><p>Shanjenna’s face changed. She immediately jumped up from the sofa and angrily roared, “YOU WHAT? You’re a fucking asshole, Mo Yi! I heard those fucking words 20 times already. But what’s the result? Do tell me what result you get, huh? The blood of my Bloodkin is very precious and we’ll need a long time to recover every drop of blood we drop! But you… you, you… you’ve taken more than 20 half-tubes of my blood recently, bastard!”</p><p>Mo Yi frowned and turned around. Only as his eyes fell on Shanjenna did he realize that some people were calmly standing behind her smiling. It was Tang Xiu and Ouyang Lulu standing there without a word.</p><p>“Ah, you came, Tang Xiu!” Mo Yi was pleasantly surprised and put down his things before coming over.</p><p>Hearing that, Shanjenna similarly turned around to look towards the back. She immediately sprinted to the front of Tang Xiu when she saw him, wearing a wronged expression as she complained, “Please save me, Mr. Tang! This old thing has been treating me so badly! He has no skills whatsoever, not even producing an ounce of any drugs from his research, yet he forces me to pump out my blood every day. I will turn into a human if this keeps going.”</p><p>Tang Xiu couldn’t help but laugh and he gently patted her shoulder. He then took out a porcelain vase from his interspatial ring and spoke to Shanjenna while handing it over, “Alright, this is a medicinal pill I just concocted recently. Take it and you should benefit from it. Don’t rush to take it now, though. Wait until the evening break.”</p><p>“Great!”</p><p>Shanjenna was full of joy and excitedly fiddled with the porcelain vase. She couldn’t wait to immediately unplug the cork and pour the medicinal pills inside into her mouth.</p><p>Tang Xu then turned to look at Mo Yi and smilingly said, “Are you encountering some problems, Professor Mo?”</p><p>“Um, yeah!” Mo Yi forced a smile and replied, “The Bloodkin’s blood is kinda too active. I still can’t figure out a suitable substitute substance compatible with it!”</p><p>Tang Xiu thought it over and said, “Do you think it can be substituted by some herbs?”</p><p>Mo Yi looked dull for a moment before shaking his head. “I dunno. Even if there are any, I know nothing about medicinal herbs!”</p><p>Mulling it over for a while, Tang Xiu suddenly took out his mobile and dialed a cell number. After his call rang seven times, his call was picked up and an old, hoarse voice spoke, “Is there something you want, Tang Xiu?”</p><p>“Senior, I have something that I don’t know whether you’re interested in,” said Tang Xiu with a smile. “I’m kind of researching some medicine which I think will bring about a huge contribution to human life once it’s successful.”</p><p>“Not interested,” said Gui Jianchou. “Even if I do, I don’t have the time for it. Besides, I found interesting stuff myself and need some time to study it.”</p><p>“What interesting stuff, exactly?” asked Tang Xiu quickly.</p><p>Gui Jianchou was silent for a moment before he slowly replied, “Do you know that there are some other living beings other than humans and animals in this world?”</p><p>“I know some,” replied Tang Xiu.</p><p>“Do you really know some?” asked Gui Jianchou, surprised.</p><p>“I do know some,” answered Tang Xiu.</p><p>Gui Jianchou spoke again, “Alright, then I’ll tell you since you know some. I recently found some arm remains in Mist Source Island. That arm remains is kind of similar to human’s, but it’s covered with golden hair. After I did some analysis and diagnostics to measure the degree of its hardness and blood coagulation, I found something very unusual with this thing.”</p><p>“I think I know the arm remains you just obtained. It should be an arm from a half-beastman, a Demihuman. I think you should give up researching it and join my research, though,” said Tang Xiu. “It’s just that the subject of my research is kind of related to some strange breed of a race so to say.”</p><p>“Care to elaborate?” Gui Jianchou’s interest piqued and he inquired more. “I’ll agree to join you if it interests me.”</p><p>“Well, I have a friend here.” Tang Xiu glanced at Shanjenna and said with a pale smile, “She’s a member of Bloodkin, well known as vampires by ordinary people. My researchers here are currently researching medicine using her blood.”</p><p>“A VAMPIRE?” Gui Jianchou’s scream was heard from the cell phone.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
