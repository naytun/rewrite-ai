As Yang Chuxiong came rushing in, the two men entered a meeting room.</p><p>“The first leader has agreed to your plan, Mr. Tang. The country is now gathering a lot of jade and will send them to Mist Source Island shortly.” Yang Chuxiong looked very excited since the entirety of Mist Source Island would become an impregnable bastion once the geomancy array has been laid out. He would no longer have to worry about the problem of outsiders sneaking inside.</p><p>“How long would it take, exactly?” Asked Tang Xiu.</p><p>“According to my superiors, a batch of jade stored in the country stockpile can be shipped right away, but the quantity is only about five tons,” replied Yang Chuxiong. “If it’s not enough, you’ll have more jade that can be sent over, but the higher-ups don’t know how much you need and they wanted me to ask you about that.”</p><p>Five tons?</p><p>Tang Xiu’s mouth twitched a few times and he felt excited inside. One must know that only one ton of jade was needed to lay out an array that covered the entirety of Mist Source Island. Yet, the country would send five tons of jade in the first shipment batch. Wasn’t it giving him a chance to embezzle the rest?</p><p>‘I just struck gold!’</p><p>As excited as he might be, Tang Xiu’s expression didn’t show any ripples on the surface. Instead, he deliberately frowned, slowly shook his head, and said, “Five tons of jade won’t be enough. You also know that Mist Source Island has a very large area and a massive number of jades would be needed. I would at least need around 15 tons!”</p><p>Yang Chuxiong fell into thoughts for a moment before he nodded and said, “15 tons of jade is not a massive number. The quantity of jades produced by the jade mines in our country is a lot more than that, but most of them are under control of private owners, so the country needs some time to buy them. Just wait for a bit! All the jades will be collected and they should be shipped in ten and a half days.”</p><p>“Alright then,” Tang Xiu nodded, satisfied.</p><p>Tang Xiu then had dinner with Yang Chuxiong. When Divine Doctor Gui Jianchou found out that Tang Xiu had returned to the military base, he rushed to meet him and they had a drink together. Tang Xiu also gifted him two boxes of God’s Nectar when he was about to leave the military base, causing the old man to praise his thoughtfulness.</p><p>Similarly, Yang Chuxiong got the same gift as he was also given two boxes of God’s Nectar. Certainly, the gift was not given without a price. Tang Xiu composed some lies to make Yang Chuxiong grant an army entry pass for Tang Han so she would be able to come and go out of the island freely once the geomancy array has been arranged.</p><p>Late at night.</p><p>Tang Xiu was sitting cross-legged in cultivation when a knock came at the door and Mo Awu’s voice rang from the outside, “Boss, someone is coming from the mainland. It’s your lady, Boss—Mu Wanying.”</p><p>Uh, Boss’s wife?</p><p>Tang Xiu forced a smile inside. He opened the door and asked, “Where is she now?”</p><p>“Jin Shi is escorting her into the army compound. They are on the way here and should be arriving in a few minutes,” said Mo Awu.</p><p>Tang Xiu nodded and went back to the room to put on his coat. Right as he came to the entrance of the two-story building, he saw Mu Wanying with four middle-aged men and women get out from two military jeeps and follow behind Jin Shi.</p><p>“Tang Xiu.”</p><p>Seeing Tang Xiu made Mu Wanying very excited. Tang Xiu introduced her to a lot of business partners recently, making her so busy that she was simply overwhelmed. She only had contact with Tang Xiu via several phone calls during this time.</p><p>“Alright, rest well tonight. It’s been quite wearing on you.” Tang Xiu smiled and said, “I’ll escort you to Qingyuan Group tomorrow.”</p><p>Gently nodding, Mu Wanying came to Tang Xiu’s side and restrained her urge to hug him, but still grabbed his arm and affectionately said, “I miss you. I really miss you so much.”</p><p>Tang Xiu smiled in response and gently stroked her shoulders. He turned back to the small building and ordered Mo Awu to contact the management staff to arrange accommodations for the four people Mu Wanying brought with her. He then took her to the second floor.</p><p>“Is it your first time visiting this place?” asked Tang Xiu as he entered the room and took off his coat.</p><p>“Yeah, it’s my first time,” Mu Wanying nodded. “I heard about this place from my Dad several times, but I never thought the scenery would be so beautiful. If I didn’t have tons of things to do outside, I really would wish to stay here for some time.”</p><p>“This place does have an excellent environment; at least the air here is much better than Shanghai’s” Tang Xiu smilingly replied, “If you like this place, why don’t you buy real estate here? You can take a vacation and relax whenever you want later.”</p><p>“Umm… but you must accompany me,” replied Mu Wanying with a smile.</p><p>Tang Xiu couldn’t help but laugh and said, “I will if I have some time later.”</p><p>The duo then conversed about some recent events. Eventually, Mu Wanying said with concern on her face, “You know, my Dad is quite angry after he heard the situation with the Qingyuan Group. Especially when he learned that you were the one who dealt with the problem.”</p><p>“So, what do you think, then?” Tang Xiu smilingly asked.</p><p>“If you ask me, I understand your idea,” Mu Wanying smiled back and said, “I know that my father has been unreasonable these years. Since I have 25% of the Qingyuan Group’s shares, it means his profits are reliant on me. You can relax about that! Dad won’t dare to voice anything about you if he needs the money in the future!”</p><p>Tang Xiu couldn’t help but burst out in laughter after hearing that and said, “Your Dad would really be choked up in anger if he were to find out what you have in mind, you know. I’m absolutely sure that he will think—a grown-up, married daughter really can’t be kept at home anymore… hahaha.”</p><p>Mu Wanying seemed a bit shy but still replied, “In any case, he can’t take back a married daughter. I won’t forget to be filial to him, but I can no longer indulge his temper anymore. Mom has been upset and has suffered a lot of injustice because of him all these years. No way I’ll let him wrong you as well.”</p><p>“Having a girlfriend like you is really a great thing to have,” interjected Tang Xiu with a smile.</p><p>Mu Wanying used to be very reserved; along with her indifference toward fame and wealth, she looked like a gentle and virtuous lady, like an otherworldly female celestial. But at this moment, an inexplicable impulse inside her drove her to say, “Marry me earlier if you’re really happy with me, then.”</p><p>“Ugh…”</p><p>Tang Xiu was rendered speechless for a long time. He couldn’t verbalize anything and just let out a hollow laugh for a while, and then said, “We are still young; even we have yet to enter the legal marriage age. Besides, we are still students. Let’s just wait until we’ve graduated from the university…”</p><p>“Let’s get married after graduation, then,” said Mu Wanying softly.</p><p>Tang Xiu could only sigh inwardly, yet he let out a smile on his face and said, “No problem.”</p><p>Tonight, Mu Wanying spent the night in Tang Xiu’s room, while Tang Xiu himself spent the whole night cultivating. As the next day came, he was still in high spirits as he escorted Mu Wanying to the Qingyuan Group and dealt with the company shares. After everything was done, he sent her off and then returned back to the military base.</p><p>After waiting for two days, five tons of high-quality jade was shipped. Tang Xiu’s eyes were glowing when he saw these jades. He had attended the jade meeting event in Star City and had gambled on stones there, even spending quite a lot of money to buy jades. But he had just run his mouth and took a gamble, yet the number of jades he obtained was more than a hundred times greater. Such a refreshing feeling made his mood sky high.</p><p>“How are these jades, Mr. Tang?” asked Yang Chuxiong, who accompanied Tang Xiu to the side as they viewed the jades inside the truck’s container.</p><p>“The quality is very good,” Tang Xiu nodded with a satisfied look. “They won’t produce any issues using them for the array. However, I’d like Division Commander Yang to send the next batches of jades earlier so that I can lay out the Feng Shui Array as soon as possible and go back quickly too.”</p><p>“You can rest assured about that!” Yang Chuxiong said, “It’s an order from First Leader, so no one dares to delay it by a bit. Also, I just received the message that the next batch of jades will all be shipped to Mist Source Island within five days. What about you? When will you start laying out the Feng Shui array?”</p><p>“I’ll need a couple of days to inspect the surrounding terrain of Mist Source Island and then I can begin the work immediately,” answered Tang Xiu. “I will bury these jades in some specific positions. If the next batch of jades can be shipped within five days, I can finish the Feng Shui array arrangement in up to half a month.”</p><p>“No problem, then!” replied Yang Chuxiong with excitement.</p><p>Time fleeted by and a week passed in the blink of an eye. Tang Xiu had collected a total of 15 tons of good quality jades. After inspecting the location, he finally determined that it would only need less than one ton of jade to lay out the Feng Shui array here. Thus, he could pocket the remaining 14 tons for himself.</p><p>Laying out a huge Feng Shui array that covered the entirety of Mist Source Island was definitely not a small project. But with the help of Mo Awu and the others, Tang Xiu was able to arrange it faster as they were able to lay out and bury the jades inside the 16 important foundations that took root around Mist Source Island.</p><p>“Boss, the Mist Source Island’s authorities just called and they want to see you. Also, there are some reporters from the TV station here wanting to interview you. How should I reply to them?” asked Mo Awu in a whisper as he came to Tang Xiu’s side.</p><p>While gazing at the white mist in the distance, Tang Xiu replied without hesitation, “Turn down all of them. Tell them that I’m very busy handling important things and that I have no time for interviews or seeing them. If they want to know anything about the project, tell them to contact Yang Chuxiong.”</p><p>Mo Awu received the order, took the communicator, and left.</p><p>Time passed quickly again. When all the jades had been delivered on the 13th day, Tang Xiu arranged the entire geomancy array in an array called the Ring Chain Feng Shui array. The array was capable of both defensive and offensive features.</p><p>In the southern coastline of Mist Source Island.</p><p>Thousands of soldiers had blocked all areas within a dozen kilometers so that no one could leave or enter Mist Source Island. The island was fully blockaded for the time being.</p><p>Yang Chuxiong stood beside Tang Xiu while gazing at the two 18-meters-high pillars. His heart was actually filled with confusion and he wanted to ask Tang Xiu several times as to why these two pillars were arranged here. But when he saw Tang Xiu’s solemn expression, he understood that it was inappropriate to disturb him.</p><p>“It’s almost time.”</p><p>Tang Xiu, who looked at the setting sun from the West where the billowing white mist surged in the distance, finally turned to Yang Chuxiong and spoke to the man.</p><p>“What’s almost time?” Asked Yang Chuxiong, looking confused.</p><p>“It’s almost time to witness the miracle,” Tang Xiu smiled and said, “Division Commander Yang, order your soldiers to evacuate the area and move back five kilometers.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
