Even though he already finished learning all the contents and knowledge in the books, Han Qingwu did not want to see him skip classes, while he also did not want to haggle over this matter with her.</p><p>As the last class’ bell rang, Yue Kai, who sat next to Tang Xiu, came over and whispered, “Do you have any plans tonight? If not, how about joining us bowling?”</p><p>Tang Xiu himself already had a plan in mind, so he shook his head and said, “There’s something I gotta do tonight, so I’m afraid I can’t join you. Let’s change it to some other day when I’m not too busy! I’ll treat you brothers to a meal later.”</p><p>Having learned about Tang Xiu’s identity as well as his busy schedule in managing his business, Yue Kai nodded and said, “Okay. But be very careful when you go out. Shanghai has not been tranquil and peaceful recently, and there had been several homicide cases in just a few days. You’re a Big Boss, so you should take some bodyguards with you.”</p><p>Several homicide cases?</p><p>Tang Xiu was surprised and asked, “What murders? I only heard about the one where four nightclub girls were killed.”</p><p>“The murdered nightclub girls’ case is only one of them. Two more murder cases occurred in Fanyu District and Jingning District. I heard that even a cop was killed, and the culprit must be the one who did it. You see, the police are now employing a very strict blockade. I wouldn’t have known about this if my old man hadn’t called me and told me to pay attention to safety when I go out of the campus.”</p><p>Tang Xiu nodded and thought that the other two murder cases should not be extraordinary events, else the Everlasting Feast Hall’s intelligence personnel would have informed him.</p><p>After the teacher left, Tang Xiu handed over his textbooks to Yue Kai to bring them back while he walked toward the outside of the classroom building alone. He had not bought the research instruments needed by Professor Mo Yi, and Tang Xiu still wanted to know about the past happenings here previously.</p><p>Honk, honk…</p><p>A red BMW slowly stopped by Tang Xiu’s side. As the door was opened, Han Qingwu got off and walked toward Tang Xiu. Her walking posture looked somewhat unusual, and there was a bloodstain on her white neck.</p><p>“Do you have time tonight? Let’s have dinner together.”</p><p>Tang Xiu slightly knitted his brows and did not  immediately reply, but observed her before saying, “Are you injured?”</p><p>“It’s nothing. I was slightly injured during the training,” said Han Qingwu without thinking.</p><p>Tang Xiu nodded and asked again, “Is there something up?”</p><p>“I want to speak to you about something,” said Han Qingwu. “Anyways, let’s walk and find a place to eat, and then we’ll talk about that while having a bite.”</p><p>Tang Xiu did not refuse and sat in the front seat. The red BMW started moving and left the Shanghai University quickly. While sitting on the front seat, Tang Xiu looked at Han Qingwu’s face from the side and suddenly said, “Let’s eat in the Paradise Manor! Your Grandpa is also there.”</p><p>Han Qingwu was stunned for a moment, and then immediately asked, “How could my Grandpa be in the Paradise Manor? And how do you know that?”</p><p>“He was injured and now is healing his wounds there,” said Tang Xiu. “He might tell you the cause when you get there.”</p><p>Han Qingwu knew Tang Xiu’s character, and if this guy did not want to say it, then she would never get the answer even if she insisted and forced him to. When they arrived at the Paradise Manor, Tang Xiu directly led Han Qingwu to the foreign-styled building where Han Jintong was staying, and then found only Shanjenna, who was currently watching TV in the living room.</p><p>“Where are Professor Mo and Han Jintong?” Asked Tang Xiu.</p><p>Shanjenna jumped up and after approaching, she respectfully answered, “Professor Mo is currently sorting out the data and documents in the other room, whereas teacher is currently healing himself, Mr. Tang. Anyways, thanks for giving him the Holy Healing medicine. His injuries are already better, and Teacher said that he will be fully healed in 2-3 days at most.”</p><p>“Go call him! Tell him that his granddaughter is here,” said Tang Xiu.</p><p>At this time, Han Jintong walked out of the room into the hallway and he immediately looked surprised after seeing Han Qingwu, saying, “Little Wu, why are you here?”</p><p>Han Qingwu, who already knew that her Grandpa was injured, strode toward Han Jintong and asked with a concerned expression all over her face, “I heard from Tang Xiu that you were injured, Grandpa. How is your injury now? What exactly happened and who did it?”</p><p>Han Jintong looked at Tang Xiu and immediately said with a smile, “Don’t worry, my injuries are about to heal, so it’s no big deal. Anyways, about what happened, it’s quite a complicated matter. I’ll tell you about that later. That’s right. This is Shanjenna, my student in the Yale University when I was teaching there.”</p><p>“Hi, Qingwu. I’m Shanjenna, and I’m very pleased to meet you.” Shanjenna stretched her hand out and said with a smile. “Anyways, Professor often mentioned you when I was in the United States.”</p><p>Han Qingwu shook hands with her and said, “Hi, Shanjenna. Anyways, my Granddad doesn’t want to tell me what exactly happened, could you tell me about that?”</p><p>Shanjenna glanced at Han Jintong and Tang Xiu. After seeing the calm expression on their faces and as they did not try to prevent her, she immediately said with an apologetic expression, “In fact, it was because of me that Professor got injured. I’m a member of the Bloodkin and was being hunted, so I ran away to China. I knew that he lived here, so I asked for his help and hoped that he could give me a safe place to hide. I never thought that those assassination agents had used the Darksoul Scent on me, the type of agent with a strong tracking effect. As a result, they always knew my whereabouts, while the professor also did not want to leave me alone, hence the reason why we all got injured.”</p><p>“What organization is this Bloodkin?” Only recently did Han Qingwu learn about some huge international organizations, but she had never heard of this organization.</p><p>“The Bloodkin is not an organization, but the collective name for a race,” explained Shanjenna. “And members of Bloodkin turn into what you call vampire.”</p><p>With that said, she spread out her wings and revealed her fangs. She then continued explaining while releasing her huge aura, “You should have watched the TV about us. And those vampires aired there are of our Bloodkin. But then again, there are some differences between those on TV with us, nonetheless.”</p><p>A shocked expression could be seen on Han Qingwu’s face, though she did not look as scared as Mo Yi was. Upon sensing that huge aura that came pressing from the front, she also unleashed a similar huge aura that surged toward Shanjenna.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>Han Jintong, who stood at the side, could feel the huge aura from Shanjenna and Han Qingwu. A disbelieving expression painted his old face, while his eyeballs stared so wide that they almost dropped. Shanjenna was very powerful, that he knew. But… but when did his baby granddaughter become such a powerhouse?</p><p>“Alright, stop!”</p><p>Tang Xiu glanced at them and then went to the sofa to take a seat, saying, “I never thought that you were already so powerful in such a short time, Han Qingwu. You should have reached the Peak of the Qi Refining Stage, right? You may soon be able to contend with Shanjenna if you keep maintaining this progress rate.”</p><p>“No, I’m still weak.” Han Qingwu shook her head. “Some martial arts grandmasters may able to defeat me if I don’t use True Essence to fight them. I learned some martial arts skills from your men, but those moves are not suitable for me, because they are specifically used for killing.”</p><p>Finally, Han Jintong could not bear it anymore and walked toward Han Qingwu and asked excitedly, “Little Wu, you… you have become a cultivator too?”</p><p>“I only practice a set of cultivation technique, Grandpa.” Han Qingwu nodded. “While my strength and speed have indeed improved a lot, but I’m not good at the rest.”</p><p>Han Jintong’s old face was full of excitement, nonetheless. He thought that it was Tang Xiu who taught his granddaughter a cultivation technique, so he spoke to him gratefully, “Thank you for teaching a cultivation technique to my granddaughter, Mr. Tang. The grace you have bestowed upon the Han Family is greater than the Heavens!”</p><p>“What benevolence?” Asked Han Qingwu, confused.</p><p>Han Jintong quickly said, “Little Wu, Shanjenna and I were originally being hunted down by the enemies and were in a hopeless situation. If it wasn’t for Mr. Tang who suddenly came to save us, I’m afraid that we would be dead already by now. So, he’s my savior.”</p><p>Han Qingwu did not expect that there was such a hidden story at all. Just as she was about to express her gratitude, Tang Xiu did not give her the opportunity as he already got up and said, “Alright, you all continue chatting, I’m going to arrange for the dinner.”</p><p>At the door, Mo Awu, who just came over and saw Tang Xiu coming out, quickly said, “Boss, Chi Nan called and said there’s someone from Changxi City who wants to see you. His name is Ji Mu and he’s in Shanghai now. However, Chi Nan did not dare to decide anything without your permission, so she called me to ask you about this.”</p><p>Ji Mu?</p><p>Tang Xiu remembered this guy, who he got acquainted with previously when he participated in the car race on the Laoshan Highway. After giving it a thought, he then nodded and said, “Alright, tell Chi Nan to let that Ji Mu guy come to the Paradise Manor!”</p><p>“Understood!” Mo Awu replied and immediately walked away.</p><p>At this time, Han Qingwu walked out of the room and saw Tang Xiu lighting a cigarette. She then came over and spoke, “Tang Xiu, thank you.”</p><p>“It’s nothing,” said Tang Xiu calmly.</p><p>Han Qingwu fell silent for more than ten seconds. Then, she seemed to have decided something and said, “Do you have time the day after tomorrow? Care to accompany me to a certain place?”</p><p>“Is this the true purpose you wanted to find me today?” Asked Tang Xiu.</p><p>“Yes.” Han Qingwu nodded.</p><p>“Where to?” Asked Tang Xiu.</p><p>“The day after tomorrow is the finals of the national underground fighting competition. At that time, there will be a lot of Kung Fu masters and even a few at the grandmaster level. One of them is called Li Tong, who is only about 40 years old but has reached the grandmaster level in just about 5 or 6 years ago. His style is very cunning, cruel and vicious at the same time. 60% of those who were defeated by him in the past were killed, 30% turned into disabled, and only 10% who quickly admitted defeat escaped the predicament.</p><p>“I know that my strength is very strong at present, but I’m lacking the confidence when facing a true life and death combat. So, I want you to accompany me there.</p><p>“Would you go with me?”</p><p>Tang Xiu frowned and said, “When did you start participating in the underground fighting?”</p><p>“It’s been two months already,” said Han Qingwu, biting her lips.</p><p>Tang Xiu secretly sighed. He did not expect that Han Qingwu would be this stubborn as she actually took the risk of participating in the underground fighting just because she wanted to become stronger. He heard of the underground fighting, where those who participate must sign a life and death contract, that whether they would live or die in the ring would fully rely on their own strength.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
