He then nodded casually and smilingly said, “Lending a hand to bring a romance to a happy ending is something that I’m naturally willing to do. Nevermind about it, I wish you to have a good life in the future.”</p><p>At this time, Ji Mu also came to the second floor. Changxi may be his turf, but after he stood before Tang Xiu, he still said with a respectful expression, “I was enlightened by what you just said, Brother Tang. I didn’t know you were visiting Changxi, so I neglected my part as a good host to entertain you well. I apologize for that.”</p><p>“If anything, I’m just here for personal matters, so there’s no need for being overly formal.” Tang Xiu waved his hand. “Anyhow, you already accepted your wife to be and will soon bear your child too, so you had better take her home to have a rest.”</p><p>“How could I do that, Brother Tang? You just came and as a host, I should entertain you well. Also, if you are going to stay in Changxi for a few days, I’ll immediately book a hotel for you. Or you can opt to stay in my villa here if you don’t want to. I have an unoccupied villa here, so you can stay there any time you want.”</p><p>Everyone around was immediately struck dumb after hearing him, and even his best buddies were dumbfounded and speechless as though they could hardly believe what they heard.</p><p>Even Yu Hong herself was stunned at this time. Though she knew that her good sister Han Qingwu had an unrequited crush on her own student, she also knew that this very student had quite the abilities as he just started his own business and set up a company. But she did not know about anything else other than that.</p><p>But now, it seemed that Tang Xiu was way too good to be true, right? To think that even the scion of the Ji Family of Changxi had to put on such a respectful attitude before him. How was this possible?</p><p>Is it possible that… this Tang Xiu has a very honorable identity or something? Could it be that his influence is much more powerful than his Ji Family?</p><p>At the same time, Ren Ranran was also stunned, as she could tell from Ji Mu’s words that not only he knew this young man who helped her, but also was very respectful towards him. She knew Ji Mu perfectly well, and there was no young man in the entire Changxi who could make this guy act this respectful, neither in the whole province and only very few in the whole country.</p><p>Who can this benefactor be? From where this honorable being comes from that can make Ji Mu respect him so much?</p><p>Glancing at everyone's shocked expressions, Tang Xiu helplessly said, “Your woman is pregnant, Ji Mu, and she just went through such an emotional experience. You had better take her back to rest well so as to avoid a miscarriage. Besides, I came here with a friend to deal with a personal issue, so I’ll return back to Shanghai this evening. There’s no need to trouble you about it while I’m here.”</p><p>Looking at Ren Ranran’s belly, Ji Mu hesitated a bit and then said, “Alright, I’ll escort her back first, and come over again to accompany you after she’s settled. Brother Tang, I’m a Changxi local—a king here you may say, so I can help you deal with things here if you encounter any minor problem.”</p><p>“Are you some kind of dogskin plaster or something?” Grunted Tang Xiu. After saying that, however, he felt that his actions seemed not to give Ji Mu face, so he continued, “But since you got nothing to do, then fine. Come over again later!”</p><p>“Sure thing!” Ji Mu was actually a bit embarrassed, but the following sentence from Tang Xiu immediately made him happy. He then grabbed Ren Ranran and went downstairs.</p><p>Tang Xiu’s gaze followed the duo’s back as they left, and suddenly spoke, “Hey, do remember to notify me when you get married. I’ll prepare some great gifts.”</p><p>JI Mu’s pace halted and his heartbeat sped up. He immediately turned around to express his thanks with a serious expression and then left with Ren Ranran, who looked confused.</p><p>After the noisy event, everyone in the entire restaurant now knew that Tang Xiu was some kind of a great celestial being seeing as even the young master of the Ji Family acted that respectful toward him. Nobody dared to come over to hit a conversation with him. They measured and asked themselves: Do I have enough qualifications?</p><p>At this moment, Yu Hong gaped her mouth so wide that even a duck egg could fit in. The shocked expression on her face lasted for a few minutes, as she then snapped back to her senses like being awakened from a dream. She gulped down and glanced at Han Qingwu, who was still eating. While still being overwhelmed with uneasiness, she asked, “T-Tang… Tang Xiu, exactly which honorable person are you? Ji Mu… he’s a proud man to the bones, but how can he act like a grandson before you?”</p><p>Tang Xiu rolled his eyes at her and snappily said with a smile, “Hey! You’re an adult belle, yet your mouth kind of runs loose, no? I have yet to get married and have a wife, and neither do I have any sons. How could I possibly have a grandson, huh? I told you I met Ji Mu a couple of times and we’re just friends!”</p><p>Yu Hong pouted and wore an expression that she did not buy his explanation in the slightest.</p><p>Han Qingwu suddenly raised her head and looked at Yu Hong, saying, “Honghong, just hurry and eat your meal, will you? The dishes have been served for quite a while and it will be cold if you don’t eat them now.”</p><p>“Okay. I’ll eat!”</p><p>Seeing that Tang Xiu did not want to entertain her, Yu Hong suppressed the resentful yet doubtful feeling she had deep down.</p><p>Below the restaurant.</p><p>Ji Mu sat in the driver seat on his Ferrari. After starting the car, he then drove it away. But Ren Ranran, who sat in the passenger seat, still looked confused, though she was very happy inside. She then asked, “Ji Mu, that Tang… exactly who is this Mr. Tang? You seem to… to value him very much?”</p><p>Ji Mu glanced at her and then said slowly, “He has a very special identity that I can’t tell you now. But you must remember something. Later on, you can annoy anyone in the world, but never once must you provoke him.”</p><p>“Is he really powerful?” Ren Ranran was astounded.</p><p>The smile on Ji Mu’s force was a bit forced as he sighed, “Far more than powerful. Eradicating both our Ji and Ren Families is even easier than killing an ant for him.”</p><p>“This…” Ren Ranran was completely shaken. She had heard a lot about powerful figures, but never once had she heard of anyone who could easily destroy the Ji and Ren Families. Granted that… even if he was a scion of the most powerful clan in the capital, there was no way it was an achievable feat, no?</p><p>However, she too felt that Ji Mu was unlikely to speak out such big words either. Hence, what exactly was all this about?</p><p>Ji Mu seemed to realize what she had in mind and gave a longer explanation, “There are many people in the world who we can’t afford to annoy, Ranran. What I told you is the truth! When I described how powerful he is, that’s the lowest estimation that disparages his power already. You also know about those prominent clans in the capital, don’t you? Even those genuine powerful families are nothing but ants in his eyes. Do remember my words, do not look at him with normal eyes, and you must be respectful in front of him. Even if he wants to kill us, we must be the ones who take the initiative to give it on our own.”</p><p>Hiss… Ren Ranran gasped and felt a chill down her spine.</p><p>Ji Mu still felt that his explanation was still not enough and gave a simple summary, “Just forget it, I’ll tell you more. He’s the secret Big Boss of the Magnificent Tang Corporation, and also a junior of the Tang Family of Beijing. But everything he has is little to nothing related to the Tang Family. The horrifying power he holds is not something even one hundred Tang Families added up can be compared with.”</p><p>“Aren’t you describing a God?” Ren Ranran’s lips were quivering as she interjected.</p><p>Ji Mu suddenly felt that Ren Ranran’s description was quite correct because, in his eyes, Tang Xiu was a definition of what a God was like; the sort who was far removed from the masses and reality, an abnormally dreadful demon god.</p><p>“That’s also one way to describe him.”</p><p>Now, Ren Ranran was completely shaken. After a long while, she came back to her senses and said, “Anyways, I just saw Yu Hong there, and she seems to know Mr. Tang.”</p><p>Ji Mu stared for a moment as a pondering look immediately appeared on his face. After half a minute, only then did he slowly speak, “There will be some opportunities in the future, so try to get closer to Yu Hong. Also, speak with the elders in your family to maintain a good relationship with the Yu Family in the future.”</p><p>As a very smart person, Ren Ranran immediately caught Ji Mu’s meaning.</p><p>After the Ferrari ran past the road quite far, Ji Mu spoke in a low voice, “Ranran, we have known each other for a very long time, thus we both know our own roots and also each other’s characters. I will naturally take the responsibility since you are now carrying my child. But then again, I can’t just take this feeling half-heartedly, so I want us to get along well together in the future. I’m sure I can nurture this feeling slowly, so let’s get engaged first. We’ll continue discussing about the marriage after the elders of our families have decided the engagement date.”</p><p>“Alright, I’ll listen to you.”</p><p>Ren Ranran reluctantly released her grip on his hand and nodded with delight.</p><p>Time flew by.</p><p>Tang Xiu, Han Qingwu, and Yu Hong did not rush to leave after having lunch, but let the waiter clean up the table, and then asked for a pot of tea while waiting for Ji Mu to come back.</p><p>During this time, Tang Xiu did not talk much and only listened quietly to Yu Hong and Han Qingwu’s conversation about some funny things they came across in life. At 14:30, Ji Mu finally rushed back.</p><p>“Anyways, we’ll attend to our things at eight tonight, so we got nothing to do this afternoon. Do you a recommendation?” Asked Tang Xiu.</p><p>“Are you, by chance, going to watch the fights in the underground fighting arena, Brother Tang?” Asked Ji Mu, surprised.</p><p>“Eh, you know about it?” Asked Tang Xiu again.</p><p>“The underground fighting competition’s final is going to be held in Changxi, so I naturally know about it,” said Ji Mu with a smile. “I originally did not have time for that tonight because I already agreed to hang out with my buddies and watch the match together.”</p><p>“Alright then. Let’s go together!” Tang Xiu nodded. “Now, let’s see to our schedule this afternoon.”</p><p>Ji Mu thought for a moment, and then asked, “How about going to the Red Pavilion? We can have tea and also watch the theatrical play over there. If you want to watch a concert, there will one in the afternoon. If you two ladies are willing, I happen to know the Manager of the Red Pavilion’s Cosmetics and Hairdressing area, and you can ask the service of the ladies there to apply makeup on you.”</p><p>Han Qingwu suddenly asked, “This Red Pavilion you mentioned, do they have a gym?”</p><p>“Yeah, there’s also a fitness area there.” Ji Mu nodded.</p><p>“Alright, let’s head there, then!” Said Han Qingwu. “Anyways, don’t you have something else to do this afternoon, Honghong? You don’t have to keep us company and just tend to your things. You can call us later after you’re done with it.”</p><p>Yu Hong hesitated for a moment, and then replied, “Nevermind it. I’ll call them saying that I have something to do and move it to another time. Even Young Master Ji can squeeze his time to accompany you, so if I leave…”</p><p>“No need, girl. Just go ahead and tend to your things first. You can call me again after you’re done. It’s fine, really. I will feel quite bad if your important matters were to be delayed because of me.” Han Qingwu did not want her to know that she was participating in the underground fighting match, hence the interruption.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
