Just like the beautiful mountain forest, everywhere of which was a bed of flowers and tree-shaded roads, and the wispy mist imparted a bit of mystique. But after Tang Xiu and others walked over the bridge and advanced less than a hundred meters, they stopped in a sudden, to be on their guards for a strange atmosphere.</p><p>A white pigeon.</p><p>Exactly.</p><p>It was a white pigeon, but its body was ten times larger than the ordinary white pigeon, it was not inferior even if compared with a cow. It wandered lazily in the grass and flowers, even the arrival of Tang Xiu and others had never shocked it, as it just gave them a careless glance, and then threw a flame from its beak.</p><p>It was a blue flame, and as soon as it touched the flowers and plants, the latter was burned out in an instant. When the ashes fell on the ground, a football-sized stone was contacted by the embers, it turned into blackened ashes and drifted with the wind.</p><p>“A… a monster…”</p><p>Xue Sha was very gutsy though, he was still shocked by the scene before him.</p><p>Tang Xiu took a meaningful look at the white pigeon, then he slowly moved his eyesight towards the surroundings. After just a few seconds, he found a climbing ant on a towering old tree. The ant had the size of an adult’s fist, and its claws could even be seen clearly a few tens of meters away.</p><p>“Look over there…”</p><p>Mo Awu suddenly exclaimed in a low voice.</p><p>Looking in the direction of Mo Awu’s finger pointed, the corner of Tang Xiu’s eye couldn’t help but twitch. In the bushes of forty or fifty meters away, a hedgehog bobbed up from the cave. The hedgehog’s physique was bigger than the cow-sized white pigeon, its quills were swinging regularly, and the white air exhaled from its nostrils above its pointed mouth was so cold that the flowers underneath it were covered a layer of frost.</p><p>“Keep going.”</p><p>(Original translation from Www.WangmamaRead.Com)</p><p>Tang Xiu didn’t feel hostility from these beasts. Even when he deliberately approached that white pigeon, it only took a look at him lazily, and then walked away as if it was walking in a courtyard.</p><p>After half an hour.</p><p>Though Tang Xiu was surprised, he still remained calm. While Mo Awu, Jin Shi and others were totally startled by the beasts here. Along the way, they had already encountered over one hundred species of animals after climbed up one-quarter of the height, and each animal’s volume was dozens and hundreds of times larger than other animals outside. These animals obviously had their own characteristics, but one commonality was that they all could fly – even a pig could walk in the void and fly slowly.</p><p>“The haven of spirit beasts.”</p><p>Tang Xiu recalled the spirit beasts that he raised in the immortal world, then a smile appeared on his face. These spirit beasts were all intelligent, and some spirit beasts had very high intelligence, such as that group of two-meter-high apes; these apes were not malicious to everyone, though they were frolicking happily and threw fruits at Tang Xiu and others several times.</p><p>“Boss, we can’t go further.”</p><p>With sweat hang on the forehead and face red, Mo Awu said with difficulty.</p><p>Tang Xiu looked at Mo Awu and other people. Finally, he said helplessly: “Since you can’t advance further, stay here! Awu, you are wearing the Spatial Ring, so let everyone pick precious herbs and store them with the ring. There are also spirit fruits and mineral, take them all.”</p><p>“Roger!”</p><p>Mo Awu nodded slightly, they encountered so many precious herbs and spirit fruits along the way, and some of them had even been growing for about one thousand years. There were various spirit fruits hanging on a large number of trees, and they could smell a touch of fruit even stayed in the distance from these trees. As for precious ores, there were a lot of them here. You could find several precious ores everywhere. Every single one of them would be sold at a high price in the market.</p><p>(Original translation from Www.WangmamaRead.Com)</p><p>There were no paths on the mountain.</p><p>Tang Xiu stepped on rocks, jumped and climbed under the pressure. He stored all the precious herbs, spicy fruits, ores he met in the Spatial Ring. It took him two hours to get halfway up the hill. What he had gained in two hours outweighed the sum of herbs, spicy fruits and ores he obtained outside.</p><p>“I can’t climb further.”</p><p>Overlooking the majestic palace at the peak of the mountain, Tang Xiu regretted because he was blocked by the formidable pressure above. Thanks to his physical strength which was far superior to that of ordinary people, otherwise he would not climb halfway up the mountain. Tang Xiu wanted to build his body and arouse his potentials with the help of this huge pressure. However, the Darkening Virus was not eliminated outside, so he had to give up and came back again when he was free.</p><p>While going down the hill, Tang Xiu met several spirit beasts that were seven or eight meters tall. Among them, a giant tiger’s breath made Tang Xiu’s heart trembled. Fortunately, these spirit beasts had no intention to attack anyone, and they even ignored Tang Xiu.</p><p>“Phew…”</p><p>Jumping down from a boulder and appearing behind Mo Awu, Tang Xiu smiled and said, “Fall in and we are leaving.”</p><p>Mo Awu quickly responded, “Boss, I suggest that we stay here for a while since there are plenty of resources. We came here with great efforts, it is better to take them back as much as possible and we will have more resources.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
