When two middle-aged men in black leather coats and a middle-aged man with a cold expression entered through the door, the guns of the Phantom Special Combat Squad’s members were instantly aimed at them.</p><p>“Tang Xiu, Divine Doctor Tang.”</p><p>The thin middle-aged man in the leather attire on the left had long loose blonde hair. He straightly ignored the members of the Phantom Special Combat Squad who were aiming their guns at him and walked straight to the front before he stopped about seven plus meters from Tang Xiu.</p><p>“Where are you from?” asked Tang Xiu indifferently.</p><p>“You don’t need to know our identity for the time being,” said the lean middle-aged man. “There’s only a clear point for you. Order these garbage men of yours to put their guns down and follow us alone. You will naturally know who we are when you come to our place.”</p><p>“What absurdity. A bumptious, self-opinionated idiot,” Tang Xiu sneered. “Don’t tell me you don’t know you are violating the laws of China! You’ve committed evil deeds inside the territory of our country!”</p><p>The lean middle-aged man looked grim and sullenly said, “The law is nothing but shit before us. Watch your mouth, Mr. Tang. We found you this fast, explaining our ability. Now we are inviting you with courtesy to give you face. You Chinese have an old adage, ‘refusing a toast will only make you swallow a forfeit’. Hence, I hope you reconsider, Mr. Tang.”</p><p>“Are you threatening me?” asked Tang Xiu.</p><p>“If soft means fail, then we have no choice but to resort to hard means,” the middle-aged man coldly replied. “But before that, I urge Mr. Tang to take this last chance. Follow us.”</p><p>Yu Shuqing was holding a gun and aimed its muzzle at the temple of the blonde-haired middle-aged man. While keeping his vigilance, he dashed to his front and said in a deep voice, “Mr. Tang will never go with you. Remember the consequences you will face first before you act!”</p><p>The thin middle-aged man turned to look at Yu Shuqing and observed him. He then nodded and said, “No wonder you have no fear, Mr. Tang. You turn out to have been protected by some masters, eh? If I’m not mistaken, these should be the special soldiers of the Chinese military, right? Since you want to resort to force, how about we pick one man as an appetizer and have a spar with each other?”</p><p>With that said, he clapped and eight men in suits with a saber on their backs dashed inside. A chilling aura was emanating from them, as they quickly stood in a row behind the thin middle-aged man.</p><p>Yu Shuqing himself could vaguely feel that these people were not ordinary. After pondering for a moment, he took a step back and said, “Gangzi, accompany them to play.”</p><p>This member of the Phantom Special Combat Squad was second only to Yu Shuqing in combat prowess. After handing over his gun to Mo Xiaonan, he lifted the other equipment on his body at a very fast speed. He twisted his neck and growled as he dashed a few steps forward and sneered, “Who’s going to play?”</p><p>The thin middle-aged man let out a mocking smile, raised his right hand and snapped his finger. The leftmost man in the row then stepped forward and came to Wei Chenggang’s front and said in english, “I’m the weakest in my team, but it’s still easy to pack you up. Come! Let me see the strength of a Chinese special forces’ team member!”</p><p>Wei Chenggang put on a combat stance and sneered, “Don’t flap your tongue when you brag. Bring it on!”</p><p>Tang Xiu secretly shook his head. The Stygian Club definitely had numerous hidden masters under their flag. The assassination agents he encountered in Laoshan, Changxi City, were all of the divergent races and possessed terrifying strength. This thin middle-aged man and the man next to him were similarly not human beings, and probably had very formidable strength as well. Each and every one of the eight men under this thin middle-aged man also had a thick smell of blood with intense murderous intention and soaring killing aura. It was enough evidence that they were very strong. At the very least, they were masters who had experienced many battles.</p><p>As for Wei Chenggang? He was not the opponent of that fella, not a chance.</p><p>Tang Xiu, however, did not intend to warn Wei Chenggang at all. He did not have a good impression toward these guys from the Phantom Special Combat Squad. Especially at this moment as he had yet to speak, but Yu Shuqing, the captain, already jumped out and let his men spar with the enemy. It was simply stupid.</p><p>At the same time, Tang Xiu also had another purpose. It would be best if all members of this Phantom special forces’ team got injured. In this case, they wouldn’t be able to tail him around, hence not affecting his actions and movements on Mist Source Island.</p><p>At this time, Wei Chenggang was full of confidence. He won the fighting championship in two military regions in a row. Despite still taking the enemy seriously, he subconsciously refused to believe that he could not win against the adversary. Seeing that the enemy did not take the initiative to attack, he was also disinclined to launch a sneak attack as his feet dashed in an instant and swiftly delivered a fierce kick toward him. This kick would definitely kill or at least severely injure the enemy if he was an ordinary person.</p><p>“Too slow.”</p><p>The other party shook his head and snorted. He grabbed Wei Chenggang’s bare feet and sent out a lightning-fast kick on the inside thigh of Wei Chenggang’s another leg. His fist also pounded instantly and directly hammered Wei Chenggang’s face.</p><p>Bam…</p><p>Wei Chenggang, who was full of confidence, was kicked and flew backwards by the opponent’s punch. His body then flew towards a nearby wall. If it was not for his strong resistance, his opponent’s heavy blow would have knocked him down already.</p><p>Just one move! And yet, it had straightly decided the winner and the loser.</p><p>The man spat on the spot where Wei Chenggang had fallen with a disdaining expression. He did not follow up on his attack, and neither did he go for the kill. With disdain and contempt on his face, he returned to stand behind the middle-aged man, folded his arms, and did not spare Wei Chenggang another glance.</p><p>The other members of the Phantom Special Combat Squad were dumbfounded. The expressions on their faces seemed like they just saw a monster. The whole team knew each other well and naturally realized how formidable Wei Chenggang’s combat prowess was. But never did they think the other party would be able to defeat him in just one strike!</p><p>Yu Shuqing was shocked. The other members of his Phantom squad could not see the attack trajectory of the enemy, as they only felt that the enemy’s speed was very fast with formidable strength. But he could clearly capture the trajectory of the enemy’s attack and could judge the terrifying speed of the enemy.</p><p>What a fast speed and strength!!</p><p>No members of my Phantom Special Combat Squad can be his opponent. Even if I were to fight with all my strength I may not be able to defeat this guy. Be it his strength or speed, he is way too strong.</p><p>Yu Shuqing looked at Tang Xiu with an ashamed face. He had begun to secretly regret inside for jumping out too early to protect Tang Xiu. At this moment, only then did he realize that Tang Xiu did not even shout, neither did he say or expressed anything ever since he jumped out.</p><p>Tang Xiu could grasp Yu Shuqing’s mental state from his expression. After a moment of silence, he then said lightly, “Victory and defeat is a common occurrence to a military commander. The failure this time doesn’t mean you will fail again in the future. As long as your ambition and spirit stay high, just continue to work, and then you can be sure that the day of victory will come to you sooner or later. Regardless of that, I’m the one who’s in charge of supervising Mist Source Island. Hence, no one is allowed to jump out without my order anymore.”</p><p>“I understand.” Yu Shuqing nodded with a bitter expression.</p><p>Tang Xiu then looked the thin middle-aged man and indifferently said, “You want to have a spar first, so I’ll accompany you to the end. Xue Sha, go play with them.”</p><p>Xue Sha emerged from the corner of the corridor and instantly appeared beside Tang Xiu. he cupped his fists and walked to the center between the two parties. Then, he grinned evilly and said, “I used to commit senseless killings and slaughters in the past. I always felt that it was very boring. Never did I think that I would meet this many masters to play with today. Hey, you, the brat from before. Come here and let’s play some!”</p><p>The lean middle-aged man snapped his fingers toward that man again and indifferently said, “The final time has yet to arrive, so there’s no need to kill out of anger. Still, don’t be merciful. You don’t need to kill him, just hit him enough to make him severely wounded.”</p><p>“Understood!”</p><p>The man responded and stared at Xue Sha in contempt as he then sprinted in the blink of an eye. In nearly a flash moment, he had dashed right in front of Xue Sha as he slammed out his palm all of a sudden, trying to slap Xue Sha’s forehead instantly.</p><p>“Hmph. Too slow!”</p><p>Xue Sha mockingly snorted. His figure instantly turned into a shadow. Before the man was able to take his strike back, his palm already pierced Xue Sha’s illusory image. His expression slightly changed after his sure hit strike missed. As he was about to prepare the second strike, a pair of slapping palms he could not see suddenly smashed him to the floor. Following that, Xue Sha seemed to send a light kick to the man’s abdomen, sending him to paddle and sweep the floor, as he then kicked the other side of his waist.</p><p>A single move! It was similarly one move, and Xue Sha had inflicted heavy losses to his opponent. As the man’s body swept the floor backward for seven-plus meters, he finally hit the lower part of the wall, badly hit his head, and straightly made him faint.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>The lean middle-aged man and his other comrades had their expressions turn extremely nasty. It was as though they had eaten a dead fly, nearly driving them crazy. Nonetheless, they also realized how terrifying Xue Sha was at this moment.</p><p>As for the Phantom Special Combat Squad, Mo Xiaonan was rendered speechless and dumbfounded when he saw Xue Sha take care of his opponent in just one move. He looked at Wei Chengguan who was already up and trembled. Suddenly, he elbowed Chen Yangfan and spoke in a toned down voice, “Tell me that I’m just dreaming, will you?”</p><p>“You’re not dreaming! It’s all real.”</p><p>Chen Yangfan gripped his fists tightly, and there was a frantic expression in his eyes that fixedly stared at Xue Sha. The others, however, had a disbelieving look along with deep admiration and respect in their eyes. They had never expected that Tang Xiu’s subordinate was able to stand up and even defeat the enemy.</p><p>Mo Xiaonan pinched his own thigh. He then shuddered and muttered to himself, “Just a while ago, Gangzi was defeated by him in just a move, but that expert who defeated Gangzi with one move turned out to be defeated by Tang Xiu’s subordinate with one move also…”</p><p>“This…”</p><p>“What does tit-for-tat mean? It just shows that if Tang Xiu’s men want to hit Gangzi, it’s akin to just pinching an ant, no?”</p><p>Xue Sha, however, looked a bit regretful when he saw his fainted opponent. He immediately turned to Tang Xiu and said with a smile, “Boss, since they want to pick a fight with you, I might as well clean them up first, don’t you think? Else, it will be annoying if these flies were to gather around us.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
