Her old classmates’ comments and envious looks cast a dense fog in her head.</p><p>“What exactly is going on?” Chen Xiaowan muttered to herself.</p><p>Wu Xiaoping rubbed his hands. With a smiling face that was full of flattering, he came to Chen Xiaowan and gave her 180 degrees bow, and then grinned, “Wow, Belle Chen, my dearest Goddess Xiaowan, do you still need a devoted and faithful slave? If you still need one, please receive me! I’ll do the laundry, the cooking, serve tea, anything. Absolute satisfaction guaranteed!!!”</p><p>Ji Jie slapped his shoulder and forcefully dragged him several meters away. She then came to Chen Xiaowan’s front, reorganized her clothes, cleared her throat, and then revealed a similarly flattering smile as she said, “Big Sis Xiaowan, our relationship should be the best one among our classmates, right? Well, whether you regard me as a very close person like your quilted jacket or your 24/7 attendant, just speak to me immediately if you need anything. I’ll always follow you behind in the future.”</p><p>“Me too! You still have me! Being able to serve Goddess Chen will definitely be the highest honor of my life.”</p><p>“Xiaowan, being a classmate once is the same as becoming relatives for three lifetimes. Besides, we were all one whole family 500 years ago, so you gotta let me cling onto your thigh in the future.”</p><p>“O’ Great Beauty Chen, do you still wish to receive a boytoy? I’m willing to become the second or third lover under your support.”</p><p>“…”</p><p>Chen Xiaowan was struck dumb and rendered speechless as she faced the flatter of her old fellow students. Her lips twitched a few times. She could vaguely tell that the actions of these people should be caused by the arrival of Tang Xiu and Ouyang Lulu.</p><p>As the merriment went by, Chen Xiaowan gradually understood what just happened. At this time, she looked at Wei Guotao with a smiling face. The disgust she had inside not only had disappeared but also replaced by a bit of gratefulness instead. While everyone else was chatting warmly, she secretly used her mobile to send Wei Guotao a text:</p><p>“So, back when you told me to go downstairs, it was intentional, wasn’t it? You were afraid that I’d be in danger when our classmates had a fight with those people?”</p><p>After receiving the text, Wei Guotao only replied with one word: “Yes.”</p><p>Chen Xiaowan thoroughly understood his intention and replied with a thank you. She directly cast away the idea to leave earlier, and while watching her old classmates gulp clean the two bottles of Gods Nectar, her heart was even more touched by what Tang Xiu, her younger brother, did.</p><p>Paradise Manor, Ouyang Lulu’s residence.</p><p>Tang Xiu sipped fragrant tea while reading the book, looking leisurely content. Ouyang Lulu was not there to accompany him, as she went to tend to business matters.</p><p>Ring, ring, ring…</p><p>The ringtone of his mobile broke the quiet atmosphere at this time.</p><p>Tang Xiu picked up his mobile. After finding that it was a call from Gu Xiaoxue, he immediately put it through and smilingly said, “Hello, Xiaoxue, is there something?”</p><p>“Did I disturb you, Grand Master?” Asked Gu Xiaoxue.</p><p>“Nope. It’s alright.” Tang Xiu smiled.</p><p>“Actually, there are three issues why I’m calling you,” said Gu Xiaoxue. “The first is that Master asked me to ask you when will you have time to visit Jingmen Island. She said… she misses you.”</p><p>Tang Xiu thought for a moment and replied, “The Magnificent Tang Corporation will hold a construction project tender bidding in Shanghai soon, so I can’t leave for the time being. Convey my message to Yan’er to wait for several days. I should be able to go to Jingmen Island in about a week.”</p><p>After complying, Gu Xiaoxue spoke again, “The second issue is about those adopted children you’ve received, Grand Master. Banshou and his team have picked up a lot of street children from all over the country, many of whom have good aptitudes. After a short training and screening, the number of those who have passed the training is 800 people in total. Also, we can’t accommodate more children in Jingmen Island. Do you want to choose another place to resettle them?”</p><p>Tang Xiu was slightly surprised, since he did not expect that Banshou and Dingzi would be this diligent and hard working. It took only six months for them to find this many street children. After pondering for a while, he then replied, “I’ll deal with this issue after I come to Jingmen Island. Tell me the third reason.”</p><p>“The Everlasting Feast Hall here has run out of funds, Grand Master,” said Gu Xiaoxue. “Our people have been purchasing a colossal number of precious herbs from abroad, along with a huge number of precious ores, jades, etc… Also, we have withdrawn all the funds held by our branches and stores at present. Furthermore, the consumption of more than 3,000 children, the salary, welfare, and benefits of the Everlasting Feast Hall’s employees are…”</p><p>Tang Xiu rubbed his temple and interrupted her, “You don’t have to report those small issues in detail. Just tell me how much funding you need.”</p><p>“The financial department has calculated that we need at least 8 to 10 billion in order to alleviate our current financial situation for the time being. Of course, it would be better if you can provide more,” answered Gu Xiaoxue.</p><p>Tang Xiu’s mouth twitched. He still had some money, but he was shocked by the number Gu Xiaoxue reported. He still had some money in his account but he did not know its specific amount, though it should be still around 10 billion yuan. He was worrying exactly about the amount of money he had as of recently and did not expect that the call from Gu Xiaoxue would also be related to this issue, making him feel that he was really short on money.</p><p>Tang Xiu lit up a cigarette, took a few deep puffs, and then said, “I don’t have that much money for the time being. I will check it out first, and then give you all the money I can use. If it’s not enough, call me again. I’ll find a way.”</p><p>“Understood.”</p><p>After hanging up, Tang Xiu smoked his cigarette and checked the amount he had in his account through mobile banking. He was a bit dumbfounded when he saw the balance: 9.812 billion.</p><p>Finished smoking, Tang Xiu clenched his teeth and directly transferred 9 billion yuan to Gu Xiaoxue, and then transferred 800 million to Kang Xia for use in the project in Shanghai after it started. Done with the transfer, he looked at the remaining 12 million in his account and could not help but groan.</p><p>Money, money, money.</p><p>He needed money now, desperately. Even if he had no need of it shortly, but once the construction project in Shanghai started, the follow-up was practically a money-burning process. In addition, the development and transformation of Clam Island and Resting Cemetery Island in the South China Sea would also require a colossal amount of funds. If the project in Nine Dragons Island was finished in June, there were still a lot of things he would need by that time. At least, it was a must to purchase a lot of jades.</p><p>The Magnificent Tang Corporation still had some money, but in a few months later the New City project in Star City would progress greatly and the internal purchase of its real estate would definitely require a lot of funds. He must wait until the opening quotation of the real estate market if he wanted to withdraw the funds from circulation.</p><p>How can I make a lot of money in the fastest and shortest time possible?</p><p>Gambling crossed Tang Xiu’s mind, but he directly cast the idea away. Money was not something that just fell from the sky, and casinos actually had some risk controls. It was fine if he only made a small amount of money, but he would probably offend a lot of people once he won too much.</p><p>What about buying lottery tickets?</p><p>As Tang Xiu thought about it, he could not help but force a wry smile. The amount of money in the prize pool of the major lottery institutions was just a drop in the bucket. It would be far from enough. Not to mention that it would garner attention from others if he did it excessively.</p><p>Should I intentionally find faults and blackmail some rich families?</p><p>The idea made Tang Xiu hollowly laugh twice and throw this thought away as well. He did not want to resort to this cheap, tasteless business. Unless those people offended him, he would not be cheeky to rob them.</p><p>That’s right. The Immortal Trove.</p><p>Tang Xiu’s eyes lit up. But the light only lasted for a few seconds before fading away. Firstly, let alone knowing that the Immortal Trove truly had some valuable things, just that Six Starlight Array itself was the thing he had yet to completely figure out. Some of the mysteries contained within were still somewhat tricky to crack despite his deep attainments arrays.</p><p>How about asking for support from the Tang Family?</p><p>The idea made Tang Xiu a bit depressed. The Tang Family indeed should still have a lot of funds as of now, but his grandfather just gave him 50 billion yuan a few months ago, and this money was their savings they had been secretly saving for many years—an amount that would not affect the Tang Family at all!</p><p>Two hours later.</p><p>When Ouyang Lulu returned to her residence and opened her bedroom’s door, she was immediately choked by the thick smoke inside. The smoke lingered in the heated room, making her cover her nose as she entered the room and quickly opened the windows. She then snappily glared at Tang Xiu, who was lost in thought and nested himself in the sofa, and then angrily said in a charming manner, “Why are you smoking so much? The smell is so bad!”</p><p>Tang Xiu snapped back to reality, and only then did he realize that the room was full of smoke. He immediately shook his head and smilingly said, “I smoke a lot without realizing it when I’m lost in thought and pondering about things.”</p><p>Ouyang Lulu’s expression moved and asked with a concerned expression, “What are you thinking about? Is it very troublesome?”</p><p>Tang Xiu replied with a helpless expression, “I’m very short on money! I was just a nouveau rich with nearly 10 billion yuan in my account, but it only took seconds before I became broke.”</p><p>“Where did the money go?” Asked Ouyang Lulu, astounded.</p><p>“Xiaoxue called me. She told me that the Everlasting Feast Hall is short on money, hence I directly transferred 9 billion to her,” said Tang Xiu. “On the other hand, the Magnificent Tang Corporation is preparing to construct its HQ and industrial park in Shanghai, so I transferred the remaining 800 million to Kang Xia. Added with the amount of funds I gave her previously, it should be enough to carry out the initial stage of the project. But then again, I have no money left now.”</p><p>Ouyang Lulu took her wallet and took out a bank card from the inside, and then smilingly said, “I can’t be compared to you or those rich rednecks with billions in their bank accounts, but I still have the income from my own private property on Jingmen Island and this Paradise Manor. All the money is in this bank card equal to nearly 80 million yuan. Just take it as pocket money first, and then call me again if you require more.”</p><p>Haih…</p><p>Tang Xiu sighed twice and pushed her hand back. He just felt upset and complained to himself, but he did not want to take money from Lulu. Seeing her expression, Tang Xiu directly pulled her to his lap and said with a smile, “I’m not short on pocket money, and I can still get 18 million yuan by myself. I’m just thinking about how to make more money in a short period of time. Just hold the money in this card. You don’t have to give it to me, I will take the initiative to ask you when I really need it.”</p><p>Ouyang Lulu looked satisfied and nodded. After taking back the card, she said, “In any case, I have determined to be with you. Everything I have, thus all of my money and all of my assets are also yours. If worse comes to worst, you can also sell this Paradise Manor. Shortly put, you just need to tell me.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
