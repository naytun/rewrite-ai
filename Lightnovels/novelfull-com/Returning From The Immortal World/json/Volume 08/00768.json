The pill he used was the Holy Healing medicine he got from Ji Chimei. Although not much, it was usually taken by those cultivators after all, how could the Darkening Virus compete with it?</p><p>As a matter of fact.</p><p>Ji Chimei followed Gu Yan’er to the earth, and her Spatial Ring was destroyed in the Spatial Tide, all the items in it were lost. If not so, once she could use the fairy cauldron to refine the medicine, even the worst medicine would be an elixir.</p><p>“Sister, where are those people?”</p><p>Tang Xiu stood up and asked with a smile.</p><p>Tang Han said, “Come with me! They are accommodated in the dormitory beside the training field, now they should be assembled on the training field.”</p><p>A few minutes later.</p><p>Tang Xiu and Tang Han, followed by Mo Awu and others, came to the training field of Tang Zhuang Martial Arts School. There were two hundred and six core members of the Martial Arts School and twelve confidants cultivated by Tang Han. These people were all real martial arts experts, although no one had reached the level of martial arts grandmaster, no one could look down on their strength.</p><p>“Give me clear water.”</p><p>Tang Xiu took the water from Mo Awu under the watchful eyes of everyone and then dissolved one and a half of the Holy Healing medicine into the water.</p><p>“Original translation from Www。WangmamaRead。Com。”</p><p>Tang Han looked very serious, she said in a deep voice, “Some of you may know this person beside me, some may not. But whether you know him or not, I have to tell you that he is my younger cousin, Tang Xiu, and he was sent here by the family to deal with the infectious disease.”</p><p>“Remember, because the medicine is extremely rare, I can only share it with my closest confidants. So, once you take the pill and become completely free from the infectious disease, you must keep it a secret.”</p><p>At that moment, the pleasure showed in Tang Han’s confidant subordinates’ faces, they had been beset by the Darkening Virus for a long time, and even in their hearts, they were caught in the toils of despair. Although through the stimulation of the static electricity, the deterioration of the Darkening Virus could be suppressed temporarily, it only was a glimmer of hope.</p><p>Now, however.</p><p>They finally realized that the crisis could be handled and their security could be guaranteed.</p><p>As the drug used to dissolve the Holy Healing medicine was taken by everyone, Tang Han immediately disbanded all people. She knew what would happen after taking the drug, so she certainly did not want to see the embarrassment of her subordinates, neither she wanted to smell the stench.</p><p>Back to Tang Han’s study, Tang Xiu sat down and asked, “Who is the richest and most powerful person on Mist Source Island? Is his surname Miao?”</p><p>Tang Han was surprised, “Miao Hengfu? Why do you want to ask about him?”</p><p>A cold light burst from Tang Xiu’s eyes, he said, “If just feed without teaching, it is all the father’s fault. His son, Miao Wenlei was an asshole. I killed Miao Wenlei and some of his hired roughnecks. Well… Since it has been played out this way, it’s necessary to destroy evil, leaving no chance for its revival .”</p><p>Being shocked, Tang Han looked at Tang Xiu with a stunned expression. And after a long while before she smiled bitterly and said, “Younger Brother, you are really something… well, forget it, since it has been done, it must be destroyed. In fact, it’s not ‘If just feed without teaching, it is all the father’s fault,’ instead, it’s totally just a counterexample to ‘Like father, like son.’ Miao Hengfu was cruel and evil and full of cunning tricks, for so many years, no one knows how many people on earth has he scourged. But every time he did it very clean, and even if the government wants to take action, no evidence could be found. What’s more, he is protected by his powerful friend!”</p><p>Tang Xiu frowned and asked, “Powerful friend? Who is it?”</p><p>Tang Han said: “Shanghai, the Mu family, Mu Jianhua.”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>Tang Xiu was shocked and exclaimed.</p><p>Tang Han was bewildered, saying, “What’s wrong? Although the Mu clan is powerful in the capital but compared with our Tang clan, I’m afraid they still have a long way to go? You shouldn’t have been so surprised.”</p><p>Tang Xiu hesitated and said with a bitter smile, “Only the Mu clan itself won’t make me surprised. The problem is… Mu Jianhua is my nominal future father-in-law.”</p><p>“Pu…”</p><p>Tang Han pulled a wry face and said: “Brother, you are awesome! Mu Wanying, the first beauty in the capital has fallen in love with you. However… Hahaha, you have killed the son of a man under your future father-in-law’s protection. I dare to say if you kill Miao Hengfu, Mu Jianhua will fight hard with you.”</p><p>Tang Xiu could not help but said bitterly, “Will he?”</p><p>Tang Han smiled and said, “Won’t he? He will surely do that. People in the Mu clan treat Mu Jianhua as a failure. Even his father, the head of the clan, won’t pass the throne to him. I’m convinced that you have a basic understanding of your future father-in-law. He is a man who… Let’s put it this way, if you kill Miao Hengfu, you will destroy your father-in-law’s most important source of wealth. It will be strange if he doesn’t fight hard with you.”</p><p>Tang Xiu frowned and said, “I don’t think so. If Miao Hengfu provides an important source of wealth to Mu Jianhua, how could Mu Jianhua ask her daughter for money for the remedy?”</p><p>Tang Han was somewhat surprised and continued, “You may have underestimated how fast your future father-in-law squanders his money. Apart from anything else, I heard that three years ago, he lost six hundred million at Las Vegas in one go.”</p><p>“Oh my God…”</p><p>Tang Xiu was shocked by Mu Jianhua’s splurge.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
