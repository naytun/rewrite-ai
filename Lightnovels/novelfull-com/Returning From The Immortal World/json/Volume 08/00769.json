But Tang Xiu never thought that he could have lost 600 million in a gamble.</p><p>It was six hundred million!</p><p>Although in his eyes 600 million was just peanuts, it was astronomical for many people. And even for some people, they could never earn a tenth or even one percent of it.</p><p>“Such a wastrel.”</p><p>At that moment, Tang Xiu couldn’t help but feel sympathy for Mu Wanyin, whose dad was such a person. That was really rotten luck for her. Lighting a cigarette, Tang Xiu took a few mouthfuls and took the final decision in his heart. Miao Hengfu would avenge his son’s murder. And now that he had killed Miao Wenlei, he had no choice but to remove the source of the trouble. Nonetheless, he couldn’t kill Miao Hengfu in a big way, or it would be known by Mu Jianhua. Even if Mu Jianhua could do nothing to him, he would hold a grudge against Tang Xiu.</p><p>All of a sudden.</p><p>Tango Xiu had a brain wave, an excellent idea struck him.</p><p>Peering at Tang Xiu, Tang Han was somewhat curious about it. She wondered after knowing that Mu Jianhua was the one behind Miao Hengfu, what would his brother do?</p><p>“What were you thinking about?”</p><p>Tang Xiu smiled slightly and said, “Just some tricks.”</p><p>Tang Han became interested in the conversation, she asked smilingly, “What tricks? Tell me.”</p><p>Having a smile, Tang Xiu didn’t answer her directly. Instead, he called Mo Awu and others and instructed, “Ye Shisan, you are less than 30, aren’t you? And your face feature is similar to Miao Wenlei who was killed by me. If I help you to disguise as Miao Wenlei, can you imitate him to perform the arrogance?”</p><p>Ye Shisan nodded without hesitation and said, “I have seen him before. It’s no problem to imitate him.”</p><p>“Original translation from Www。WangmamaRead。Com。”</p><p>Tang Xiu said with satisfaction, “In this case, Jin Shi, Xue Sha, Hei Xiong, Gu Tao, Zhang Jue, Zidan and you must hurry to the village south of the mountain in the center of Mist Source Island. Zidan and others have explored the village, which found out that other than the more than 20 people stationed in the eastern side of the village, I screened through the network and finally determined that they are from the Mexican Mafia syndicate, the Reston, and the leader is the Reston’s second in command, a ruthless person called Zhenlei Duomu. We have yet to investigate the other three forces since there are too few sources of information available here. Your task is to provoke members of the Reston, and you’d better kill a few of them and leave the name of Miao Wenlei before the retreat.”</p><p>Ye Shisan suddenly saw the light and asked Tang Xiu, “Boss, you mean imputing the responsibility to Miao Wenlei?”</p><p>Tang Xiu nodded and replied, “That’s right. Anyway, Miao Wenlei is dead, and it can be claimed that dead men tell no tales. I’m aiming at making ZhenLei Duomu, the deputy leader of Reston, go mad and fight with Miao Hengfu recklessly and Miao Hengfu counterattack hard in revenge for his son.”</p><p>Ye Shisan nodded seriously, saying, “Boss, I can assure you the mission will be accomplished.”</p><p>After waving his hand to motion Ye Shisan and others to leave, Tang Xiu looked at Mo Awu and said, “You must lead Feng Yang, Shui Gui and Hei Wuya to investigate all the foreign forces on Mist Source Island in the shortest possible time. They harbor some evil intentions, so we won’t neglect them or let them go unchecked.”</p><p>“Yes, sir.”</p><p>Understanding Tang Xiu’s responsibility on Mist Source Island, Mo Awu took the three people away.</p><p>Looking at their receding figures, Tang Han hesitated and said, “Brother, are they capable of doing that? Or we wait a while first until my subordinates recover and join them?”</p><p>Tang Xiu said with a smile, “It is unnecessary for the time being. Each of them is a master that can defeat a group of one hundred enemies. They are proficient in accomplishing such missions, so please rest assured! I’ll ask your subordinates to join them when necessary.”</p><p>“Bang bang…”</p><p>Someone knocked at the door, then a middle-aged woman in her forties went into the room and looked at Tang Xiu with a grateful look. She said, “Schoolmaster, Mr. Tang, we investigated the identity of Li Wei. She comes from Twin Brook City, and her parents were killed two days ago. Through checking the video surveillance, we confirmed that it was conducted by the people of Miao Wenlei. Li Wei… suffered many sexual assaults from Miao Wenlei and has tremendous physical and mental trauma. After our comfort, she’s now sleeping.”</p><p>“Bastard.”</p><p>Tang Han clenched her fist angrily and stroke the armrest of the sofa.</p><p>Tang Xiu thought for a moment and said slowly, “Sister, Li Wei will stay with you! Later I have a lot of things to deal with, it’s not convenient for me to bring a little girl.”</p><p>Tang Han nodded and said, “Don’t worry about that, when the crisis of Mist Source Island is resolved, I will send someone to investigate whether she has other relatives. It’s best that she has some relatives alive; If not, she can stay at Tang Zhuang Martial Arts School as my foster kid.</p><p>“That works out.”</p><p>Tang Xiu nodded and said.</p><p>In the valley dozens of kilometers south of Twin Brook City, a large number of heavily armed robust guards were patrolling around tens of military tents. In the largest tent which sat in the middle, the War Intelligence Elder Wu Jie, one of the Pyramids’ ten War Elders, kept pacing up and down with his golden walking stick in the front of a map of Mist Source Island.</p><p>Two and a half hours ago, according to the agreed time, Siou and other subordinates should have called; besides, they didn’t answer his call, which made Wu Jie’s heart heavy.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
