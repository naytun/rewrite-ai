But then he realized that this man probably knew his identity as a cultivator. After all, regardless of whether he was the one who sold the talismans needed by the Situ Family or the fact that he killed Jin Sanchi, Jin Sijie, and Daoist Qiankun, as well as the man to be held responsible for the eradication of the eight families and forces from Strange Doors, what and who he was had probably been investigated by the clans under the Strange Doors.</p><p>He’s afraid of me.</p><p>Tang Xiu shot Situ Hong a deep look and could see a burst of fear from his eyes, making him immediately force a smile inside.</p><p>At the side, Xue Yu was left astounded and surprised, while Huo Siming was even more dumbfounded. No matter what he thought, he found it unbelievable. He could not think through why would an elderly go as far as empty his pocket to buy such a precious fruit and then gift it to the others in vain? The most ridiculous thing was that he seemed to be afraid that the other party would not receive it and even spoke in an apologetic manner.</p><p>As for Black Widow, she was tongue-tied and dumbfounded with a disbelieving expression cast on her face. She could hardly believe her ears, for this man was the most honored ancestor, a high ranking member of the Situ Family. To her, he was an aloof and lofty figure, and yet, he spoke to Tang Xiu in such an obsequious and humble manner. What was the most unacceptable fact for her was that this old ancestor of the Situ Family seemed… afraid of this young man in front, and even tried… to fawn upon him?</p><p>What is happening here?</p><p>Is it possible that there is a figure in China who could make such a character to dread him, despite the status held by the Situ Family and the ability possessed by their old ancestor?</p><p>For fear that Situ Hong was muddle headed by his aging brain, Black Widow immediately reminded after coming back to her senses, “Elder Situ, Senior. Are you not mistaken? He…”</p><p>“I’m not muddleheaded nor I’m mistaken in recognizing him.” Situ Hong categorically said. “My treatment towards Grandmaster Tang a while ago was bad, a big mistake that I must correct by myself. Hence, I must compensate Grandmaster Tang with this fruit.”</p><p>With that said, he strode forward to Tang Xiu’s front and handed over the Singular Recherché Fruit with both hands, saying, “Grandmaster Tang, please don’t stoop to my level of ignorance and forgive me. I sincerely admit my mistake and am willing to correct it. Please accept this fruit as a token of my apology and give me the opportunity to make up for my mistake.”</p><p>Tang Xiu was at a loss whether he had to cry or laugh as he looked at Situ Hong. He could not refuse it since the old man already said such. He received the Singular Recherché Fruit and then said with a smile, “You’re Situ Hong, right? Those from the Situ Family are indeed good people. They can make me satisfied every time. Alright. I accept this Singular Recherché Fruit.”</p><p>Situ Hong looked a bit joyous and sincerely said, “The pleasure and honor is mine. By the way, it should be noon shortly, may I ask whether I can have the honor to invite you to lunch, Grandmaster Tang?”</p><p>Tang Xiu thought for a while before shaking his head and said, “I can’t. There’s something I need to tend to, so  I can only pass your lunch invitation. However, I’ll send you a big gift on the account of this Singular Recherché Fruit. You’d better go to Hong Kong half a month later to see Li Juren. I’m sure you can have a good harvest then.”</p><p>Li Juren?</p><p>Situ Hong looked dull for a moment. He also knew Li Juren and had a bit of friendship with him. Although he did not know what kind of big gift Tang Xiu would give him, he still respectfully replied, “I will visit Li Juren in person by that time.”</p><p>Tang Xiu nodded in response and then bade his farewell before taking his leave with Xue Yu. Their purpose in coming to the medicinal herbs market was for this Singular Recherché Fruit, to begin with. Now that they had obtained, he did not want to stay here any longer.</p><p>Inside the office.</p><p>Situ Hong did not rush to leave. There was a relieved expression on his old face, like a heavy burden had been unloaded from his shoulders. Even the wrinkles on his face stretched out and a smile climbed up his face when he sat back on the sofa.</p><p>“Elder Situ, I don’t understand,” said Black Widow with clenched teeth after taking a seat.</p><p>Huo Siming was similarly baffled and echoed, “I don’t understand either. I know that Tang Xiu is the young divine doctor that recently appeared in the Chinese medical world and I also have a bit of admiration toward him. Despite that, though, given your status and identity, I still can’t think through why you acted so…”</p><p>“So cautious? So respectful? Or so flattering?”</p><p>Situ Hong glanced at him. The smile on his old face did not change as he spoke, “He’s not someone worthy for me to act like this if he was really just an ordinary person. But exactly who is he really, then? The young divine doctor? Hahaha… how honorable and to what degree his true identity is is not something you can ever imagine. Alright, forget all this. This is something you had better not know about. Shortly put, just remember that you must never offend him in the future. Best if you can see him as a little ancestor…”</p><p>Hmph.</p><p>Huo Siming snorted in disdain inwardly but did not refute Situ Hong on the surface. He was just a medicinal herbs trader and an old man already, but it was unlikely for him to be skinless and unabashed like Situ Hong.</p><p>Other than that, was the Situ Family famous? He knew a lot of prominent families from various provinces, but never once had he heard of a notable family with the Situ surname.</p><p>Black Widow paid attention and attached great importance to Situ Hong’s warning nonetheless. She firmly nodded and looked toward the door with a somewhat complicated expression. She knew Situ Hong’s status in the Situ Family. The man could even make the people from the Situ Family to obsequiously smile at him in response to his casual words. Despite his highly respected and honorable status in the Strange Doors he still had to be respectful before him?</p><p>But then again… exactly which sacred being was this Tang Xiu?</p><p>In the medicinal herbs market.</p><p>Tang Xiu planned to leave directly, but then Xue Yu said that she must buy some additional medicinal herbs for the medicated diet supplements, so he had to follow her seeking them in each store and stall to buy it. In just half an hour, he saw Xue Yu buying the supplemental medicinal herbs and spending more than 270 thousand yuan.</p><p>What a spendthrift! Tang Xiu could not bear but secretly shake his head.</p><p>Eventually, when the last medicinal herb Xue Yu bought was wrapped, she then said with a slightly regretful expression, “I have bought all the medicinal herbs needed to make this medicated diet. But it’s a pity this place is not in the Miao region, else I would have obtained the most important supplemental herb, ginseng, rather than the artificially cultivated common ginseng.”</p><p>“Tell me, young lady, do you know the price of a wild ginseng?” Tang Xiu forced a smile. “Let’s take the Millennium Wild Ginseng for instance; you won’t be able to buy it without preparing nine digits. You told me before that the Singular Recherché Fruit is valued beyond nine digits. So, added with the Millennium Wild Ginseng and the other supplemental herbs, you would have to spend 200 to 300 million yuan just to make one medicated diet alone. This… isn’t this just wasting money?! Even the richest man in the world won’t be able to withstand the way you toss him over and over again.”</p><p>Xue Yu only smiled in response. Though both her hands carried a lot of bags, she went to Tang Xiu’s side to get closer and smiled lightly. “The medicated diet I’m about to make for you this time is not the same as the usual diet I give you. It is made based on the record written by my family’s ancestors. According to it, this medicated diet will be like a panacea elixir and give enormous advantages to the person who takes it. I’m afraid that even I myself can’t drink much even if I want to.”</p><p>“Why?” Asked Tang Xiu, baffled.</p><p>“My body can’t take on the medical efficacy, that’s why,” said Xue Yu.</p><p>Tang Xiu’s eyes lit up. He gave it a thought and then resolutely said, “Since you really want to make a perfect medicated diet, then I’ll follow your intention. I have a Millenium Wild Ginseng. I’ll give it to you after we got back to the apartment.”</p><p>“Really?” Xue Yu’s expression greatly changed and asked with joy.</p><p>“Of course, it’s real!” Tang Xiu snappily replied. “When have I, Tang Xiu, ever lied? Just take it easy, will you? You can only use a little bit of this Millennium Wild Ginseng! Besides, it’s quite difficult to obtain wild ginseng nowadays. Finding it can make your hair erect due to distress.”</p><p>Four hours later.</p><p>At the Tomson Villa’s apartment. Although Tang Xiu was sitting in the living room, the strong scent of medicine fluttered about and filled the entire hall. Be it back in the Immortal World or after returning, he had consumed quite a lot of medicated diets of every kind. But this time, just the scent alone had already aroused his appetite. Something that rarely happened to him.</p><p>“Alright. Wash your hands and have it.”</p><p>Xue Yu came out of the kitchen with an apron and a purple casserole in her hands. When she came to the dining room, she carefully opened the lid of the purple casserole while Tang Xiu washed his hands. A mellow and fragrant scent of medicated diet wafted about in the room very fast. After putting it in front of Tang Xiu, she quickly said, “You’re a cultivator, so you’re very strong. Do pay attention after you drink it to not ignore the efficacy and energy contained inside this medicated died because of the flavor.”</p><p>Tang Xiu just smiled and didn’t pay her words any mind. Just as he prepared to pick up the bowl and drink it, he saw Xue Yu taking a small spoon of medicated diet from the casserole and then used her pink tongue to lick it with a cautious and careful manner.</p><p>That’s right! She’s licking it.</p><p>Tang Xiu had been used to the serious and cold Xue Yu. Now that he saw her appearance of using her sensual pink tongue to lick the medicated diet, an unusual sense of alluring feeling and even a strong impulse burst out inside him and made his lower abdomen feel hot.</p><p>I’ll be damned!</p><p>Tang Xiu hurriedly lowered his head and silently chanted the “Heart-fire Cleansing Art” to suppress the heat down there. At this moment, drinking the medicated diet was the most important thing to do. After all, even though it was less than two bowls, this medicated diet had burned 200 to 300 million yuan; a large amount of money.</p><p>What a luxury!</p><p>Regardless, drinking it made Tang Xiu feel the pinch. After he swallowed it, a mighty torrent of hot sensation instantly burst open. It was as though it had turned into thousand strands of heat, like a tidal wave that rushed to his limbs and bones.</p><p>“Drink it up quickly, Tang Xiu. The efficacy will leak away greatly once the lid is opened. The earlier you drink it, the more of the efficacy will be retained,” Xue Yu looked up and reminded Tang Xiu. She finally stopped licking the medicated diet after carefully sipping a mouthful of it.</p><p>Tang Xiu looked dull and immediately gulped down all the medicated diet in the bowl. There was a worried look on Xue Yu’s face as she directly poured the remaining medicated diet in the purple casserole into her half-filled bowl, and gulped it down into her stomach.</p><p>“Hot!”</p><p>After Tang Xiu finished it, that was the only sensation he felt. Not only did he feel the heat on his skin, he felt hot all over his body, and even his internal organs were also as though being wrapped by the dreadful heat.</p><p>At this moment, despite how tough his willpower was, Tang Xiu still left dizzy by the sudden burst of medicinal power as he felt that his whole body seemed to have to become a melting furnace.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
