Not even the heavy rains and thunderous lightning were able to pose any threat to her and Tang Xiu.</p><p>“They seem to have some troubles.”</p><p>Ji Chimei kept watching the scene with an indifferent look. Her voice was as cold as a glacier stream. Those below were like existences akin to ants in her eyes; she would not even waste her time here if it was not because her Lordship cared about this matter.</p><p>“Well, encountering troubles is pretty much a good thing, you know. There’s no way anyone can be reborn without tempering and sail smoothly forever,” said Tang Xiu lightly. “You were born in the Immortal World, so you should’ve heard the story about the Pure Yang Immortal, yes? He was a fellow who grew up under the shelter of eagles’ wings and never had encountered any hardships, waves, or storms in his life. He had countless resources to support him, resulting in his cultivation reaching Supremacy in the Record of the Immortal. He even reached the stage of the Perfected Golden Immortal. But what happened to him in the end? He had a hard tussle and was directly killed by a new Immortal who just ascended to the Immortal World. He eventually became the laughingstock of countless immortals in the Immortal World.”</p><p>“You’re right, Lord.” Ji Chimei nodded in full agreement and said, “Such flowers in the greenhouse will forever be unable to endure the endless years of hardships. They are not comparable to the weeds which withstand the sweep of wind and are battered by the rains. But may this subject ask you about something, Lord? This lass called Viviani, is she one of our people?”</p><p>Tang Xiu shook his head with an indifferent expression. He was also clueless as to why Xue Yu’s divination was related to him. He and Viviani were just casually acquainted and they had not formed any friendship at all. Even if she was killed before his eyes, it was not something that related to him, right?</p><p>Certainly, this was also the reason why he and Ji Chimei did not immediately appear in front of Viviani after arriving here. He wanted to find out the truth about what exactly Viviani had encountered and how she could be in such a messy and difficult situation.</p><p>“By the way, you also know about Brightwing race, don’t you Chimei?” Tang Xiu suddenly turned and asked.</p><p>“Yes.” Ji Chimei nodded and answered, “The Brightwing race is one of the myriads of races in the Immortal World. But this race kind of has a pitiful fate, as countless people are always looking at them with greedy eyes ever since their birth. Especially those females who are born, as each of them is an otherworldly beauty. In the eyes of those countless powerhouses in the Immortal World, they are treated as their plaything. As far as I know, this race only has an incomplete cultivation system and it’s also much more difficult than an ordinary immortal cultivation technique. Thus, there has been no strong powerhouses born from the Brightwing race even after tens of thousands of years.”</p><p>Tang Xiu nodded and said, “I’ve been having a suspicion that this Viviani has the Brightwing race bloodline. Yet I can’t figure out how someone with the Brightwing bloodline can appear on Earth?”</p><p>Ji Chime stared blankly before shock appeared on her face and she said, “Now that I recall, there was a rumor back then, Lord. Even though the Brightwing race has never produced a powerful expert, there was a sage born among them called Paramita Vienna. She once produced a hypothesis that, if their race were to descend to a lower plane and their bloodline was to merge into a mortal’s body, the offspring will have both human and Brightwing bloodlines. If Viviani really has a Brightwing race bloodline, it’s highly likely that she may be an offspring resulting from this hypothesis.”</p><p>“But isn’t it way too ridiculous?” Tang Xiu frowned and said, “Even if some immortals want to descend to an ordinary plane, the space law won’t allow them to do so even if the space law of that lower plane is not of a high-grade, no? Hardly anyone will able to come here unless those immortals have broken through to the stage of Perfected Golden Immortal. And yet, those who have broken through the realm of Perfected Golden Immortal are a very formidable existence already. It wouldn’t be difficult for them to shelter a weak race should one wish to do so. ”</p><p>“I’m not clear regarding that issue either, my Lord,” Ji Chimei shook her head.</p><p>Tang Xiu shook his head and threw his confusion to the back of his mind, concentrating his vision to look below toward the ships instead.</p><p>On the liner’s bow.</p><p>Wang Rui’s stubbornness didn’t make Viviani feel at ease. It made her worry even more instead. She didn’t want to fight hard against the Savage Mammoth’s people as she knew that it would be like throwing an egg against a rock in a head-on battle. She wished Wang Rui would take his men and leave whereas she would take the speedboat and quickly escape.</p><p>This Wang Rui, however, was too arrogant and stubborn at the same time.</p><p>The distance between the liner and the cargo ship kept getting shorter. Wang Rui and Viviani could clearly see fully armed men and women on that ship. On the bow of the cargo ship, they even saw a silver-haired old man standing proudly with hands crossed behind his back.</p><p>“This will be troublesome.”</p><p>The big man who stood beside Wang Rui spoke. His heart thumped wildly after seeing the silver-haired old man and a chill even filled his heart.</p><p>“What’s troublesome?” asked Wang Rui, frowning.</p><p>“This spells big trouble for us, Boss,” The staunch man bitterly said, “It’s highly likely that old man is a bigshot of the Savage Mammoth. His position should be like a sect’s Law Enforcement Hall Master in ancient times of our country. Rumor has it that this man is very terrifying, though nobody has ever seen him in action. This is because, according to the rumors, those who have seen him in action all died. This old codger should probably be the most horrifying power from the mysterious leader of Savage Mammoth.”</p><p>“Hmph… are you trying to raise the enemy’s prestige to undermine our own morale?” Wang Rui snorted coldly and said, “I’ve reached the martial arts grandmaster level and you’re just a step away from a higher stage as well. I believe we can completely annihilate them even if there are only two of us who take action. What’s more, don’t forget that we also have a non-human that came with us this time.”</p><p>The burly man subconsciously glanced at another liner’s cabin and felt greatly at ease. He naturally knew the ‘non-human’ individual Wang Rui mentioned. That person was one of the strongest even in Qingcheng Mountain.</p><p>Quickly, the distance of the two liners and the cargo ship shortened to less than a hundred meters. As both parties stopped moving, the silver-haired old man on the cargo ship’s bow shouted in fluent English, “All of you surrender immediately, no matter who you are. We’ll check out your ship. We’re chasing our enemy. If you dare to shelter our enemy, we’ll see you as an enemy as well!”</p><p>The silver-haired old man’s loud and clear voice made Wang Rui secretly startled inside, yet he was still able to compose himself and loudly shouted back, “Your Savage Mammoth’s people are really arrogant, aren’t you? This is China’s territory and yet you dare to act arrogantly here? Do you not fear that all of you will die in this sea?”</p><p>“Unbridled and extremely arrogant? Hahaha.” The silver-haired old man burst into laughter and loudly said, “I’ve always been despotic and arrogant. You can choose to refuse but I can twist and dig out your heart. Hahaha… Do not fucking make me say it a second time! Surrender immediately and squat down on the bow! I can spare your puny lives if I’m in a good mood.”</p><p>Wang Rui grimly turned his head and ordered, “Get serious and board that cargo ship! Those who dare threaten me must die. KILL THEM ALL!”</p><p>Half a minute later, the two liners were just 20 meters away from the cargo ship, while the twenty-plus men were all ready to board the cargo ship to carry out the one-sided massacre. Four shadows suddenly dashed forward and sprinted the 20 meters.</p><p>Four blades made a showy display of their power, fully suffused with killing intent, and hacked down toward Wang Rui. Even their speed was much faster than Wang Rui’s ability to avoid them.</p><p>“SCRAM!”</p><p>The big man instantly flashed out his dagger and hardly blocked one of the long blades. The nearest hazy shadow, however, flashed at the same time with a long heavy spear. After being seized by the burly man in an instant, his momentum kept increasing and the long spear turned into layers of spear shadows. They directly blocked all assaults toward Wang Rui.</p><p>“HUMAN LADDER BRIDGE!”</p><p>The silver-haired old man on the cargo ship’s bow shouted in a deep voice.</p><p>Suddenly, 12 people who stood behind the old man wearing black robes and covered with black hoods instantly leaped toward the liner. One of them rushed forward and another followed who instantly stepped on his leg; the moment he was about to fall, the other dashed forward again, followed by the rest who sprinted continuously. They used their bodies as supports for the next ones who kept sprinting.</p><p>This ‘human ladder bridge’ truly had an artistic sense to it. It had a perfect leaping effect, shown by those 12 men in black robes needing only a few breaths to dash and finally board the liner. As those black-robed men scattered around, they pulled out cane blades from their backs and frenziedly dragged Wang Rui’s men into a fight.</p><p>“ROAR…”</p><p>Suddenly, a man with green eyes let out a loud beastly roar. His nails began to quickly grow and a layer of thick hair emerged and covered his body. His strength, which was previously at the level of a martial arts grandmaster, suddenly increased several times. The moment his feet kicked off from the floor, his figure stormed forward toward one of Wang Rui’s men as though he was a hungry tiger rushing towards his prey. His sharp nails swept at his opponent’s neck, killing him with that one strike.</p><p>“Hiss… hiss…”</p><p>A layer of thick scales suddenly emerged on the body of another man. His body began to transform as if he was deprived of all of his bones. His entire body turned very soft, swaying and swinging like a willow being blown by the wind, constantly revolving around another one of Wang Rui’s men and attacking him.</p><p>Sharp fangs rapidly grew in that man’s mouth followed by incisive breaths within. This guy’s swift and violent strike directly killed another subordinate of Wang Rui.</p><p>“Poison mist!”</p><p>The silver-haired old man on the cargo ship, however, seemed to be very unsatisfied with the current flow of the battle. He loudly shouted another command after several of Wang Rui’s men had been killed.</p><p>Immediately after, 16 experts of Savage Mammoth boarded the liner, each holding a porcelain vase. Quickly following, each unplugged their vase’s cap at the same time. A surge of light green mist billowed out which was wrapped by the strong wind, spreading in all directions.</p><p>Wang Rui’s countenance changed and he ragingly shouted, “BE CAREFUL! THAT MIST IS POISONOUS!”</p><p>The moment the poisonous mist was released by the enemy, the staunch man took the opportunity to stab his opponent’s belly with his spear. However, at the moment he wanted to directly kill the enemy, a spear shaft suddenly flew out and stabbed his chest in an instant.</p><p>“Puff…”</p><p>Blood wildly spurted out as the staunch man’s body violently trembled a few times before slowly slumping down to the floor.</p><p>“BASTARD!”</p><p>Wang Rui roared and pushed back the enemy in front of him, then appearing in front of the staunch man. Never once did he ever dream that his powerful subordinate, who was much more powerful than the rest of his men, would unexpectedly fall under the enemy’s attack at this moment.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
