Outside the high outer walls that surrounded Kangsha Pharmaceutical, two ghostly figures silently approached and easily climbed a bleak big tree. Just like two gusts of dark wind, they jumped from the high branches onto the iron sheet stacked on the wall.</p><p>“Put this on.”</p><p>In the hidden corner, Tang Xiu took out an Invisible Talisman and handed it to Mo Awu, who was also wearing a night outfit.</p><p>Mo Awu did not even ask Tang Xiu what it was and directly pasted it on his neck, and then whispered, “Boss, this Kangsha Pharmaceutical appears to have only a few security guards on the surface, but there are many people hiding in the dark. The most important thing is that there should be monitoring equipment everywhere. We’ll be discovered unless we dash at full speed.”</p><p>Tang Xiu just smiled in response, patted his shoulder and said in a toned down voice, “Just remember. You must not speak no matter what happens. And don’t make any sound.”</p><p>With that said, he went straight out of the iron sheet under Mo Awu’s gaze. Even though there were four patrolling security guards in the distance holding flashlights, he did not even try to avoid them.</p><p>“This…” Mo Awu’s head was full of confusion, for he could not understand why his Boss was exposing their position. But he still grabbed his sharp dagger and appeared beside Tang Xiu. Once the four security guards rushed at them, he would kill them lightning fast.</p><p>What followed, however, made him dumbfounded.</p><p>The four patrolling security guards just stood in line and looking around, as if they did not see Tang Xiu and him at all, flashing their flashlights while looking around and passing by them. Even after the four security guards disappeared in the distant corner, Mo Awu had still not recovered from his astonishment.</p><p>Tang Xiu only smiled and gently patted his shoulder, then immediately went inside. After walking for several meters forward, he saw a dozen surveillance cameras and then led Mo Awu to swaggeringly waltz in front of the camera.</p><p>“Curse it!”</p><p>Mo Awu gulped down and followed Tang Xiu to pass by the other four security guards, where he subconsciously raised his hand and touched the Invisible Talisman hanging on his chest. Although he was a cultivator with a body filled with power, he did not know any magical spells nor any talisman’s magical functions at all. He wanted to ask about it, but when he recalled Tang Xiu’s warning a while ago, he could only suppress the urge inside.</p><p>Kangsha Pharmaceuticals’ grounds were very large and there were many buildings inside. There were even rows of factories at the rear, while one thing that made Tang Xiu and Mo Awu speechless was that the entrance they just passed through was only the front yard. They continued going deeper without stopping, and finally found the main gate with a line of sentry posts.</p><p>Taking advantage of the time between patrols to enter and exit the second gate, they successfully sneaked through to the third gate sentry and then stopped before the fourth gate sentry.</p><p>“What should we do now?”</p><p>Mo Awu followed Tang Xiu to a remote corner and asked with a voice that only they could hear. There were six security guards standing before the fourth sentry post, but there were no guards coming in and out at all. What made Tang Xiu and Mo Awu speechless was than once they crossed through the fourth sentry post, there was only a corridor cast of steel that went all the way to the entrance of the five-story building with all the windows sealed.</p><p>Tang Xiu had already released his spiritual sense, covering a two hundred plus meters area in the surrounding. Despite wearing an Invisible Talisman and being able to fly, there was no answer he could give Mo Awu.</p><p>“No way to get inside.” Tang Xiu shook his head after observing with his spiritual sense. There was no one else in the entire five-story building but 18 sleeping security guards. According to the intel, Xie Zhiqian came here noon yesterday and had yet to leave, but he could not find him at this time.</p><p>Tang Xiu guessed that there should be an underground lab, but he could not even enter the inside, let alone the underground lab. At a time like this, he did not want to alert the enemies, because he had yet to figure out whether this was only a smoke screen left by Xie Zhiqiang.</p><p>Gene particles were something Tang Xiu regarded as very important, as he did not want to see a change in the power constellation pattern in the world. He did not want to see countless mutated human emerge in the world. In the case the gene particles had any side effects, many people would be harmed by it.</p><p>“Let’s leave! We’ll find another way.”</p><p>Tang Xiu sighed inwardly and grabbed Mo Awu’s shoulder as their figures instantly soared to the sky and flew out of Kangsha Pharmaceuticals in just a few breaths.</p><p>Less than two minutes after, fifteen hazy figures rushed out from the fourth gate sentry. All of them wore full-body black steel armor and helmet, with cold weapons in hands.</p><p>“There’s no one here, Boss.”</p><p>One of the middle-aged men in armor reported through the intercom after searching everywhere for a long time.</p><p>Tens of meters’ deep underground, Xie Zhiqiang sat in front of the monitor as a chilling light flashed in his eyes. The thermal detector would never make a mistake. His subordinate previously reported that it detected two humanoid-shaped energies, which showed that some people had just sneaked inside.</p><p>“Keep searching and find them even if you have to dig deep into the ground!” Said Xie Zhiqiang in a heavy voice.</p><p>****</p><p>A few kilometers away from Kangsha Pharmaceuticals, Tang Xiu and Mo Awu appeared in a residential building. As they entered the apartment, the monkey-like Mouse greeted them with red eyes, “Did you just personally go into action, Boss?”</p><p>“I did, but no gains,” said Tang Xiu. “Xie Zhiqiang has managed to fully seal the entire area of Kangsha Pharmaceuticals, there’s no way to sneak inside. I’ve read all the information from you, and yet we were unable to enter that building installed with the infrared mechanism.”</p><p>“I have yet to gather much information on Xie Zhiqiang. I can tell this man is very cautious and discreet from the intel. He never leaves a tail. Even the data of his last four years of life is forged. We can’t figure it out, so he should have been out of the country during those four years.”</p><p>“Then there’s no need to investigate him for now since you can’t find it.” Tang Xiu nodded and asserted, “Remember, I must get that gene particle. This thing is too horrible, so we must be the ones to get it. Notify your men to move back for two kilometers from the current surveillance perimeter. Do keep in mind, all of our intelligence personnel must not be exposed.”</p><p>“Rest assured, Boss. I’ll definitely execute it,” said Mouse cautiously with a nod.</p><p>Tang Xiu no longer spoke and quickly changed his clothes and left with Mo Awu. This time, he did not head to Paradise Manor but returned directly to Bluestar Villa.</p><p>In the next morning, Tang Xiu left home in great spirits and went to Shanghai University on foot. He hardly studied recently due to being delayed by many things, and he was not prepared to do anything else before the construction project tender bid, hence he would use this tranquil time to learn more things.</p><p>In the library.</p><p>Tang Xiu was quietly reading books on finance and economics. Although the morning class he attended was over already, he always felt that he had forgotten something.</p><p>Bzzz, Bzzz…</p><p>His phone that was set to on vibrate mode suddenly buzzed.</p><p>Tang Xiu took it and looked at the number displayed on the screen, and immediately remembered what he had forgotten. He received a text message from Yuan Chuling this morning, saying that he would come to Shanghai University and that he had something he needed to discuss with him. And the call now was exactly from Yuan Chuling.</p><p>Tang Xiu did not answer it and hung up. After which, he sent a short message to Yuan Chuling saying to wait for him at the Shanghai University’s entrance. Then, he put away the book and took all the books he had selected before to the registration counter. After registering the borrowed books, he headed straight to the entrance of Shanghai University.</p><p>“Wow, you’re doing well, Fatty Yuan! A belle in a great car, eh? Awesomely romantic.” Tang Xiu immediately teased Yuan Chuling the moment he saw him standing by a white Porsche Cayenne while hugging a gentle and slender pretty girl.</p><p>Yuan Chuling released the girl in his embrace the moment he saw Tang Xiu and grinned, “Big Bro, I’m not gonna take your limelight! Besides, from where would I have the capital if you did not invest in me? Anyways, this is Xiaoting, my babe. Xiaoting, this is the Boss I often mentioned to you, my Big Bro, Tang Xiu.”</p><p>Wei Xiaoting gracefully nodded and said, “I’ve heard a lot about you, Tang Xiu.”</p><p>Tang Xiu nodded to her in response and immediately asked Yuan Chuling, “What made you rush here? I’m a good student at the campus, so don’t delay my studies.”</p><p>Yuan Chuling rolled his eyes and snappily said, “If you’re a good student, there will be no bad students under the sky nowadays. I heard a couple days ago that the dignified Big Boss of the Magnificent Tang Corporation who has been studying at Shanghai University for half a year turns out to have appalling attendance.”</p><p>Tang Xiu couldn’t help laughing and asked, “You have contacted Han Qingwu, haven’t you?”</p><p>“Woot, you deserve to be called Boss, Big Bro.” Yuan Chuling grinned. “To think that you’ve actually captured Teacher Han. Anyways, she seems to be quite resentful towards you, though. She said that you’re too busy to have time to please her.”</p><p>“Fuck off!” Tang Xiu cursed. “Just tell me, what the hell are you here for? I’m going back to the library if you keep farting!”</p><p>Yuan Chuling rubbed his hands and smilingly said, “Well, I need some money.”</p><p>“Huh?” Tang Xiu was stunned. “You need some money? What for?”</p><p>“Our fitness center is very hot and popular and earned quite a lot last year. But I’m not going to pay you its dividends for the time being, though. I wanna open another branch, so I took a look at the address. But, the investment needed is kinda big. I already asked 10 million from my old man and, added with the earned money, I only have a total of 16 million now. It’s not enough.”</p><p>“You don’t have enough money, so why are you rushing to open a branch in the first place?” Asked Tang Xiu with a helpless expression.</p><p>“Got no way out, man. I wanna develop this fitness center as my career!” Said Yuan Chuling. “Besides, the location for the new branch is really good. After surveying it, I found it has two neighborhoods nearby, and both of them are upscale residential areas. Firstly, it has a high visitor flow rate and secondly, the rent for the shop is cheap! The owner of that shop was hit by bad luck or something, hence he’s been wanting to rent his store.”</p><p>“How much do you need, then?” Asked Tang Xiu.</p><p>“Three million,” said Yuan Chuling. “But if you have too much money to burn, then add two million more.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
