We should resolve the problem outside first, then we can spare lots of time to find cultivation resources. Don’t worry! I will phone Xiaoxue once we get out. She will bring others over here.”</p><p>Suddenly saw the light, Mo Awu said with a smile, “Poverty was my dread, Boss, please never mind it.”</p><p>Tang Xiu just smiled and said nothing, but he understood Mo Awu’s mentality very well. Speaking of that, it was true that there were not many resources in Banquet Restaurant. Although these days it had been spending much on lots of medicinal materials, precious ore and other cultivation materials through various channels, with a huge turnout of people and a large group of children needed to be educated, the Banquet Restaurant’s resources average per capita was very few.</p><p>Very soon.</p><p>Leaving there, Tang Xiu and others came to the foot of the mountain. After walked out of the white misted area successfully, they took the car and left the mountain. Around half an hour later, since no one was following the track, they drove their four off-road vehicles directly toward Twin Brook City. Take the time, Tang Xiu ate a red fruit, and with its energy blended into his body, the faint hunger disappeared completely. And, due to the lack of sleep for two or three days, he fell asleep gradually.</p><p>“CREAK…”</p><p>The sudden braking sound awakened Tang Xiu in a start, and the inertia made him almost run into the front chair. His brow wrinkled, Tang Xiu glanced ahead and asked, “What’s up?”</p><p>Original translation from Www。WangmamaRead。Com。</p><p>Mo Awu looked over his shoulder and said, “Boss, there are bodies on the roadside. A lot.”</p><p>Tang Xiu stunned, and when he pushed the car door and got off, he suddenly saw dozens of bodies on both sides of the road. Some of the bodies had even rotted, and some were surrounded by bugs, making a buzzing noise.</p><p>“Instead of being killed, they died of the Darkening Virus?”</p><p>Tang Xiu bristled. He had a strong intention to kill the real culprits in the spread of the Darkening Virus – the members in the Stygian Club. He got the news the other day, saying there were several hundred people who died of the Darkening Virus. Although he didn’t see the dead, he was outraged.</p><p>However, at this moment.</p><p>He wished he could try every means to kill all those slaughters who deserved to die immediately if there were any members of the Stygian Club on the scene.</p><p>“Collect their corpses and bury them.”</p><p>After saying that, Tang Xiu returned to his car. He took out one of his cigarettes, lit it and puffed at it. He tried to call Gu Xiaoxue, only to find there was no signal. After thinking for a while, he called Mo Awu, whose Spatial Ring stored some communication equipment that was given by the division commander Yang in the Mist Source Island Military Base.</p><p>Tang Xiu got through Gu Xiaoxue’s phone number with the communication equipment, saying: “Xiaoxue, I’ll send you a coordinate. Bring your own people who specialize in herbs and minerals. We’ve found a treasure mountain, on which there were abundant precious herbs and minerals.”</p><p>“Roger that, master.”</p><p>Gu Xiaoxue replied.</p><p>Thinking about it, Tang Xiu asked: “How is Yan’er now?”</p><p>Gu Xiaoxue said: “Master stays in the exquisite pagoda every day to heal herself. She comes out for a walk once in a while. Don’t worry, master’s condition is good and she is expected to recover in two years.”</p><p>Tang Xiu continued: “That’s good. Tell her to stay in the Banquet Restaurant. I’m now out on an important task, and I’m not sure for the time being when I can handle this matter. When you bring someone over, you will understand the situation here. Please tell Yan’er that when I’m done with business here, I will go directly to Jingmen Island. ”</p><p>“OK.”</p><p>After hanging up the phone, Tang Xiu took two more cigarettes in a row, meanwhile, Mo Awu and other people buried dozens of bodies. Here was in the middle of nowhere, thus the surrounding environment was so silent that it even seemed terrible.</p><p>However.</p><p>Not long after their cars started, two racing cars roared up the road. The speed of the two cars was very fast, reaching almost one hundred and eighty miles per hour. After they saw the four off-road vehicles, they even had no intention to slow down. On the contrary, when the deafening metal music was approaching, the speed of those racing cars increased a lot instead.</p><p>Arrogant!</p><p>Crazy!</p><p>The most shocking thing was that on the roof of the headmost car, a person was tied with ropes there, who looked like a child.</p><p>“Stop them.”</p><p>Tang Xiu’s eyes turned cold and shouted in a deep voice.</p><p>All of a sudden, Mo Awu turned the steering wheel and immediately shifted down to the side, driving abreast with the back off-road vehicle. Then Mo Awu lowered the window, asked Ye Shisan to stop his car.</p><p>“Creak…”</p><p>With a sudden brake, two cars a hundred meters away stopped at a distance of more than ten meters from the off-road vehicle that Tang Xiu was in. At this moment, Tang Xiu could clearly see that a teenage girl was tied on the top of the car. The little girl was ragged and bloodstained.</p><p>“Still alive?”</p><p>Tang Xiu’s pupils constricted abruptly, and he slammed the car door behind, seeing the seven or eight burly men who jumped out of the two cars coming toward him, the rage in his heart was accumulating wildly.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
