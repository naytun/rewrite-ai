With a straightforward and pleasant personality, she could hang around men unperturbed, but she was still shocked by Tang Xiu’s words, and her sensual lips opened wide.</p><p>“What the hell is going on here?” Yu Hong turned around with difficulty to look at Han Qingwu.</p><p>The latter could not help but laugh and cover her mouth. She never thought that Tang Xiu’s mouth turned out to be this amazing, as his lightly said statement made her good sister overwhelmed and helpless.</p><p>As a smart woman, Yu Hong finally realized that she was just teased by Tang Xiu upon seeing Han Qingwu’s expression. She looked rather heated up, she snapped at her, “Bah, whoever looks good does really have nothing good. Anyways, you gotta be careful with this fella, Qingwu. He’s probably the kind who would give up his love whenever he sees someone pretty.”</p><p>Han Qingwu was stabbed right at the heart and the smile on her face retreated like a tidal wave. She glanced at Tang Xiu without being noticed, immediately grabbed Yu Hong’s hand and said, “Oh, shut it. Don’t be ridiculous. Anyways, I’m starving. Let’s find someplace to grab a bite!”</p><p>Yu Hong rolled her eyes in response and grinned, “Qingwu, why don’t we have a meal while watching something fun? There will a big event happening in Changxi City today and… it’s about time for it to start.”</p><p>“What big event?” Asked Han Qingwu, looking confused.</p><p>Yu Hong only chuckled in a mystifying manner while dragging her away. Since Yu Hong came on her car, they drove the two cars to an upscale restaurant in Changxi. After parking the cars, the trio then headed to the second floor and sat by the window facing the street.</p><p>“Alright. You order the dishes, Qingwu. I can't miss the good play today, so I’m gonna take a look.” Yu Hong straightly pushed the menu towards Han Qingwu while playfully looking at street below.</p><p>Tang Xiu was not someone who liked to gossip, yet his curiosity was piqued by Yu Hong’s mystifyingness. He could not bear to have his eyes involuntarily look at the outside as well.</p><p>Oh? After a short two or three minutes, his eyes suddenly focused on a certain spot where several young men were at, and looking precisely toward their leader.</p><p>Ji Mu? Isn’t this way too coincidental? He seemed to be a local of Changxi when I met him, but I never thought I would see him here.</p><p>“Well, the good show is about to begin, guys.”</p><p>Yu Hong pulled Han Qingwu to her side, and then leaned close to the window and looked downstairs. She looked excited with an expression of anticipation and eagerness as she waited for the show.</p><p>“Don’t keep me guessing, Honghong. Just what exactly is this good show that you talked about?” Asked Han Qingwu as her curiosity was also ignited.</p><p>“Just be patient, will you?” And yet, Yu Hong was still mystifying it.</p><p>VROOM…. (SCREECH…)</p><p>On the street outside the restaurant, eight extravagant sedans roared and stopped in front of the restaurant’s entrance with sudden braking. Each of the sedans was different in color and brand, but common in being expensive.</p><p>Bam, bam…</p><p>Those eight supercars’ doors were pushed open as more than 20 people in black leather attire got off carrying different banners, balloons, flowers, champagnes, ribbons, and streamers. The two empty-handed women then ran toward the fourth supercar and opened the door.</p><p>A very beautiful girl in a white bridal gown and holding a large bouquet of red roses, whose age about twenty-four or twenty-five, then got off from the car, taking a megaphone handed by someone and loudly shouting, “JI MU, COME OUT! IT’S REN RANRAN HERE!”</p><p>Inside the restaurant.</p><p>Ji Mu, who was just about to walk upstairs, suddenly trembled after hearing the loud shout. The smile on his handsome was uglier than crying. He glared at his buddies behind him and angrily yelled, “Who the hell sold me out? Else, how would she know that I’m here?”</p><p>“Err, my phone is connected with my wife’s with a GPS tracker. She knows that I’m having lunch with you today,” said a young after letting out a hollow laugh.</p><p>“To hell with your phone!”</p><p>Ji Mu really wanted to run from this place right now, but he found that people were looking at him with a curious gaze whether they were upstairs or downstairs, and was immediately struck with a huge headache. This Ren Ranran, precisely the Beautiful Princess Ren, was the most famous girl in Changxi, and the very girl who struck him with a headache the most.</p><p>The young man behind him chuckled and grinned, “Brother Ji, the Beauty Ren has come to find you, so you should not hide from her, no? Just meet her and firmly state your rejection if you don’t feel a thing at all towards her.”</p><p>“You knew this farce was going to happen today, didn’t you?” Ji Mu was baffled and stared blankly before asking.</p><p>The young man laughed inwardly. A lot of people knew this was going to happen today, except this guy. Even his buddies lent a hand for this to happen today, along with his wife’s sisters who helped had planned it for a long time. Nevertheless, he would never admit it in front of Ji Mu even if he had to die, so the young man said, “I really knew nothing about it, man. Else, given the camaraderie between us brothers, I would have already informed you about it already, no?”</p><p>Ji Mu’s response was to roll his eyes at him, before he gritted his teeth and walked downstairs. When he came outside and saw the lines of troops ready for battle outside, fright suddenly overwhelmed him and he snappily shouted, “What the hell are you doing, Ranran? Do you want to make a ruckus or something?”</p><p>Ren Ranran simply ignored his words as she walked towards Ji Mu while holding the rose bouquet, and then seriously said, “You never proposed to me Ji Mu, so I’ll take the role myself. We both can drag this on and on, but the child in my belly cannot afford it. Promise to marry me!”</p><p>A child?</p><p>Ji Mu seemed to be struck by a thunderbolt, striking and scorching his soft side while he stood silly on the spot. He could clearly recall what happened two months ago after he had a drink in some leisure club. He happened to bump into Ren Ranran who were also drinking there. Finally, the two tables were joined. It was at that very night that he got a bit drunk got he got muddle headed and was deceived to make her pregnant.</p><p>He dared to call the Heavens to witness that he was absolutely in the dark, not knowing what had happened. He only knew that when he woke up the next day, he saw Ren Ranran sleeping in his embrace stark naked, and then realized that he just got done in by her. He did not give it a thought at that time because he felt that he did not suffer any loss. After all, there had been quite a few women he had played with before.</p><p>But who would have thought that Ren Ranran regularly ran over to find him ever since that time? It had been half a month since he started hiding from her, and was afraid to go out casually. And yet, he had made her pregnant because of what happened between them more than two months ago?</p><p>This… was… simply… impossible!</p><p>On the second floor, by the window.</p><p>Tang Xiu let out a faint smile while looking at Ji Mu below, and his smile was getting particularly thicker. Even Yu Hong, who was pulling Han Qingwu, whispered, “What a rare sight. This man is just hit by luck in love. It’s darn extraordinary. The dignified Young Master of the Ji Family of Changxi was actually proposed to by a woman. Damn! This will definitely become a sensation in the whole city, a big scandal people when it’s known by everyone! Speaking about it, though, this Ren Ranran deserves my kudos. She rarely shows what she’s made of normally. Who would have thought that she had such a bold attitude and even revealed that she is with a baby already?”</p><p>“This drama is a marvel indeed.” Han Qingwu echoed with a nod. “I got used to seeing men who proposed to women, but today is the reverse, it’s the woman’s turn to propose. So, what do you do you think, will Ji Mu accept?”</p><p>With that said, she deliberately glanced at Tang Xiu.</p><p>Tang Xiu was keenly aware that Han Qingwu was glancing at him, and was secretly speechless inside while thinking: we are just bystanders who are just passively watching the drama unfold, why the hell is she looking at me?</p><p>After thinking about it, Tang Xiu just replied casually without thinking much, “I bet Ji Mu won’t accept.”</p><p>Yu Hong and Han Qingwu shifted their gazes at the same time. Their expressions were different, however. Yu Hong looked puzzled, while Han Qingwu looked a bit complicated.</p><p>“Why?” Asked Yu Hong with a curious expression.</p><p>Naturally, Tang Xiu could not tell her that Ji Mu had just obtained a cultivation technique from him. At this time, cultivation was the most important thing to this guy. How could he possibly delay his own great undertaking for women and children? However, under Yu Hong’s curious gaze, he could only laugh and said, “Why asking why? There’s no reason why, to be honest. Leaving aside the misconception that ‘it’s easier for a man to chase a woman than the other way around’, Ji Mu may have had sex with this woman and made her pregnant, but I don’t think he has much love for her. Otherwise, she shouldn’t be the one proposing to him, but the other way around.”</p><p>“What you said does hold a bit of truth,” commented Yu Hong with a pensive look. “Though Ji Mu is not lascivious, he did have some girls before. Given his status and personality, he will never waver even if 100 women were to propose him unless he really loved her. But I think your guess is wrong, however.”</p><p>Tang Xiu blanked for a moment and asked, “Why are you so sure about that?”</p><p>“The Ji Family is an aristocratic family, a very notable one in Changxi and definitely one of the best prominent families here,” explained Yu Hong. “But the Ren Family, on the other hand, also has a very strong root here, and the second figure in Changxi is the younger brother of the current head of the family, Ren Ranran’s biological uncle. For the sake of the two family’s faces and reputations, Ji Mu will not refuse her in public. At the most, he will privately discuss it with her.”</p><p>Tang Xiu gave it a thought, yet he still shook his head and said, “I still stand on my opinion. He won’t agree.”</p><p>“How about having a bet between us then?” said Yu Hong with a smile.</p><p>“What bet?” Asked Tang Xiu.</p><p>Yu Hong pondered for a while, before suddenly grinning and saying, “If I win, you gotta propose to my sister, Qingwu. How about it?”</p><p>Tang Xiu rolled his eyes at her. Though he felt that she did hit his weak point, he still asked, “But what if you lose?”</p><p>“What if I lose?” Yu Hong looked in disbelief. “How could I possibly lose?”</p><p>“Unforeseen things may happen at any time,” said Tang Xiu indifferently.</p><p>Yu Hong hesitated and then seriously replied, “I’ll hold a big banquet to treat you and Han Qingwu. I got no problem with treating you for a full month.”</p><p>Banquet?</p><p>Tang Xiu rolled his eyes at her and snappily said, “Hey, what you said is so worlds apart that only you can mesh it up. But since you want to gamble, then so be it. Let’s wait and see! I say Ji Mu will refuse Ren Ranran in front of everyone in less than three minutes.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
