That’s right. I just had a new idea, we might as well experiment with it before those herbs are found and sent to you.”</p><p>“Please do say…”</p><p>Gui Jianchou explained his thoughts, and the duo immediately started to experiment. After a failure, they kept brainstorming, unceasingly doing experiments, proposing new ideas and continuing testing them and meeting failures.</p><p>Time passed by.</p><p>The continuous research drained the duo, and as a cultivator, Tang Xiu was able to carry on the longtime research. But Gui Jianchou was quite old, and despite having paid attention to the training of his body all these years, he still had to stop due to fatigue. He then went to the next room to sleep for several hours.</p><p>In the next afternoon.</p><p>Statistics on the deaths of the infected in Misty Source Island had been made. The number of infected who had died had increased to 562. At the moment the data was sent to Tang Xiu, Mo Awu returned with the herbs needed.</p><p>“All the herbs have been found, Boss.”</p><p>Mo Awu put two suitcases in front of Tang Xiu and then wiped off the sweat on his forehead.</p><p>Tang Xiu nodded and immediately began to refine the medicine. After refining for several hours, he successfully concocted a jet black pill. Under Divine Doctor Gui Jianchou’s gaze, he grounded the pill and then sprinkled its powder on the carrion. This time, the carrion did not appear to decay and immediately festered, and yet, it still had little to no effect on the virus.</p><p>“I just found a black line on the carrion after you poured your medicine powder on it, Little Tang. I used a magnifying glass to observe it, and it turns out that it’s composed of countless very tiny active particles. It seems like they are alive. From the Western medicine perspective, it can be called as a bacterium,” said Gui Jianchou slowly.</p><p>Tang Xiu thought about it for a while. A bright idea suddenly birthed inside his head and he hurriedly said, “If it’s bacteria, or rather, viral bacteria, there are many ways to sterilize it. We can consider sterilizing it by using electric current.”</p><p>“Sterilizing it by using electric current?”</p><p>Gui Jianchou was stunned. He suddenly recalled something and then immediately said, “There was an eccentric doctor in Northeast China 42 years ago. He was called Gao Yitong and invented this electric current sterilization method, using static electricity to encircle and suppress viral bacteria with the aid of alcohol and moxa-stick. He eventually succeeded in creating this very special method after his study, and even though only few people use this method in reality, it has been spread to some mountainous areas of the Northeast Region since. I say let’s try it.”</p><p>“Let’s try it, then!”</p><p>Tang Xiu did think of doing it. What surprised him was that the after the next carrion was brought and the static electricity method was used on it, the black lines on the carrion continued to burn, turning into a black smoke with pungent stench, while the piece of carrion gradually turned bright. Through the following study of Gui Jianchou and Tang Xiu, it was found that the viral bacteria was unexpectedly suppressed.</p><p>“It does have an effect on it. But the fission speed at which the viral bacteria grow is too fast. Although this static electricity method can kill a large number of these viral bacteria, it will still be difficult to completely eradicate it. We can temporarily allay the death predicament for the infected by electrifying them. We can use this as a temporary suppressing action,” said Gui Jianchou excitedly.</p><p>“We need to find a living experiment. Also, it’s necessary to generate static electricity into the human body without harming their health. Only then can we try to use it on all infected persons,” Tang Xiu nodded.</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>There were four commonly used methods in generating static electricity, which was electric charge migration, breaking electrification, induction electrification, and contact-induced charge separation. Among them, the most suitable method to be used on a large number of people was contact-induced charge separation by using objects made of chemical fiber texture such as underwear, carpet, cushion, or wallpaper, whereby static electricity would be generated and induced after the contact and separation.</p><p>Furthermore, household appliances also generated static electricity when used, or passed static electricity to its outer casing, such as TV screens or LCD.</p><p>Huff…</p><p>After studying this temporarily curbing plan, Tang Xiu did not hesitate to report the situation to Yang Chuxiong. After relaying the broadcast on TV, radio, and texts to mobile phones, the soldiers in the camp then rushed everywhere to spread the news…</p><p>The third night after Tang Xiu landed on Mist Source Island, the virus crisis had been temporarily solved, while numerous people who were dying finally hung on the death line.</p><p>The terrain of Mist Source Island had only four areas suitable for living, which were inhabited by the people who lived here for decades. There were also some villages on the hills, which, according to the official statistics, numbered up to 24 villages. Each village was inhabited by several hundreds of people at the lowest to several thousand people at the highest.</p><p>Python City, Wolfpack City, Twin Brook City, and Mixed Summit City.</p><p>The population of these four major urban areas, with the largest being Python City with 100-200 thousand inhabitants and the smallest one being Mixed Summit City with only 7-8 thousand people. After decades of development, all four cities were now connected with many main roads, dozens of small roads, and mountain roads.</p><p>Mixed Summit City.</p><p>Traveling along the road was rows and lines of the neat and orderly hamlet and village buildings. The bustling commercial streets here were almost no different from the urban areas in the outside world. Though the place was placed under strict concealment, the state had been supporting it secretly, hence the continuous commodity and supplies shipped from the outside. The inhabitants who lived here not only had their foodstuffs provided by the government, but were also able to gather herbs, find minerals and other resources, and many even had their own private factories.</p><p>On a certain street in the north of the city.</p><p>Dozens hardened robust men in suits crowded inside the five buildings, while many people came from various places and entered the five buildings in a rush.</p><p>In the middle of the building, a high-ranking member of the Stygian Club, Keith Moore, was smoking the world’s top Cuban cigar and sipped a delicious coffee while listening to a report from his confidant.</p><p>“The result of our investigation is that the person who invented the electrostatic treatment is called Tang Xiu. From our intel data, he’s the secret Boss of the Magnificent Tang Corporation in China and is also hailed as the Young Divine Doctor of the Chinese traditional medical field. We have yet to investigate how he came to Mist Source Island. Furthermore, the electrostatic sterilization treatment can only temporarily suppress the virus, but he has yet to find a way to have it under control. As the matter stands, it could be said that he has helped our cause a lot,” reported the thin middle-aged man.</p><p>Keith Moore’s eyes shimmered. He nodded and said, “You’re right. We are the ones who brought the virus, but completely eradicating all the humans on this island is not our purpose. We did that just to destroy some people and then take control of a large number of people through their fear, so we can free them and drive them to work for us. Only, there’s something problematic with the environment of this place that affects the multiplication of the virus outbreak and finally made it out of our control. The arrival of this Tang Xiu is actually a relief for us.”</p><p>“So, what should we do now, Sir?” asked the middle-aged man.</p><p>“Assign some assassination agents to abduct this Tang Xiu,” Keith Moore touched his chin and coldly said. “He has an amazing talent given that he can think of this electrostatic sterilization method. Perhaps, he can be of some use for us later. Furthermore, we must not relax our investigation of the mountain ranges around Mixed Summit City. We have only prospected a small lithium mine here. The more mineral resources we find from the survey, the bigger the harvest we can get from the Chinese government when we negotiate with them.”</p><p>“Understood. I’ll arrange it immediately. However, what should we do if Tang Xiu refuses and resists us?” asked the middle-aged man.</p><p>“Don’t kill him even if he resists,” said Keith Moore. “He just needs a short time to find a way to suppress this Darkening Virus. So I’m sure he can develop a new type of Darkening Virus antidote. We will need a new Darkening Virus antidote after the negotiation with the Chinese government later.”</p><p>“I understand,” said the lean middle-aged man as he turned around and left.</p><p>Keith Moore’s eyes followed the back of the middle-aged man as he left. Then, he clapped his hands as two young men in black trench overcoats and pale skin appeared in front of him.</p><p>“The two of you will follow the Darksoul team. This Tang Xiu has an extraordinary identity and I believe the Chinese military will protect him. You will take over if the assassination fails.”</p><p>“Understood!”</p><p>The two young men replied and their figures instantly disappeared.</p><p>The valley dozens of kilometers south of Twin Brook City was a place of verdant and lush vegetation, with fresh wildflowers and animals everywhere. It was a picture of vibrant biological life compared to the heavy death qi and bleak atmosphere in Twin Brook City. And at present, there were dozens of army tents built there.</p><p>A dark-skinned, foreign old man in a black tuxedo and with a walking stick made of gold was standing on a slope on the south side of the army tents.</p><p>Behind him were two men and two women donned in black leather fur coats with sinister auras exuding from their bodies—existences that were out of line with the vibrant scene in the valley. Even some of the wild animals were avoiding them.</p><p>“Siou, how is the deployment of the virus gene conversion agents?” The foreign old man suddenly asked.</p><p>The man on the far left behind him replied in a moderate and somewhat hoarse voice, “There’s only the last step left. We can expect to have it mixed successfully within three days.”</p><p>The foreign old man nodded and then said, “This fella called Tang Xiu does have some skills, much more capable than that group of idiots led by Keith Moore. Now that our Pyramid organization has set our feet here, we’ll ruin the plans and scheme of the Stygian Club, hence we must be ready to have a full frontal clash with them. Send some men to harass and create troubles for them. They want to do some prospecting for mineral deposits here, but we will not let them do as they wish.”</p><p>“I’ll go and manage it at once,” said Siou respectfully.</p><p>The foreign old man touched his chin and said, “After conveying my order, you will immediately lead some men to kill this Tang Xiu. He thought of and found the method to temporarily suppress the Darkening Virus. It may be a relief for us, but we must not let him find the means to fully cure the Darkening Virus and neither let him be caught by those Stygian Club’s bastards.”</p><p>“Let me do it alone, Sir!” said Siou with a hideous grin.</p><p>Hmph. The foreign old man hummed coldly and said, “There’s an old adage in China: ‘Caution is the parent of safety’. You’re a capable man, I admit. But don’t let your arrogance rob you of your life.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
