Why is that?” Asked Tang Xiu.</p><p>“Shanjenna used to be my student, a very kind hearted soul, not crafty nor evil,” said Han Jintong. “I did not know that she was a Bloodkin then, I only thought that she was a genius in martial arts. Only until she got hunted down and ran to China yesterday did I finally learn her true identity.”</p><p>“Then, you’re still adamant on saving her despite knowing she’s one of the Bloodkin?” Continued Tang Xiu with a pensive look.</p><p>“As long as she’s not wicked, I will still save regardless of who she is,” said Han Jintong seriously. “Of course, what is most important is that she was once my student.”</p><p>Appreciation flashed in Tang Xiu’s eyes. He had seen myriads of alien races when he was in the Immortal World, hence there was no distinction of races in his eyes, only good or evil. But for Han Jintong, as a very weak cultivator, to have this kind of understanding was admirable.</p><p>“So, tell me why she’s being hunted down.”</p><p>Han Jintong was about to reply, but was interrupted by Grove Bear’s rough voice.</p><p>At this time, a flame of anger suffused in Grove Bear’s eyes, along with burning killing intent when he glared at Tang Xiu. Little did he think that he would be ignored outright, even his question was utterly dismissed. He was an assassination agent, one of whom had a strength feared by countless people. Even his position in the Stygian Club was also honored.</p><p>“Damn Orientals. I got words for you. DO NOT meddle in others’ business, else you’ll die!”</p><p>Finally, Tang Xiu slowly turned his head toward him, and then indifferently said, “There are only two kinds of fate for the people who threaten me. The first one is to beg for mercy, and the other is death. Which one do you want to choose?”</p><p>“Do you really want to stand up for them?” Roared Grove Bear furiously.</p><p>“Yup. I will stand for them.” Tang Xiu coldly smiled. “What can you do to me?”</p><p>“ATTACK! KILL THEM!” Roared Grove Bear in a heavy tone.</p><p>The two Wingmen flapped their wings, pulled out their Darkfiend Artefacts and streaked toward Tang Xiu, while the vampire and the Beastmen stormed over toward Jin Shi and the others. After so many battles, cutting men down was like cutting hemp for them, resulting in vicious killing auras after countless killings.</p><p>“KILL!”</p><p>A cold voice spat out from Tang Xiu’s mouth as Jin Shi and the other nine men instantly moved. The strongest among them was at the Foundation Establishment Stage, but they were also seasoned powerhouses who had gone through various battles. More so that they were also armed with spirit weapons, their flying swords, and were able to suppress the five Silver Badge assassination agents in just a few breaths.</p><p>Mo Awu soared to the air, wielding a dagger backhandedly, and stormed over Grove Bear. He also released the flying sword to hover around him and posed a huge, looming threat to Grove Bear.</p><p>Tang Xiu did not move, but lowered his head to look at Han Jintong and said, “You haven’t told me the reason yet.”</p><p>Han Jintong retracted his eyes from the fierce combat scene and started explained everything from the beginning to the end of what Shanjenna had told him. In the end, there was anger and hatred in his tone and expression as he concluded, “I’m not a superman who can save the world, neither am I a God who safeguard the world peace, but I loathe and abhor their inhuman actions. Let alone that this concerns the safety of my own student, so I must stand up.”</p><p>A murderous light flashed in Tang Xiu’s eyes. He suddenly turned around and shouted, “Awu, get back.”</p><p>Upon hearing Tang Xiu’s command, Mo Awu, who was in a mortal combat against Grove Bear, controlled his flying swords to hack Grove Bear and returned back to the front of Tang Xiu in just two breaths.</p><p>At this time, his arm was wounded and bleeding, but Grove Bear’s abdomen and back were bleeding from horribly torn open wounds.</p><p>Tang Xiu stared at Grove Bear and asked in a deep voice, “Are you really affiliated with the Stygian Club?”</p><p>Dread and fear had birthed in Grove Bear’s heart after fighting against Mo Awu. But when he heard Tang Xiu’s question, his momentum immediately climbed up, and then he shouted, “You already know that we are from the Stygian Club, yet you even dare to provoke us? Are you not afraid of retaliation from our Stygian Club?”</p><p>Tang Xiu did not answer with his mouth, but took out the black spear in an instant and his body personally shot forward. His speed was several times faster than Mo Awu’s as he appeared before Grove Bear in almost an instant. For Tang Xiu who lived in the Immortal World for 10,000 years, having command of 18 types of weapons was something not worth noting, as he could even use 18,000 weapons at once with ease.</p><p>Grove Bear could only see a black spear that was as though a black dragon that hovered around his body, undulating under Tang Xiu’s mind control as it blasted through his chest and instantly destroyed his heart.</p><p>“Terra Celestial Bastille!”</p><p>In the wake of the spear’s afterimages that shrouded Grove Bear, Tang Xiu took out more than a dozen pieces of jades at the same time. His fingers then frantically outlined an array pattern and controlled each piece of jade to fill each node of the array. In a flash a moment later, he released his Primal Chaos Force to arrange and activate the array, causing Grove Bear to be confined inside the “Terra Celestial Bastille”.</p><p>“All of you, draw back!”</p><p>Tang Xiu no longer paid attention to the heavily mauled Grove Bear. His figure dashed like lightning and swept away his spear to directly smash the wings of the two Wingmen, as he then shot the spear toward the lone vampire. The other two Beastmen vomited blood repeatedly a few seconds after getting struck with his strike blast, as Tang Xiu eventually kicked them into the Terra Celestial Bastille.</p><p>“What a strength!”</p><p>A shocked expression appeared on Han Jintong’s face as he looked at Tang Xiu. He already knew that Tang Xiu had a very formidable strength, yet never did he expect that Tang Xiu was terrifying to this degree. One must know that he was also a cultivator, and despite being at the Qi Refining Stage, 100 martial arts grandmasters were not his match at all. But still, he was not able to defeat a single Silver Badge assassin, let alone Grove Bear who was a Golden Badge assassin.</p><p>However, such a frightening powerhouse like Grove Bear could not withstand even a single blow from Tang Xiu. How strong was he?</p><p>Next to him, Shanjenna dumbfoundedly watched the invincible might displayed by Tang Xiu. It was like she was seeing Steve Cain, the strongest powerhouse of the Bloodkin. In her mind, only the Prince-rank, Lord Steve Cain, could be compared to Tang Xiu.</p><p>At the same time the shock struck her, however, ecstasy also filled her heart since the stronger Tang Xiu was, the safer she and the professor would be. Because, at this time, she had already seen that this terrifying lord in front of her was an acquaintance of the professor.</p><p>“Be praise to the Great Fisher of Souls! Thank you for sending us our savior.” Shanjenna piously made a gesture of the highest etiquette of the Bloodkin.</p><p>Tang Xiu dragged the two Wingmen and threw them into the Terra Celestial Bastille like garbage. He did not have the slightest pity toward these ruthless butchers.</p><p>Grove Bear covered his chest as desperation filled his eyes. He had imagined Tang Xiu’s strength, a very young normal human who could not possibly have such a terrifying strength at such a young age, the reason why he dared to move.</p><p>And yet, his estimation on Tang Xiu’s strength was gravely mistaken and finally ended up this miserable. Else, as assassin, he would have dragged his five men to flee and escape.</p><p>Tang Xiu treaded on the air as he looked at Han Jintong and asked, “How are you going to deal with them if I hand them over to you?”</p><p>Abhorrence filled Han Jintong’s eyes as he decisively said, “I’ll kill them, for it means that countless people will be saved from them.”</p><p>Tang Xiu nodded in response. With a wave of his hand, a flame was directly produced, and in almost an instant, the flame surrounded the area around the Terra Celestial Bastille, roasting the six assassination agents inside.</p><p>“YOU DAMN BASTARD! JUST GIVE US AN EASY DEATH!”</p><p>Grove Bear could only endure for a few minutes. Getting burned by such intense heat finally made him roar furiously.</p><p>Still, Tang Xiu ignored him, and instead turned to look at Han Jintong and said, “Killing them is too easy for them, I think. It’s better to make them taste endless pain and torture. We can still kill them when their spirits have collapsed.”</p><p>After saying that, he gently waved his hand as the burning flame instantly disappeared without a trace, was replaced by a biting cold current. Countless silvery ice needles constantly pierced into the Terra Celestial Bastille. Intense heat and chilling frost took turns to unceasingly make Grove Bear and the other severely wounded five Silver Badge assassins taste pain that nearly drove them insane. But as atrocious and vicious as they were, they could still endure it.</p><p>Han Jintong gaped upon seeing the scene in front of his eyes. He felt like his whole being was inside a dream, for this kind of scene could only be seen in Xianxia movies, and yet, it now appeared in front of him. Seeing this scene made his spirit surge up and his heartbeat to rapidly soar.</p><p>It was shocking! A shock that could never be replicated!</p><p>Once in the past, he imagined that he could display all sorts of magical arts the likes of abilities the Gods could perform, and would one day become a very formidable cultivator. He also felt that he was formidable enough after he reached the Peak Qi Refining Stage, and thought that nobody under the heaven could be stronger than him.</p><p>But after knowing Tang Xiu and having been hunted down in the last two days, he finally realized that he was like a frog looking at the sky in the bottom of a well. His vision was too shallow and small, while Tang Xiu was like the true celestial being!</p><p>“If… if I can learn magical arts and become stronger, then…” A strong desire ignited inside his chest.</p><p>After a long period of time, Tang Xiu looked at pained six assassins, and a smile finally appeared on his handsome face, as he said, “Alright. I’ll give you a chance to live, but you must tell me something. I’ll let you go if you beg for mercy. So, how about it? Do you want it?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
