Even the outside knew that his woman was Mu Wanying, he never admitted it personally. At this moment, the father and daughter exchanged looks and finally accepted Kang Xia thoroughly.</p><p>Also, she was a cultivator!</p><p>Her status as a cultivator showed that she was indeed Tang Xiu’s most effective assistant. At this moment, the both of them realized that it was no wonder Tang Xiu could transfer his authority over the Magnificent Tang Corporation’s management to Kang Xia.</p><p>“Little Kang, you will be the future daughter-in-law of my Tang Family.”</p><p>Tang Guosheng turned his head to look at Kang Xia. After saying those words, he directly turned his sight to Tang Xiu and took the cigarette Tang Xiu put down on the tea table.</p><p>The daughter-in-law of the Tang Family?</p><p>A huge wave surged up inside Kang Xia’s heart at this moment, and her tender body could not help but tremble a few times. Intense ecstasy along with joy made her feel more satisfied than ever. She cared a lot about Tang Xiu, and naturally, cared about getting approval from the Tang Family’s elders. She imagined about it sometimes, but did not expect her dream to come true.</p><p>External variables were sometimes needed to deepen one’s affection, and those who wanted to love and be loved would truly care. What Tang Xiu just said really made her satisfied, deepening her feelings for him.</p><p>Tang Guosheng lit up the cigarette and took two deep puffs. Then, he slowly said, “The issue is very troublesome this time. It can be said to be big trouble. It will not only cause losses in the entirety of China but also inflict heavy losses to the Tang Family if it’s not handled well.”</p><p>“Please don’t keep me guessing, Grandpa. Just go straight to the point,” said Tang Xiu.</p><p>“Do you know about Mist Source Island?” Asked Tang Guosheng.</p><p>“Never heard of it,” Tang Xiu shook his head. “Do we have such an island in China?”</p><p>“Prior to this, I thought it was a good thing that the country tried to conceal the existence of this island. But I didn’t expect for this situation to occur. As a matter of fact, Mist Source Island suddenly appeared about 20 to 30 years ago outside the sea territory of Taiwan—about 800 nautical miles from it. The moment this island appeared, the country immediately dispatched a large number of troops, geologists, and biologists there. Do you know what situation we found on this island of the same size of Taiwan?</p><p>“It’s completely composed of high mountains, which are filled with virgin primeval forests. There were many savage beasts there at first, along with a lot of precious mineral treasures. Even medicinal herbs also grew there. After some highly respected old Chinese practitioners ventured there, they confirmed that some of the herbs were thousands of years of age. I myself personally went there. And on the summit of the mountain in the center of the island has a palace. It’s very ancient, but none was able to climb up to the mountaintop and venture into it until now.</p><p>“After the country set up development of the island in secret, the Mist Source Island has been completely under our country’s control and a lot of elite soldiers are stationed there, along with the families of some soldiers and researchers for some time in the past. And now, the entire Mist Source Island is inhabited by hundreds of thousands of people.”</p><p>Having said that, Tang Guosheng stopped and took another cigarette.</p><p>Tang Xiu was shocked, “How is it possible for Mist Source Island to still be kept tightly confidential in this era? Without mentioning other reasons, the power of the media alone is enough to expose the situation there, right?”</p><p>“It’s because of the exposure of the existence of Mist Source Island that many countries are staring,” sighed Tang Guosheng. “Many countries attempted to take possession of the island several years ago. But our country has already troops stationed there, while it’s also still in our sea territory, hence the failure of their attempts. Taiwan also wanted to set foot there, but they were suppressed and eventually could only choose to be silent.”</p><p>“If so, then what exactly is this crisis?” Asked Tang Xiu.</p><p>While suppressing his anger, Tang Guosheng replied, “Those foreign countries have always coveted Mist Source Island and even tried every means available to send people there, but there no major issues occurred since the coastline is always guarded very strictly. In recent years, however, some of those countries have been supporting forces to carry out an intense infiltration into the island. What’s more, several people of these foreign forces are now really infiltrating through the flaws in the barricade, and the number is not small.</p><p>“Just six days ago, a resident of Mist Source Island suddenly fell into a coma. After getting examined by medical personnel there, they found that it was caused by a virus and the infected had contacted many people everywhere before. Hence, the contagion of the virus unceasingly spread out at an extremely terrifying speed. In just day four, 80% of the inhabitants of Mist Source Island were infected. Even the garrison there got infected today. All of them amount up to hundreds of thousands of people! Though the country sent the best virus experts there in the last few days, they were still helpless with the situation. Finally, yesterday the senior Divine Doctor Gui Jianchou from Beijing also went there.”</p><p>“From where did this virus come from?” Asked Tang Xiu with a frown.</p><p>“From one of the most dangerous organizations in the world, the Stygian Club,” said Tang Guosheng in a deep voice. “Some people from the Stygian Club infiltrated the island and injected the virus into the first carrier. Some foreign black markets overseas are selling the antivirus, called as strengthening liquid or something. Those who have been injected with this strengthening liquid in advance won’t be infected by the virus again. Therefore, thousands of people from the Stygian Club and some other forces have landed on Mist Source Island in the last seven days. The stationed troops have had several fierce clashes with those people and we suffered quite a few losses as a result. There are some individuals among those people who are very powerful.”</p><p>Tang Xiu slammed his fist on the table and angrily said, “That damn Stygian Club again. Its existence is nothing but a scourge!”</p><p>“You know about the Stygian Club?” Asked Tang Guosheng with fixed attention.</p><p>A cold glint flashed in Tang Xiu’s eyes as he said, “I dealt with people from the Stygian Club in some incidents, and they suffered a loss against me every time. Grandpa, you want me to go to Mist Source Island?”</p><p>“I did have such a plan. But the current situation over there is very dangerous,” Tang Guosheng nodded. “There’s a virus threat on the one hand, while various forces from abroad are also staring their greedy eyes as well. I’m also worried ab…”</p><p>“You can cast away those worries, Grandpa,” Tang Xiu interrupted his words and said with solemnity. “This virus is nothing but a trivial thing, it won’t harm me whatsoever. As for those foreign forces, they will never be able to pose any threats to me unless they use a nuke.”</p><p>Tang Guosheng nodded in response without speaking. Then, he bitterly said, “There are some people of our family on Mist Source Island, a battalion of martial artists in the military training camp I ordered your Second Grandpa to secretly set up on the island. Contact the people under the country’s First Leader when you get there, and then quietly go to the Tang Manor Martial School to find Tang Han.”</p><p>“Who is this Tang Han?” Asked Tang Xiu.</p><p>“She’s your First Uncle’s daughter,” answered Tang Guosheng.</p><p>Tang Xiu was taken aback and asked, “First Uncle has a daughter? How come I don’t know about her?”</p><p>Tang Guosheng forced a smile and said, “In order to have a station on Mist Source Island, we announced to the public that your First Uncle’s daughter died at the age of four, but she was in fact sent to Mist Source Island in secret. After having gone through various trainings since her childhood, she then successfully took over the Tang Manor Martial School by the time she turned eighteen. It’s been 11 years since. That child… she returned to Beijing every two years in secret. She is 29 years old now, but she has only returned 12 times. Our family… owes her way too much.”</p><p>The revelation aroused deep respect in Tang Xiu’s heart toward this cousin he had never meet. He nodded and said, “I understand, Grandpa.”</p><p>Tang Min took two things from the bag she carried—a small green book with the words Peace and Safe. The other one was a black badge with only a blood drop engraving on it.</p><p>“Xiu’er, this green book is the proof of identity of the State Security Department that was done for you, while this badge is the sign of our Tang Family’s secret force. Take this to your sister and she will naturally believe you,” said Tang Min in a low voice.</p><p>Tang Xiu nodded in response. After hesitating for a moment, he asked, “Grandpa, there’s someone else who wants me to go to Mist Source Island other than you, right? Who is he?”</p><p>Tang Guosheng and Tang Min exchanged looks, as the former immediately let out a bitter smile and said, “Really. I can’t hide anything from you. He’s the one at the top.”</p><p>“Which one?”</p><p>“The highest one.”</p><p>Tang Xiu squinted his eyes and asked, “Is there any benefits?”</p><p>“Just a sentence: Let bygones be bygones, forever loyal to the country,” said Tang Guosheng.</p><p>Tang Xiu was taken aback. He subconsciously took a cigarette and lit it. After taking a few deep puffs, he grinned and said, “This Senior chose to compromise and gave me the plenary country power to act! If my guess is correct, this small green book won’t be taken back either, right?”</p><p>“Indeed.” Tang Guosheng knew that his grandson was smart and immediately nodded and smiled.</p><p>“Alright,” Tang Xiu stood up. “That being the case, then I’ll take the job. When do I leave?”</p><p>“ASAP,” said Tang Guosheng. “The garrison base in Shanghai has prepared a military chopper. You can take off at any time.”</p><p>Tang Xiu then looked at Kang Xia and said, “I won’t be able to accompany you in today’s matter. Also, never disclose my whereabouts to anyone.”</p><p>There was deep worry and concern on Kang Xia’s face when she got up. Yet, she still nodded and exhorted, “Please do pay attention to your safety.”</p><p>“I know,” replied Tang Xiu.</p><p>Tang Guosheng and Tang Min did not rush to leave. They looked at Tang Xiu’s back as he quickly left the house, sighing at the same time.</p><p>****</p><p>Shanghai Garrison Base.</p><p>Hu Zhenfeng, who was clad in his army uniform, had been waiting for a long time. He was the Chief of Staff of the Mist Source Island Garrison with a senior colonel rank. Prior to this, he was just on leave and returned to Beijing on vacation, but the major incident that happened on Mist Source Island made him receive an order to escort Tang Guosheng to Shanghai and to stand by at the Shanghai Garrison Base.</p><p>To stand by and wait for someone.</p><p>He did not know who he was waiting for, and neither could he figure out what kind of identity this person had, to even make him, who was a Chief of Staff with a Senior Colonel rank, to wait.</p><p>Honk! Honk!</p><p>Four black SUVs came from a distance and parked near the apron of military helicopters, as a big man in a black suit opened the car’s door. Hu Zhenfeng’s eyes then fell on the rear door of the third car. He knew that someone who could enter straight from the outside was definitely a top brass.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
