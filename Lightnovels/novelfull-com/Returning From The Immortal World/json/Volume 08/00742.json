He also has a medicinal herbs business. Nearly all who engage in this business all year round know him. Just go there and you’ll find him.”</p><p>“Alright.” Xue Yu replied and then grabbed Tang Xiu’s hand, leaving the shop. She did not have a good impression of this shop owner at all. Such a short-sighted person who not only failed in his promise but also sold such a treasure cheaply was the type of person she really was disgusted with.</p><p>Tang Xiu himself never heard of the Singular Recherché Fruit, and neither did he know what was good about it. Though Xue Yu explained the healing effects of this fruit, he only saw it as a relatively precious spiritual fruit.</p><p>“Don’t worry. You still have the chance to buy it back since you know who bought it. At the worst, you will have to buy it at a much higher price.” Tang Xiu consoled her.</p><p>“I have to buy this Singular Recherché Fruit even if there’s only one chance,” said Xue Yu with a firm look. “I’ll make you the most lavish medicated diet after buying it.”</p><p>Medicated diet?</p><p>Tang Xiu’s mouth could not help but twitch. Spending millions to buy a precious spirit fruit turned out just to make a medicated diet for me? Xue Yu… she really doesn’t see paper money as money.</p><p>However, seeing such an uncommonly seen occasion made Tang Xiu disinclined to argue with her. After all, she spent a lot of money to buy it for his own sake.</p><p>Treasure Collection Store. It was a mosaic signboard hanging on the very ordinary door of the shop. The shopfront of the entire medicinal herbs store was very large but felt particularly empty inside. Other than a young clerk and a man and a woman who were playing with their mobiles, there was no one else.</p><p>As the young man saw Tang Xiu and Xue Yu, his eyes only stayed on Tang Xiu for a moment before moving to Xue Yu, unable to remove his eyes even for a moment.</p><p>Xue Yu was accustomed to seeing men acting strangely when they stared at her ever since she stopped wearing a veil. She ignored him and asked with a cold and clear voice, “We’re looking for Boss Huo.”</p><p>The young man seemed to have woken up from a dream. His delicate face instantly blushed. He had seen beautiful women, but not anyone as beautiful as Xue Yu. After all, he was very young and did not have enough self-control yet.  He thought that his stare a moment ago was quite rude, and stutteringly said with an awkward expression, “Gramps Huo… my Boss… he… he is receiving guests upstairs.”</p><p>Xue Yu gently nodded and said, “Can you take us upstairs? We have a business deal with your boss.”</p><p>“A-alright… fine… You… please follow me.”</p><p>In order to conceal his discomfiture and embarrassment, the young man answered stutteringly and then turned around, slightly running up the stairs. When he stepped on the second stair, he suddenly realized that his pace was a bit faster and the guests seemed unable to keep up. He then abruptly stopped for several seconds. After secretly glancing to the side, only then did he continue walking upstairs at a slower pace.</p><p>Tang Xiu only smiled. He knew well how the young clerk felt. If he did not experience the 10,000 years of life and cultivation in the Immortal World, he would be highly likely to act like this young clerk.</p><p>On the second floor.</p><p>Huo Siming’s office was located at the innermost of the shop. The office was usually used to receive important guests, and never once accepted any ordinary person. It was extravagantly and elegantly decorated with neat and lavish wooden furniture. The owner, Huo Siming, was now sitting before a mahogany tea table, stroking his white beard and constantly scanning the guests sitting on the opposite chairs appraising the medicinal ingredients on the table.</p><p>“Two guests, this Hoarfrost Fruit is definitely a good thing. I’ve been in this medicinal herbs market for many years, but only twice have I obtained this fruit. And this one is my second time. Moreover, the 6.5 million yuan I quoted to you is definitely a fair price.”</p><p>The two guests were a spirited old man in a Chinese tunic and an aging woman that still looked attractive and someone who attended the underground fighting competition would definitely know. She was the host of the underground fighting match finals… Black Widow.</p><p>The old man in Chinese tunic observed the spiritual fruit in his hand, but he was actually disdainful inwardly. Huo Siming mistakenly took this Singular Recherché Fruit as Hoarfrost Fruit, but he was very clear that this one was the former.</p><p>However, the reason he came to Shanghai’s medicinal herbs market this time was to find a Millennium Wild Ginseng and was unexpectedly found this precious fruit. Most importantly, it seemed that he could make a big bargain and did not feel like telling Huo Siming its true value.</p><p>Knock, knock…</p><p>The office’s door was knocked, as the young clerk then carefully pushed the door a slit open and looked around through it. As his eyes landed on Huo Siming, he immediately opened the door and said, “Boss, there are two honored guests here to see you. They said they want to make a deal with you.”</p><p>Huo Siming did not expect that his sales clerk actually barged in even though he knew what rules were. But after hearing his report, he suppressed his anger inwardly and said with a doubtful expression, “Honored guests who want to have a business deal with me? Who are they?”</p><p>Tang Xiu and Xue Yu then appeared at the door. As they entered the room, Xue Yu’s gaze instantly fell on the Singular Recherché Fruit held by the old man in Chinese tunic. A light flashed in her eyes as she said, “Are you Boss Huo? My name is Xue Yu and I want to buy that fruit from you.”</p><p>Huo Siming stared dully as a series of question tags popped up inside his head. He happened to come across this Hoarfrost Fruit yesterday by chance. Little did he think that he would encounter two waves of customers who were interested in this fruit. But then again, this was a great occasion nonetheless!</p><p>He could not help but feel a bit excited inside. The market should have competitions, to begin with. If these two really wanted to have this Hoarfrost Fruit, they would definitely compete in offering the price, and the last winner who would benefit from it was himself.</p><p>The old man in Chinese tunic turned his head to look at Tang Xiu and Xue Yu and then said before Huo Siming answered the question, “Young woman, I already booked this Hoarfrost Fruit, so your coming is rather unfortunate. Look elsewhere if you need it.”</p><p>Huo Siming’s face slightly changed and he quickly interjected, “You said you didn’t want to buy it just now, Mr. Situ, hence they still have the right to buy this Hoarfrost Fruit. You see, they have already stated their intention, so…”</p><p>The old man in Chinese tunic slightly frowned and a cold light flashed in his eyes. Old and experienced as he was, how could he not tell that Huo Siming wanted him to compete with these two young people who had just arrived? Although he did not like Huo Siming’s attitude and means, he had to admit that he did say that he would not buy it.</p><p>He somewhat regretted saying that, but now was not the time to brood over it. Let alone 6.5 million yuan, he would pay even 65 million.</p><p>But then again, he did not want to spend too much and be deceived on account of his generosity either. He got up slowly and looked straight at Tang Xiu and Xue Yue, saying, “The two of you, you should also take into account that the first to come will be the first to get the service, no matter what business you do. I already have this Hoarfrost Fruit in my hand, so I hope you leave it as it is.”</p><p>Black Widow did not know who Tang Xiu was. After all, there were too many spectators back then in the underground fighting competition, and she did not have the time to remember everyone. As the old man in the Chinese tunic got up, she also hurriedly followed suit and spoke, “Two guests, I introduce you senior Situ Hong from Beijing’s Situ Family. Even the patriarch of the Situ Family must address him as Second Uncle.”</p><p>Xue Yu knitted her brows. She could tell that this **** woman introduced Situ Hong and used the Situ Family to pressure them. Tang Xiu, who stood next to her, also had the same thought after hearing it.</p><p>“Situ Hong? You are determined to obtain it, aren’t you?” Asked Tang Xiu slowly.</p><p>“That’s right. I need this Hoarfrost Fruit.” Situ Hong nodded. “Boss Huo and I have already agreed on the price.”</p><p>“If so, less medicated diet for me, then!” Tang Xiu shook his head. “Besides, I do have a bit of friendship with the Situ Family, so I can’t refute your face this time.”</p><p>“Presumptuous!” Black Widow’s face changed and scolded angrily.</p><p>A bit of anger could be seen on Situ Hong’s face, while he also looked a bit stunned. He never thought that Tang Xiu wanted to buy this genuine Singular Recherché Fruit just for a medicated diet. It had to be noted that even if he did not identify this fruit as Singular Recherché Fruit and still bought it as a Hoarfrost Fruit, it would still cost him around 5 to 6 million yuan.</p><p>Huo Siming was a bit regretful inwardly. He thought that these two young people and Situ Hong would compete on the price, and he would be the last man who to benefit from it. He did not expect that the young man actually gave it up directly. He could only sigh inwardly as waved his hand and said, “Since you don’t want to buy it, then please go downstairs and wait for me there! I will entertain the two of you after entertaining these two guests.”</p><p>Xue Yu was somewhat unwilling. Upon hearing Huo Siming asking them to leave, she said with a hesitant look, “Tang Xiu, I really want to…”</p><p>“No, it’s fine missing one medicated diet!” Tang Xiu interrupted her. “Besides, it’s not worth it to haggle with this elder of the Situ Family over it.”</p><p>The reason he said that was that he was rather broke at present. Except for the 10 million yuan he gave to Xue Yu, there were only a little more than 2 million yuan left in his bank card. He would lose face if he were to compete against Situ Hong on the price.</p><p>“Let’s just go!” Tang Xiu grabbed Xue Yu’s shoulder and turned around.</p><p>“Please wait!”</p><p>Situ Hong had a slightly changed expression as he stepped forward and called.</p><p>“We already gave it up. What do you want now?” Tang Xiu turned around and asked with an annoyed expression.</p><p>There was a probing tone when Situ Hong answered, “This young woman just called you Tang Xiu, right? Could it be that you’re the young Divine Doctor of Star City Chinese Medical Hospital, Tang Xiu?”</p><p>“Little did I think that I’m so famous!” Tang Xiu said lightly. “To think that the Situ Family’s Second Uncle knows my name is rather unexpected!”</p><p>This time, Situ Hong’s complexion changed completely. There was a complicated expression in his eyes, as he then said, “It’s really you, Grandmaster Tang! I was really ignorant to not know your identity just now. Please forgive me if I have offended you. I do really want to buy this Hoarfrost Fruit, but I’m willing to gift it to you as a token of apology.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
