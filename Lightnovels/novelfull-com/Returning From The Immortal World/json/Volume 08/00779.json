The boundless and majestic momentum; the accumulation of killing intent contained within the flashing swords and saber-rattling, accompanied by bloody foul winds and rains of blood. Even the Everlasting Feast Hall’s experts could not help but have a change in expression.</p><p>“What a show of power!”</p><p>Zhenlei Duomo looked at the scene of the Intelligence War Elder Wu Ji, Keith Moore, and the others who preying each other mid-air in disbelief. She felt shocked like a tidal wave hitting her heart. She thought she was already strong enough but never occurred to her that the gap between her and these powerhouses from the Stygian Club and Pyramid was like a chasm.</p><p>Suddenly, her gaze moved from the battle between the two parties and fell on Tang Xiu’s indifferent expression. After hesitating for a bit, she asked, “I know that you’re much stronger than me, Mr. Tang. But how would you compare to these people… who is stronger?”</p><p>“I may not be their opponent if I fought them in a friendly match. But their chance of surviving against me is less than 1% if we really have to fight with our lives on the line,” said Tang Xiu indifferently.</p><p>The answer made Zhenlei tremble inside. She did not think that Tang Xiu was boasting, because in the face of such a bloody and frenzied battle that they possibly had to act and fight at any time, hence bragging would only court his own death.</p><p>Tang Xiu glanced at her before shifting back his eyes to the battle. The crazy battle in front drove away any ordinary human beings in the surroundings. Many people were not aware of that vampires and Elementalists exist in the world and therefore did not have the slight thought to pull the trigger of their guns in the face of these horrifying monsters from legends.</p><p>“Huh?”</p><p>While watching, Tang Xiu’s face suddenly changed.</p><p>The battle mid-air was originally a few kilometers away. And even though the Intelligence War Elder Wu Ji and Bodart also suffered minor injuries, their strength was still very powerful, while Keith Moore and his several underlings were in a different situation as his other men were all killed other than Basil and Alody.</p><p>What made Tang Xiu’s expression change was that these three vampires—Keith Moore, Basil, and Alody fought desperately but were still forced to retreat back by Wu Jie and Bodart, and were now heading toward his direction. With his farsightedness, Tang Xiu could clearly predict where these three would land on the ground. Once Wu Jie and Bodart caught up with them and fought in the vicinity around them, the Concealment Array would be affected and they would be exposed.</p><p>“Awu, give me a mask!” said Tang Xiu in a deep voice.</p><p>Mo Awu quickly took out two bronze masks from his interspatial ring and handed one to Tang Xiu, as he also put on the other one. Jin Shi and the others also grabbed their bronze masks in succession and quickly put them on. Only Zhenlei Duomo looked at them with a puzzled expression, wanting to speak but hesitating.</p><p>“Give her one!” said Tang Xiu.</p><p>“Got it,” Mu Awu glared at her first, but finally took one out and gave it to her.</p><p>“Tempest!”</p><p>Bodart, who was wearing a long blue robe and holding a red crystal rod, frenziedly waved the crystal rod and kept sending wind blades while pursuing them. The whole world in front of him was then inundated by hundreds of wind blades that fiercely hacked toward the remaining shadows of Keith Moore’s group of three.</p><p>As the trees on the mountainside were devastated by the wind blades and at the moment a towering big tree loudly fell to the ground, Keith Moor, Basil, and Alody had already landed on a spot less than a hundred meters away from the concealment array where Tang Xiu and the others were hiding.</p><p>“Target those two vampires who escaped previously.”</p><p>Tang Xiu instantly released his longsword right when the other party was getting closer. His figure instantly disappeared and appeared in front of Keith Moore. His violent sword was like tearing apart the space barrier as all the energies from all directions swarmed, as a dreadful killing strike was then launched.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>Keith Moore’s expression greatly changed, for he never expected that there would be an ambush in front. What scared him the most was that the ambusher was just popped out of thin are, and there were no signs and traces of his presence before.</p><p><em>Whoosh…</em></p><p>As a sword light swept away, Keith Moore’s wings were instantly cut off. A miserable shrieking scream sounded from him, but two sword lights came following out of the blue, piercing his abdomen and waist, and then struck into Basil and Alody’s chests. The two vampires, who had been injured, were caught off guard and hurriedly avoided the strike hitting their hearts, leaving two horrible bleeding wounds on their chests.</p><p>At this moment, right as Basil and Alody felt they just avoided a disaster and mustered all their strength to get away and escape from this place, eight flying swords came shooting at them.</p><p><em>Pu! Pu! …</em></p><p>The eight flying swords impaled their bodies, causing their blood to burst out.</p><p>In desperation, Basil and Alody fell down and crashed on the ground, causing thorough destruction of their Core Nucleus and completely dying.</p><p>Tang Xiu ignored Basil and Alody. He appeared right beside Keith Moore and conjured an art that created a horrible sight of tempestuous lightning that enveloped Keith Moore in an instant, while the long sword that hovered around Tang Xiu flashed and pierced Keith Moore’s head.</p><p><em>Bam…</em></p><p>At the moment when Keith Moore was hit hard, Tang Xiu sent a heavy punch to his chest. The powerful force did not shatter his Core Nucleus but still sent him flying upside down.</p><p>“Cut…”</p><p>The longsword hacked away from Keith Moore’s left shoulder through his heart and even cleaved his right in half.</p><p>Everything happened in just four-plus seconds.</p><p>Tang Xiu and the others appeared from the Concealment Array and only took four-plus seconds to finish the assassination, and the very formidable Keith Moore, who had a very high status in the Stygian Club, was killed along with his two men, Basil and Alody.</p><p>“Who are you?”</p><p>Wu Jie came down from midair with blazing flames hovering around him. After opening his arms to prevent the Pyramid’s experts who came behind him to continue forward, he stared fixedly at Tang Xiu and his men.</p><p>Tang Xiu sneered at him. After Mo Awu and the rest converged with him, he coldly stared back at Wu Jie and said, “You’re the one causing trouble in the territory of China, my country. And yet, you still ask who we are? You, who is hailed as the Intelligence War Elder of the Pyramid, turned out to be this idiot!”</p><p>China? Daoist cultivators?</p><p>Wu Jie’s body trembled and he instantly raided the golden scepter in his hand, saying, “You just killed the Stygian Club’s people and they have nothing to do with us, the Pyramid. An adage says that the enemy of my enemy is my friend. How about joining forces to eradicate all the Stygian Club’s experts on Mist Source Island, and then become friends?”</p><p>“Maybe we can be friends if you drag your Pyramid’s people back and leave Mist Source Island,” Tang Xiu sneered. “But if you keep coveting the resources of my Mist Source Island and invading our territory, then you’ll be our enemies!”</p><p>Wu Jie frowned, “Your meaning is… you represent the Chinese authority?”</p><p>“We are people under the Chinese authority and naturally can represent the official stance of the Chinese government,” said Tang Xiu coldly. “This Mist Source Island is in China sovereignty and is not open to outsiders. You have come here intruding our territory, thus I give you a chance to leave. Keep staying here, then your fate will not be better than these Stygian Club’s people.</p><p>Intense killing intent burst out from Bodart’s eyes. When Wu Jie had yet to reply, he had already stormed over toward Tang Xiu.</p><p>“YOU COURT DEATH!”</p><p>Mo Awu and the others rushed out, unleashing their flying swords to fight against Bodart.</p><p>Tang Xiu threw out 24 array disks. His hands conjured a rune in the air and the Coruscating Stars Array was laid out in just a few breaths and instantly activated. Wu Jie’s complexion drastically changed and flew backward for a hundred of meters in a flurry, and was luckily able to escape right at the moment the array was activated. But Bodart appeared directly inside the Coruscating Stars Array.</p><p>“Retreat! I’ll kill him!” Tang Xiu’s figure shifted and appeared in the array’s core as he then loudly shouted.</p><p>In a flash, Mo Awu and the others clearly heard the voice transmission from Tang Xiu commanding them to leave the Coruscating Stars Array. As they left the array, Tang Xiu controlled the big array and unleashed the four Divine Beasts, Azure Dragon, White Tiger, Red Phoenix, and Black Tortoise to appear out of the blue and encircle Bodart from four directions.</p><p>“Kill him.”</p><p>With Tang Xiu’s command, the four Divine Beasts unleashed their magical powers and launched unceasing fierce attacks on Bodart. The man himself had a very formidable strength and was a level stronger than Tang Xiu in his peak state. However, Tang Xiu had laid the Coruscating Stars Array according to the 24 principles of the constellation chart and, added with his deep knowledge in arrays, it made the Coruscating Stars Array become more powerful.</p><p>Only the Coruscating Stars Array itself had brought a huge crisis to Bodart, more so that it was under Tang Xiu’s control, making Bodart become surrounded by danger from all sides and almost be killed by the four Divine Beast several times.</p><p>From a spot over 100 meters away.</p><p>Wu Jie looked at the empty space with an expression of fright, for he was able to sense the mighty energy that was continuously being drawn from all directions and forming the special space. But he couldn’t see the scene inside since he stood outside.</p><p>There was no Tang Xiu nor Bodart to be seen there.</p><p>But Wu Jie perfectly realized that Tang Xiu must have used some method to trap Bodart inside, and it was more likely that Bodart was facing an enormous threat at this moment.</p><p>Wu Jie thought for a while and then suddenly called out, “How about chatting first, little boy?”</p><p>Inside the Coruscating Stars Array, Tang Xiu who heard that, had his face suddenly turn cold. In almost a flash, the Primal Chaos Force inside his body rushed out, causing the four Divine Beasts to nearly double in size in just a few breaths, the Coruscating Stars Array’s power multiplied.</p><p><em>Aaargh…</em></p><p>Bodart evaded the sweeping tail of the Azure Dragon, but his back was scratched by the White Tiger’s sharp claws, and badly bleeding. However, his crisis had not yet passed as the Red Phoenix sprayed out billowing flames to burn his body, while the Black Tortoise slammed his chest and broke his breastbone.</p><p>“DIE.”</p><p>Tang Xiu’s figure disappeared in the center of the array in a flash. His longsword turned into a streak of light that pierced through Bodart’s chest, while his figure appeared in front of him in order to prevent him from escaping. Then, his fist bombarded his forehead.</p><p>Blood splattered in all directions.</p><p>It was a one hit kill!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
