The four middle-aged men in the street corner were not the only onlookers who watched the slaughter scene, so were the others who hid and also watched the one-sided massacre in horror.</p><p>It was currently an era of peace and Mist Source Island rarely had a homicide case. Yet currently, an unimaginable massacre where dozens of people were being killed was occurring.</p><p>But suddenly, one of the two killers stood proudly in front of the Huimin Supermarket. His eyes glanced at the onlookers in the distance and he shouted in a heavy tone, “They deserve to die for committing crimes against public safety. The Mist Source Island is under the threat of the Darkening Virus, yet some people are deliberately creating chaos with their arsons, killings, and lootings. Such people must pay a grievous price. Neither the government nor the police has the ability to deal with the virus as they are too busy with other matters. In any case, we will become both the law enforcer and the judge on their behalf. Thus, we’ll punish those who commit crimes against public safety!”</p><p>Vigilantes replacing the government?</p><p>The frightened onlookers were instantly in astonishment.</p><p>They perfectly realized that public order was currently at its lowest point since members of the police force were infected by the virus and were unable to maintain the peace. The public law and order was something that directly affected the common people like themselves.</p><p>Suddenly, everyone’s hearts started calming down and those who were about to flee decided against it. Those who had the ability to fight were quietly approaching from every direction to look at two god-like… heroes.</p><p>Exactly. In their mind, they all called these two men heroes.</p><p>The tall and burly man who stood in front of the Huimin supermarket looked around. He could see that the spectators had a change in their expressions. He then continued speaking with a clear voice, “Divine Doctor Gui Jianchou has come from the mainland. He is putting his all into researching the antidote for the Darkening virus. We are hopeful that a good result will appear from his work by tomorrow or in a few days, so I hope everyone can pass this message along and that we can overcome this virus outbreak as soon as possible !”</p><p>Having said that, he beckoned to the four middle-aged men and loudly asked, “How are your bodies? Ask these friends around if you have any shallow injuries and help with disposing the dead bodies. Remember to move the bodies to the crematorium to prevent further breakout of the virus.”</p><p>“We’re all right.”</p><p>The four middle-aged men were all scarred and bruised—and even one them was in a serious condition—but they persevered enough to support themselves and walked step by step. It was needless to say, but they knew that the emergence of these two men had saved their lives; they were their savior.</p><p>“Alright. We’ll go first since we need to inspect other areas as well.”</p><p>The two burly men cupped their fists and quickly returned to the car, started it, and sped away.</p><p>Python City.</p><p>Wu Li dragged her tired body, carrying food she had just purchased from the supermarket. She crept along the path toward her house that was about a few hundred meters away. She was also infected by the Darkening virus and was in a very serious state. Even though the static electricity curbed the spreading of Darkening virus, it was still tormenting her day and night, sapping the strength from her body.</p><p>She was a single parent—a mother of a six-year-old daughter. Although she had a decently-paid job and was able to hire a nanny, the nanny had left, leaving only herself to take care of her daughter.</p><p>“Bahaha, we’ve got something hot here!”</p><p>Two drunkards dressed in suits and with neatly combed hair appeared. Their appearance looked like they should be executives of a company, if not owners of companies, yet their laugh, obscenity, and dirty thoughts revealed their true selves when they saw the pretty Wu Li.</p><p>“WHAT ARE YOU DOING?”</p><p>Wu Li’s expression quickly changed as the two men blocked her path. She had heard that the entirety of Python City had fallen into chaos recently, even hearing that there had been many murders.</p><p>One of the men touched his chin, grinning as he plunged toward Wu Li, grabbing her and forcing himself on her to kiss her.</p><p>Slap!</p><p>Although Wu Li didn’t have much strength left and she was unable to follow the man’s speed, it didn’t take much effort for her to slap the man. Unfortunately, she had no power to get rid of the man’s arm with her limited strength.</p><p>“YOU DARE SLAP ME, FUCKING BITCH!!”</p><p>The man released Wu Li and punched her in the face, sending her to slump on the ground, yet he continued to kick and punch.</p><p>“Old Zhou, don’t break her! We, brothers, still need to have this meat to vent up our urge today!” The other man stopped him and forcefully dragged Wu Li up.</p><p>Wu Li shouted for help, enduring the pain all over her body. There were many people who passed by her, at least a dozen of them within a radius of 200 meters; yet, nobody came to help her. All of them just minded their own businesses, showing their indifferent attitude.</p><p>Creak…</p><p>A car stopped and parked nearby. A burly man dashed out and directly stabbed the two men’s hearts.</p><p>“AAAAAH…”</p><p>The sudden turn of events shocked Wu Li and made her fearful. She staggered backward and slumped down on the cold concrete pavement.</p><p>The big man coldly shouted, “The law enforcers are unable to maintain the law and order, so I will be one to enact justice and punishment. Those who dare harm public safety, committing arsons, murders, and other fucking evil things will be killed with no mercy! Whoever dares to create panic, break the laws, and hinder us will be mercilessly suppressed—AND EXECUTED!”</p><p>“Divine Doctor Gui Jianchou is now devoting all of his efforts to study the antivirus for the infectious disease. You can expect his successful report in the next few days. Pass this message on to the others, and I hope you all can abide by the law until then. Wait for the antidote that will be delivered to your door!”</p><p>After saying that, the big man strode up to the flustered and panicked Wu Li. He extended his hand and pulled her up, saying, “Go home quickly! Wait for the antidote to be sent to your home so that you can resume your normal life.”</p><p>“Thank you. Thank you.”</p><p>A look of gratitude appeared on Wu Li’s face, followed by constant thanks coming from her mouth.</p><p>The burly man let out a simple smile, “This is what we should do to keep social stability and maintain the law and order. It’s the responsibility for each and every one of us!”</p><p>The big man quickly went back to his car and left.</p><p>Wolfpack City; Mixed Summit City…</p><p>Similar events also happened in both cities, where those who broke the law had been killed mercilessly and faced bloody repression. The news of these swift acts and the deeds of the “heroes” spread to the four major cities through word of mouth. This scared and deterred those who were committing crimes, causing none to dare act rashly for now.</p><p>In addition, the news spread that the Divine Doctor Gui Jianchou would soon see the results of his research into the antidote, and that antidote would be quickly proliferated and distributed to the millions of people in the four major cities. People seemed to see hope on the horizon, only wishing that the Divine Doctor’s research proceeded smoothly and he developed the antidote.</p><p>Mist Source Island.</p><p>In the center of the Southern side of the island was a village with a population of around 1000-2000 inhabitants. Here, Tang Xiu personally killed a large number of tyrannical people whose hands were stained by the blood of innocents. He then announced the news that Divine Doctor Gui Jianchou was currently researching the antidote for the Darkening virus and good results would soon come.</p><p>The inhabitants were instantly grateful to Tang Xiu and had hope. In the midst of their grateful remarks, the old village chief personally invited Tang Xiu and Tang Han to his house.</p><p>After the sumptuous dinner.</p><p>The old village chief accompanied Tang Xiu to drink his personally made wine. Tang Xiu was about to leave as soon as possible to inspect other places yet he still drank a lot.</p><p>Ring, ring, ring…</p><p>His communicator buzzed, dragging Tang Xiu back from his tipsiness. He took the mobile and saw that it was a call from Gu Xiaoxue. He immediately put the call through and asked, “You’ve arrived, Xiaoxue?”</p><p>“We just entered Mist Source Island, Grand Master.” Gu Xiaoxue’s sweet voice came out from the communicator. “Where are you now? We’ll immediately catch up with you.”</p><p>“Go straight to the big mountain in the center of the island,” said Tang Xiu. “I’m in the village on the southern side of the mountain, and do contact me again once you’re here…”</p><p>“Understood.”</p><p>After hanging up the phone, Tang Xiu immediately canceled his plan to go to the other areas. Since Gu Xiaoxue’s team had arrived, he must lead them to traverse the central area of the mountain. It must be noted that there were a lot of efficacious medicinal materials, spirit fruits, and precious ores inside that mountain.</p><p>All of these were the Everlasting Feast Hall’s scarcest resources for cultivation at the present.</p><p>The evening came and the stars hung in the night sky. Cool breezes were blowing gently creating a cooling sensation. Tang Xiu stood on a large bluestone in the outskirts of the village, looking up at the vast starry sky. It had been a year since he returned to Earth where he had experienced a lot of things. He should be very satisfied, for he had family members, friends, a career, and women. He had even found the one he cared for the most, Gu Yan’er.</p><p>However, at this moment, he felt somewhat at a loss. He missed the days when he lived in the Immortal World. Fond memories made him miss some of his best friends, and also… those few, precious “good friends”—those of whom he wanted to stand before and hack them with his sword.</p><p>“I’ll be benevolent to those who are good to me, and I’ll be evil to those who do evil deeds to me!”</p><p>“When I, Tang Xiu, set my feet on the fertile land of the Immortal World once again, I will unfold the foul wind and rain of blood. Those who are against me will perish and those who follow me will prosper. No one has ever succeeded to rule and reign in the Immortal World for eons. But as for me, I will dominate it. I will stand as the hegemon above myriads of races, for I will break and push the threshold of the gate of the Immortal World!”</p><p>Tang Xiu clenched his fists as his aura blasted out of his body, punching his fist into the void. Layers of qi created turbulence in the air, creating ripples that spread distantly in all directions.</p><p>Kilometers away from him.</p><p>A dozen cars quickly approached with Gu Xiaoxue sitting inside the front car. She could clearly see Tang Xiu who stood tall on the tree.</p><p>His figure was seemingly thin yet he looked very stalwart at this moment. That handsome look and the charms that he exuded made her heart a complete mess. His surging, imposing aura brought infinite grandeur as if he was the sovereign of the world.</p><p>Badump, badump…</p><p>Gu Xiaoxue’s heart suddenly accelerated and remained at a racing pace. The sensation that engulfed her was something that she could not clearly explain nor understand.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
