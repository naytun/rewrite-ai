But she was still shocked by the miserable scenes after the battle as well as the killings she had done that she even had cold sweats in her sleep.</p><p>Once, before all of this happened, she used to be a saintess in the minds of countless people. She was even a target of worship by millions of people.</p><p>Her whole heart was pure and her nature was on the lawful good side. With virtue after the education like that of the light of God, she did not readily accept facing the kindness from Wang Rui. It was because she didn’t want to involve, and eventually harm, innocent people, even if Wang Rui himself was seemingly not someone average.</p><p>“My enemies possess power that is far from what you can imagine and I guesstimate that they are around this water too, so I can’t involve you in this. But I’m very thankful towards you for these medicines.”</p><p>Viviani turned around to leave after saying that.</p><p>Wang Rui moved to block her path quickly as he spoke with a rather firm and overbearing tone and with a deep voice, “I’d let you leave if you had no injuries. But the current you will definitely die if you came across your enemies. You did say that your enemies are very powerful, but we’re not soft and weak people either. Besides, I’d love to have some fun during this very dull time. Of course, we can leave this place immediately if you’re still concerned with the situation and I’ll take you to Jingmen Island to avoid them.”</p><p>His words made Viviani excited as it was a hope of hers to come to Jingmen Island to take shelter there, since someone was there that may be able to help her.</p><p>“Shall we head to Jingmen Island now?” after mulling it over quickly, she asked with a bit of expectation.</p><p>“No problem.” Wang Rui nodded and said, “We can go now.”</p><p>Wang Rui’s men then released the roped grappling hooks and released the fishing boat in the open sea. The two liners then braved through the rough wind and waves and sailed toward Jingmen Island. The two liners didn’t have much damage despite the growing sea storm.</p><p>Wang Rui placed a glass of red wine in front of Viviani and went to the soft couch, sitting back while letting the alluring girls flock around him again. Wang Rui was no longer in high spirits from these flowers, however, as the women around him were in no way a comparison to Viviani whatsoever. Regardless of their looks or demeanors, the difference was like the difference between the clouds and mud.</p><p>“This is a red wine from Bordeaux, France—a premium red wine chateau made and preserved for 22 years. No matter its color or taste, it’s definitely top-notch. Have a taste of it, please. This red wine has a good effect in beautifying women’s appearances if they drink it,” said Wang Rui with a smile.</p><p>“Thank you.”</p><p>Yet, Viviani didn’t touch the red wine cup, nor did she taste the fruits and desserts on the table. She was still a bit wary in her encounter with Wang Rui at sea. The weather was, after all, kind of atrocious recently, yet Wang Rui actually came here seeking pleasure. It just was not right and was unusual.</p><p>On the liner’s bow.</p><p>A burly man stood straight up with his eyes seriously watching the surrounding waters. The sky was getting brighter and the day was gradually replacing the night, yet he was slightly restless inside since the storm was not weakening but was getting even heavier instead. The flashing lightning and thunder rumbling all indicated that the storm was getting stronger.</p><p>“Huh?”</p><p>Suddenly, his countenance slightly changed as his solemn eyes focused in one direction and he fixated on the black dot at sea in the distance. He immediately picked up a telescope and looked toward that side.</p><p>“Cargo ship?”</p><p>The staunch man recalled the dialog between Wang Rui and Viviani before and his alertness increased. He waved over towards a middle-aged man, told the man some words, and then the latter rushed into the cabin. The man and two other guards had yet to return to the other liner ever since Viviani boarded the ship. They were not at ease in the slightest even though Wang Rui himself was very strong.</p><p>“We might have some troubles ahead, Boss.”</p><p>“What troubles?” with brows raised, Wang Rui asked and continued, “Is it because the storm is getting stronger, or are Miss Viviani’s enemies catching up with us?”</p><p>“A medium-sized cargo ship appeared several miles away from us,” said the burly man. “I used a telescope to view it; the cargo ship has some people with guns, or I should say they are heavily armed, since they even have some heavy machine guns. They should have found us at the time I spotted them. Also, it seems like the cargo ship is heading toward our location judging by their direction.”</p><p>Wang Rui turned to see Viviani and asked, “Can you tell us about the background of your enemy? Please don’t misunderstand me. It’s not that want to pry into your private issues, but if these people are really your enemy, we might be unable to hide. The Chinese have a saying that, in battle, we must know our enemy and only then can we be victorious. I want to know the kind of people we might be facing so that it will be easier for us to deal with them.”</p><p>Viviani straightly stood up from the couch. The ruddy nuances on her stunning face were replaced by a despairing look, and she bitterly said, “They are the Savage Mammoth, a force of the underworld.”</p><p>Wang Rui turned around to see the big man and found the man’s face drastically changed. He pressed his brows and immediately asked, “You know the people Miss Viviani just mentioned, don’t you?”</p><p>“This Savage Mammoth is a powerful entity. They are a very strong organization in Europe with a notorious reputation.” The burly man nodded and bitterly said, “I dealt with the people from Savage Mammoth once. They are lunatics and harsh on themselves, more so than being savage to their enemies. Strictly speaking, it can be said that they are not human.”</p><p>“Elaborate with more specifics,” said Wang Rui.</p><p>“Savage Mammoth was originally a small force in the past, with arm and drug dealing as their main businesses,” explained the burly man. “A few decades ago, however, that organization secretly developed some drugs that were said able to infuse beasts’ blood into the human body. It was said to lead to the mutation of the human body. The drugs themselves were said to be very dangerous with only two out of ten who took it survived. But those who survived had some kind of abilities from the beasts…”</p><p>“I once encountered two people from Savage Mammoth who had been injected with some ant’s genes. There’s only one word to describe them: terrifying. Being able to lift a few hundred kilograms is already terrifying for normal people, but those two guys were able to lift a car weighing 2-3 tons!”</p><p>“And thus, Savage Mammoth continues to expand very quickly for about a decade or so now. They keep absorbing fresh blood and have become an enormous force. Outsiders are only aware of three major forces in the world: Pyramid, the League of Archcrusaders, and the Stygian Club. Only a few people know about the existence of Savage Mammoth. Of course, Savage Mammoth is indeed weaker than those three major forces, but no forces at the same size dare to provoke them either.”</p><p>The meaning in his last few words made it very obvious that he wished Wang Rui keep his hands out of this problem. He knew perfectly well that this Savage Mammoth was an entity Wang Rui couldn’t afford to touch.</p><p>Wang Rui himself frowned, feeling prickly and restless inside.</p><p>And yet, he had given his guarantee in front of Viviani that he had the ability to shelter her; he even boasted that he was able to cope with the people who had been hunting her. He would greatly lose face if he took back his words.</p><p>After mulling it over for a while, Wang Rui suddenly said, “Savage Mammoth is a very formidable organization, but it’s based in Europe, right? This is water belongs to China. It’s not like the Savage Mammoth’s people dare to wantonly kill people here, right? Hmph… it shouldn’t be a problem as long as we are not facing their entire organization for the time being. Tell everyone else, and immediately issue a warning if the enemy is approaching. If they ignore it, get ready for battle!”</p><p>The hesitation that Wang Rui had a moment ago was keenly detected by Viviani. The fellow seemed to have made up his mind, but Viviani still had some concerns. After a few seconds of silence, she said, “You have a speedboat on your liner, right?”</p><p>“Yeah? Why mention it?” Wang Rui nodded.</p><p>“Give me the speedboat and I’ll leave alone,” said Viviani. “Mr. Wang, Savage Mammoth has sent its experts. A lot of them this time. I spent a lot of effort to shake them off but I was unable to, so I can’t involve and implicate you on this one.”</p><p>Wang Rui raised his hand and was about to speak, but suddenly angry roars came from outside the cabin causing him to swallow back his words.</p><p>“YOU’LL FUCKING DIE, ASSHOLES!”</p><p>On the ship’s bow, two foreign youths drenched with rainwater surrounded one of Wang Rui’s men with a dagger in their hands. Another of Wang Rui’s men had his throat slit and was convulsing on the floor.</p><p>The burly man leaped out of the cabin lightning fast. The moment he appeared on the bow, he instantly pulled out a Mitsubishi army knife on his waist and aggressively plunged forward toward the foreign youths drenched in water. His movement was very fast; coupled with his formidable strength, he was at least at the martial arts grandmaster level. In just two breaths, the Mitsubishi army knife in his hand had stabbed the back of one of those foreign youths.</p><p>“Retratto!”</p><p>An order to withdraw in Italian was heard from the injured youth. The two men jumped towards the sea without hesitation.</p><p>The big man and another middle-aged man stood at the ship’s side and watched the two foreign youths in the water with obvious murderous intent. As Wang Rui caught up with them, he immediately checked one of his men who was lying on the floor. He found the man’s convulsion weak and saw him gradually lose his breath.</p><p>“Savage Mammoth… Fuck!”</p><p>Wang Rui stood and clenched his fists. He was sure now that Savage Mammoth’s people likely had no good intentions towards them, even without Viviani onboard. They didn’t even check whether she was with them on the ship, yet they shamelessly sent their men to ambush them.</p><p>Viviani quietly came behind Wang Rui and her eyes glanced at the dead man. She apologetically said, “I’m really sorry. I’ve involved your people.”</p><p>“No. They shouldn’t have known that you’re here with me yet they still ambushed us.” Wang Rui shook his head and said, “This Savage Mammoth is indeed very powerful. They silently came here through the seawater, even in the midst of this atrocious weather and large waves, to launch a sneak attack on my men. It seems like there’s a fierce battle ahead.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
