Come again?”</p><p>Su Lingyun zoned out for a moment and her eyes turned wide. As she saw Gu Xiaoxue lower her head and blush from ear to ear, she suddenly realized something, patted her hand and laughed. “Hehehe, great, great, great. Xiaoxue, it’s truly a blessing for Xiu’er to think that he can obtain your care.”</p><p>Having said that, she immediately took the red register book next to her and wrote Gu Yan’er’s name on the first page, and then Gu Xiaoxue’s on the second page.</p><p>“I…”</p><p>Gu Xiaoxue’s mouth opened, but she swallowed back what she wanted to say.</p><p>Putting down the register book, Su Lingyun then looked up at Gu Xiaoxue and said, “I understand your concerns, Xiaoxue. Xiu’er is your Grand Master according to seniority. However, I think those who cultivate on the path of immortality don’t need to stick to such a trivial thing anymore. Your Master can become Xiu’er’s woman, so why can’t you? I, too, have always thought that hierarchical seniority was important, but now I understand that as long as you sincerely love someone, what does it matter the gap in generations when it comes to someone you love? Just put down the concern in your heart, I’ll speak to Yan’er later.”</p><p>“En!” Gu Xiaoxue lowered her head while her face turned redder.</p><p>Su Lingyun grabbed her hand and smilingly said, “Xiaoxue, the reason I called you is that I need you to give me some recommendations to write some names in this register. You’re quite close to Xiu’er, so you should know some of them.”</p><p>Gu Xiaoxue hesitated before nodding gently. “I do know some of them.”</p><p>Su Lingyu’s eyes lit up. She immediately nodded and said, “Tell me. I’ll write their names here.”</p><p>“Kang Xia, Mu Wanying, and Ouyang Lulu. You should also know the relationship between these three with Grand Master,” Gu Xiaoxue said.</p><p>While registering the names, Su Lingyun said, “Don’t address Xiu’er as Grand Master anymore, Xiaoxue. Just call his name directly. I know these three girls and am very familiar with them too. Who else aside from them?”</p><p>“Xue Yu,” Gu Xiaoxue added.</p><p>Su Lingyun’s smile became a bit thicker as she wrote Xue Yu’s name on the sixth page. She then asked again, “Are there more?”</p><p>Gu Xiaoxue hesitated for a moment and then said, “Zhang Xinya and Zhang Xinyue.”</p><p>Su Lingyun wrote their names on the seventh and eighth pages. Then, she nodded and said, “I love those twin sisters. I do. Xinya used to be a big star and quite a famous goddess in the eyes of many people. I heard that Xinyue is also an outstanding woman. She found and runs her own business and earns herself a great life. Do you know anyone else?”</p><p>Gu Xiaoxue shook her head and said, “I have no idea about the others.”</p><p>Su Lingyun nodded contentedly and then said, “Eight candidates. Even though the number is a far cry compared to the Three Palaces and Six Chambers which housed 72 imperial concubines in ancient times, it’s already a lot for Xiu’er.”</p><p>Suddenly, the door was knocked and a small head poked out. When the female saw Su Lingyun and Gu Xiaoxue inside, a bright smile appeared on the delicate and lovely face and she pushed the door and walked inside. After quickly approaching Su Lingyu, she chuckled and said, “Auntie, I went to Europe a few days ago and bought a Chanel bag for you. Please take a look and see whether you like it.”</p><p>Went to Europe and bought a Chanel bag a few days ago?</p><p>Su Lingyun and Gu Xiaoxue exchanged glances, and both of them were at a loss whether they had to cry or laugh. Andy had been on Nine Dragon Islands for more than half a year. How come she went to Europe a few days ago? That was simply nonsense, though that Chanel bag was indeed beautiful.</p><p>Su Lingyun and Gu Xiaoxue held back their urges to chuckle and smile. They could see, Andy’s face that clearly portrayed her “ulterior motive”. Su Lingyun just received the handbag from her and happily nodded with a smile. “That’s very nice of you. This is a beautiful bag, and many others will definitely envy me when I go shopping later. Thanks, Andy.”</p><p>“Please, nevermind it. It’s just my filial piety towards you,” Andy hurriedly said.</p><p>Filial piety? Well, it does look like filial piety.</p><p>Thinking about it deeply with a happy mood, Su Lingyun then said, “Well, I’m currently discussing the list of candidates for Xiu’er’s harem, Andy. I’ve already written Kang Xia’s name. Do you have any other name I can list?”</p><p>Andy hurriedly squatted and held Su Lingyun’s name and replied smilingly, “Why don’t you write my name, Auntie? It’d be my pleasure to have my name listed.”</p><p>“Pfft… Hahaha…”</p><p>Su Lingyun couldn’t help laughing out loud, while Gu Xiaoxue was at a loss whether she had to cry or laugh, looking at Andy with admiration.</p><p>She’s really bold, daring to love and face regret alike!</p><p>In this regard, Gu Xiaoxue admitted that she was really far from being Andy’s match.</p><p>Su Lingyun grabbed the register with a smile and wrote Andy’s name on the ninth page. Then, she smilingly asked, “How about now? Are you now happy?”</p><p>“Uh, en, en, en. So glad and satisfied. Thanks, Mom.” A bright smile plastered Andy’s exquisite and lovely face as she nodded repeatedly.</p><p>Mom?</p><p>The happy smile on Su Lingyun’s face became more brilliant, while Gu Xiaoxue next to her secretly raised her thumbs up when Su Lingyun didn’t notice. Such a quick change of addressing… that was so goddamn fast!</p><p>After a while, Andy left the room happily and the door was knocked again when Gu Xiaoxue was about to leave.</p><p>Wearing her usual black robe but without her usual mask, Tang An walked inside with her supple black hair fluttering and brought a bowl of Eight Precious Lotus Seed soup. As she casually came to Su Lingyun’s front, she gently glanced at Gu Xiaoxue, smiled, and then spoke to Su Lingyun softly, “I haven’t seen you having dinner tonight, so I brought this Eight Precious Lotus Seed soup for you from the kitchen. Would you like to have it?”</p><p>Having said that, however, Tang An’s blushed a bit.</p><p>Su Lingyun cast a suspicious look and hesitated. “Who are you, Miss?”</p><p>“I’m Tang An,” Tang An replied softly.</p><p>Tang An?</p><p>Although Su Lingyun had seen Tang An many times, this was her first time seeing her true face. She never dreamed that Tang An was such a peerless, soul-stirring beauty.</p><p>However, the first thought that came to Su Lingyun’s mind was, pity. Such a beautiful girl, yet she had never dressed up properly and always wore a black robe and even put on a bronze mask on her face.</p><p>“Alright, I’ll drink it. I am especially fond of this Eight Precious Lotus Seed soup.”</p><p>It was just not long ago since Su Lingyu had a meal, but she didn’t reveal to Tang An and took the bowl of soup and drank half of it before she put it on the tea table. Afterward, she grabbed Tang An’s hand and pulled her to sit next to her. Her other hand took the register book and then asked in a soft voice, “There are nine names already written on this register. Would you like me to add your name to it?”</p><p>Tang An tilted up her head and secretly glanced at Gu Xiaoxue. The latter wore a playful and teasing look on her face and made her heart weaken. She immediately lowered her head and blushed from ear to ear and then slightly nodded.</p><p>Su Lingyun’s smile was especially brilliant, and she opened the tenth page to write Tang An’s name on it. Then, she smilingly said, “Call me Mother later, got it?”</p><p>“En!”</p><p>The redness on Tang An’s face turned redder just like a fiery glowing sun as she nodded gently. Suddenly, she looked up at Su Lingyun and said, “Mother… C-could you write another name?”</p><p>“Whose name?” Su Lingyun was puzzled.</p><p>“Gong Wan’er,” Tang An said.</p><p>Su Lingyun was surprised. “Do Gong Wan’er and Xiu’er have this kind of…”</p><p>“No. But the feelings can be developed slowly in the future.” Tang An shook her head and said, “However, Gong Wan’er’s constitution is very special and will be very beneficial to Grand Master’s cultivation.”</p><p>“Did she give her consent on this matter, though?” Su Lingyun hesitated.</p><p>“I’ve talked with her about this matter and she also likes Grand Master very much,” Tang An said. “She said that she has never seen a better man than Grand Master in her life.”</p><p>“If so, then I’ll put her on the list too,” Su Lingyun said. “But Little An, you’re not to address Xiu’er as Grand Master again later. Just call his name directly.”</p><p>“About this… a-alright.” Tang An gently nodded.</p><p>A few minutes later, after Tang An left, Gu Xiaoxue, who had long endured her hot, embarrassed feeling, saying, “Mother, would you like to rest or would you like me to stay with you to chat?”</p><p>“That’s exactly my intention, child.” Su Lingyun chuckled and said, “Well, Andy and Tang An have come. I wonder who is going to come next.”</p><p>Outside the palace.</p><p>Kuwako had obviously spent time dressing up intentionally. Her long gown fluttered and she put on various jewelry as she stood at the front door of the place. Being stared at by the two guards outside the door, she couldn’t help but feel a hot, burning feeling on her face, wishing that she could find a burrow to drill into and hide.</p><p>“Huh?”</p><p>Suddenly, her expression shifted and she looked at a beautiful woman whose beauty could ruin a country. The belle who just came out from the inside made her feel incredulous. The aura of this peerless beauty was quite erratic at this time and turned out to be… Tang An?</p><p>She…</p><p>Kuwako blocked Tang An’s path and asked, “Aren’t you Tang An?”</p><p>“Yeah!” Tang An gently nodded.</p><p>Kuwako’s eyes shifted to the interior behind the palace’s door and hesitated. Then, she asked, “You were inside… for…”</p><p>“Registration…”</p><p>Tang An replied lightly with one word. Her figure then flickered and she instantly vanished.</p><p>Register?</p><p>Kuwako seemed to become aware of something and no longer hesitated. She flew into the palace and then came to the second floor. Just as she was about to stop an envoy inside to inquire Su Lingyun’s whereabouts, she suddenly noticed Viviani standing on the corridor.</p><p>“You too…”</p><p>Kuwako came to Viviani and asked in surprise.</p><p>“Uh, I’m a bit scared.” Viviani forced a smile.</p><p>How could Kuwako not have any fear? Just a while ago, she kept holding on for a few minutes, standing outside the palace door and hesitating. If it wasn’t for Tang An, she wouldn’t have the courage to come inside. Looking at the bitter and forced smile on Viviani’s face, Kuwako suddenly felt certain about something and let out a smile. Afterward, she pulled her hand and said, “Actually, I’m also a bit scared just like you. But Tang An has been here, do you think we still need to feel scared?”</p><p>“But… what if… Sect… he’s not… interested in us. What should we do?” Viviani hesitated.</p><p>“I’ve long observed and inquired his stance on this matter. He never actively pursued any woman, whether they are Kang Xia, Ouyang Lulu, Mu Wanying, or Xue Yu. They were all the ones who seized the initiative to pursue him. If they can do it, why can’t we? Besides, I don’t think we lose out to them be it our looks, figures, bearings, and cultivation levels, to begin with.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
