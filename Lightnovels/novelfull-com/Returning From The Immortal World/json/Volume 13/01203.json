I thought you forgot about me already.” Li Longji excitedly exclaimed. “I’ve been wishing for a long time, hoping you’ll come back to render medical service at our Star City Medical Hospital again!”</p><p>“Let’s save the talk about the medical practice for later, President Li.” Tang Xiu said, “There’s something I need to ask you.”</p><p>The old man’s complexion stagnated and his tone immediately turned serious, “Speak.”</p><p>“Long Zhengyu is said to be injured and is now being treated in Star City Chinese Medical Hospital, isn’t he? What is his current condition? Is it serious?”</p><p>“Very.” Li Longji wryly smiled and went on. “I was the one who examined him. Three broken ribs and spleen severely injured, which caused a slight internal hemorrhage. His brain and nerves suffered from the external heavy blow and he hasn’t yet recovered from the coma until now. All in all, he hasn’t passed the dangerous period yet. But the most unfortunate thing is about his genital. Unless there are special means, I’m afraid he won’t be a complete man anymore in this life.”</p><p>“What?!” Tang Xiu exclaimed.</p><p><em>His genital is damaged and he won’t be a complete man anymore?</em></p><p>Disbelief overflowed in Tang Xiu’s eyes along with killing intent birthed in his heart. Long Zhengyu was among the first friends he made after returning to Earth. He wouldn’t have developed so fast in recent years if it wasn’t for him, and neither would he have the funds to purchase cultivation resources at the early period of development.</p><p>Afterward, they kept in contact continuously. Although he knew that Long Zhengyu treated him with sincerity and became his loyal friend due to his identity, he also regarded him as a good friend, regardless. And now, he had been severely injured by some foreign tycoon group invited by his Magnificent Tang Corp.</p><p>“I’ve learned about the situation, President Li. I estimate I’ll be arriving at the hospital in about half an hour. We’ll talk again later if you’re not in the hospital now,” said Tang Xiu after taking a deep breath.</p><p>“Just come over here. I’m still at the hospital!” said Li Longji quickly.</p><p>Half an hour later, when Tang Xiu appeared in the Star City Chinese Medical Hospital and stopped his car in the parking lot, he saw Li Longji approach him fast along with four middle-aged doctors in white coats.</p><p>“Tang Xiu!”</p><p>Li Longji paced forward and intimately held and shook Tang Xiu’s hands.</p><p>Tang Xiu nodded in response and said, “Can we head straight to Long Zhengyu, President Li? I want to have a look at his condition. I’ll do my best to treat him if the medicine I have can be used, else the disability will greatly affect his life forever. It might even ruin him.”</p><p>“He’s in the ICU at the moment. I’ll escort you there myself.” Li Longji nodded and said, “Also, let me introduce you to these men on the way there. The four of them are expert doctors in the hospital and separately have expertise in the brain, internal medicine, neurology, and urology fields. They are also the doctors in charge of Long Zhengyu’s treatment.”</p><p>Tang Xiu nodded to the four men and said, “I haven’t been to Star City Chinese Medical Hospital for a long time. It never came to me that the hospital has changed a lot—much better than before with more patients as well. Such a scale maybe has surpassed the First Public Hospital of Star City, hasn’t it?”</p><p>“It was you who granted the chance for it to happen!” Li Longji smilingly said, “The present Star City Chinese Medical Hospital would have stagnated in its previous state if it wasn’t for you.”</p><p>After a simple and brief introduction, Li Longji took Tang Xiu to the newly built inpatient building where the ICU room was located. Tang Xiu didn’t put on a sterile suit and just went directly inside. He looked Long Zhengyu, who now wore an oxygen mask with some catheters inserted into his body. Then, he reached out to take his wrist and check his pulse.</p><p>A few minutes after, he reached out to pull out all the catheters on Long Zhengyu’s body, including the oxygen mask. After this, he took out a Holy Healing pill from the interspatial ring and stuffed it into his mouth. At the same time, he also injected his Primal Chaos energy into his system. After helping him digest the Holy Healing pill, Tang Xiu looked at the five people in sterile clothes and said in a deep voice, “President Li, I’ll take over Long Zhengyu’s treatment and personally treat him. The Hospital only needs to arrange the best care well.”</p><p>“Are you confident you can cure him?” asked Li Longji hurriedly asked.</p><p>Tang Xiu pondered for a moment and shook his head, slowly saying, “I can treat his injuries, but I am helpless with his brain damage unless I can find a miraculous spiritual herb.”</p><p>“What herb is it?” asked Li Longji.</p><p>“An herb called Conscience Flower,” said Tang Xiu.</p><p>Li Longji was dumbfounded, whereas the other four furrowing their brows. They quickly exchanged glances and shook their heads to express that none of them had ever heard of this spiritual herb.</p><p>Tang Xiu forced a smile and said, “In actuality, I have no idea where to find this spiritual herb either, as it’s really too rare. It usually only grows in volcanic craters with frequent eruptions. Ah, let’s drop it first. I’ll think about some other solutions again and try my best to make him recover as before.”</p><p>“I believe you can do it given your superb medical expertise.” Li Longji nodded.</p><p>Tang Xiu no longer spoke and gave hints to the five people to leave first. Then, he began to regulate and rejuvenate Long Zhengyu’s bodily functions and used his Primal Chaos energy to nourish his damaged body.</p><p>After half an hour, he came out of the ICU room and saw more than 10 people waiting outside. Aside from Li Longji’s group of five, there were also the Long Family, as well as Kang Xia and Andy.</p><p>“Tang Xiu, Zhengyu… how… is he now?” Long Hanwen grabbed his hand with anticipation on his face.</p><p>“I’ve treated his flesh injuries, Uncle Long. The injuries won’t be a problem anymore.” Tang Xiu comforted him. “But I haven’t yet been able to figure out how to treat his nerves and brain damage. It’s possible that he will soon wake up without any sequelae, but there is also a chance he will be in a coma for a long time due to the damage to his brain and nerves. But please rest assured. I’ll find a way to wake him up as soon as possible.”</p><p>After hearing his explanation, Long Hanwen asked again cautiously, “If he wakes up, can he still marry and have children in the future?”</p><p>“That won’t be a problem.” Tang Xiu smiled and went on. “I’ll make sure he’ll be no different from a normal man.”</p><p>Long Hanwen’s tense and anxiousness finally dissipated a lot and a smile appeared on his square old face. He sighed. “Zhengyu having a friend like you is truly the greatest blessing in his life. I believe you’ll be able to wake him up given your outstanding medical expertise.”</p><p>“He’s my friend, giving my best to treat him is just natural.” Tang Xiu smiled and said, “Uncle Long, President Li will arrange the hospital’s experts and doctors to tend to Zhengyu’s treatment and check his condition at all times, there’s no need for you and the others to stay here. Please go back home first.”</p><p>Long Hanwen gave it a thought and nodded. “Alright, we’ll go back first. But do call me right away if something happens.”</p><p>“I’m staying.” Long Xueyao suddenly interjected. “Besides, there’s something I need to consult with Tang Xiu.”</p><p>Long Hanwen stared dully for a moment before a strange expression appeared on his face. He then shot a look at Tang Xiu and suddenly said with a smile, “Being occupied is great. Really great! Xueyao, keep Tang Xiu accompany well and do your best to satisfy his request, whatever it is.”</p><p>Everyone present was all people with smart heads and each of them let out a meaningful smile upon hearing Long Hanwen’s remark. However, when Andy squeezed out and quickly came to Tang Xiu’s side and grabbed his hand, the smile on the faces of Long Hanwen and everyone else instantly froze.</p><p>Tang Xiu could only force a wry smile inwardly. After sending off Long Hanwen’s group and letting Li Longji and the hospital’s team of doctors tend to their duties, he turned to Long Xueyao and asked, “What’s exactly the issue that made you look for me, though?”</p><p>“A friend of mine will have a wedding the day after tomorrow, can you go with me to her wedding ceremony?” asked Long Xueyao with hesitation.</p><p>“You want me to accompany you to your friend’s wedding?” Tang Xiu was confused. “Aren’t you looking at the wrong person? You should ask your boyfriend to go with you on such an occasion.”</p><p>“I don’t have a boyfriend.” Long Xueyao forced a wry smile. “Besides, it’s not what you think it is. This friend of mine is a bit… special. If you come with me, you might be able to cure her illness.”</p><p>“Why didn’t she visit the doctor and come to the hospital, though?” said Tang Xiu.</p><p>Long Xueyao glanced at Kang Xia and Andi, saying, “Her situation is very complicated and I just can’t explain it to you now. You just need to tell me whether you can accompany me or not. I promise that it won’t take your time for long, just a few hours.”</p><p>Tang Xiu pondered for a moment and said, “I can’t promise you on that for the time being since Long Zhengyu is severely injured. My Magnificent Tang Corp. is related to this incident and can’t escape from the responsibility, so I must completely deal and solve this problem. Alright, wait for my reply tomorrow night. I promise I’ll go with you if my schedule allows me to squeeze some time for the day after tomorrow. Is that OK with you?”</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Long Xueyao knew and understood Tang Xiu’s situation, so she nodded said, “Then I’ll be waiting for a reply tomorrow night. See you again later.”</p><p>Tang Xiu watched her back until she disappeared at the corner of the front corridor. Then, he retracted back his vision and asked with furrowed brows, “Kang Xia, what exactly is the situation pertaining to those foreign companies here?”</p><p>Kang Xia forced a smile and said, “The announcement we made that we’re searching distributors for our products immediately made tons of business people all over the world to flood over here. We only have a few products, but the number of companies that have come here is already over 200. 100 of which are large companies coming only for God’s Nectar. But most importantly, all of them are offering checks while stating that they would still aim to strike the deal to cooperate even if the Magnificent Tang Corp. put for more excessive demands.”</p><p>“It feels to me that we’re just some golden eggs laying hen in the eyes of those world-class major companies.” Tang Xiu sighed. “But it’s also evident that those people think that whoever can board the ship that is our company will have lots of banknotes flying into their pockets later. But in any case, kick out that foreign company of the list—the one that is responsible for Long Zhengyu’s injuries!”</p><p>“It has been excluded,” said Kang Xia.</p><p>Tang Xiu nodded in response and went on, “One other thing, sort out the portfolio of those companies and sent them to me later. We’ll continue this discussion after I read them.”</p><p>There was, however, something else he didn’t state, which was the fact that many world-class major companies were secretly under control by cultivators. It was a must to avoid any business dealings with those who were under his enemies, else it would have a huge impact on the business once they had some clashes in the future.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
