Only less than 2,000 members of Sacred Flame survived after the insane battle, most of whom were badly battered, and some had even become disabled.</p><p>The losses this time were greater than the last Ninth-grade Sacred Flame mission. Precisely speaking, it was much worse. Even if he obtained 20 billion dollars in the end, he would likely need to spend 15 billion to make up for the heavy losses and compensate the disabled experts of the organization.</p><p>Still, what vexed him the most was that no matter how much money he could eventually get into his own hands, he noticed that none of Tang Xiu’s men had died in battle. Although most of them had injuries, only a few were severe, whereas the rest were only slightly injured.</p><p>What did that mean? It was an obvious indication that the Tang Sect had more than enough power to obliterate the Celestial Wizard Clan thoroughly. Why did nobody from Tang Sect lend a hand and just sit by when his Sacred Flame fought the Celestial Wizard Clan on the fourth island? Why did Tang Sect insist on making the Sacred Flame join in the battle when they just arrived on the fifth island?</p><p>Vulcan even witnessed with his own eyes that the Tang Sect’s experts nearby didn’t lend a hand at all when members of his Sacred Flame were slaughtered by the Celestial Wizard Clan’s experts. Else, his Sacred Flame’s members wouldn’t have suffered such a huge loss.</p><p>This was utterly appalling and horribly miserable!</p><p>Never once had Vulcan hated someone so much as he hated Tang Xiu and Tang Sect today even though he had hated many people in this life.</p><p>He wanted to demand explanations from Tang Xiu, but the sudden change made him strike the surging aura several times, only to find himself blown away again and again. Tang Xiu didn’t give him a chance to speak in person.</p><p>“Speak up! You all must give me an explanation, or this shit won’t finish here!”</p><p>Overwhelmed by anger, Vulcan had no regard for anything anymore as he stood at the harbor by the edge of the array shield. Resentment and hatred filled his eyes.</p><p>The white-attired Tang Guang, whose clothes were stained with blood and radiating a bloody smell, and looked like he just crawled out of the sea of blood, came to him. He didn’t even bother to wipe off the blood of his handsome face.</p><p>However, he was now smiling and staring at Vulcan, and then said with a soft voice, “Do you really want an explanation, Mr. Vulcan? More so demanding it from my Sect Master and the entire Tang Sect?”</p><p>“I don’t give a fuck whoever it is! Either your Sect Master or Tang Sect must give me an explanation!” Vulcan furiously yelled, “We are your ally, we agreed to fight side-by-side. But the experts from your sect never lent a hand and just turned a blind eye to my Sacred Flame’s people. That makes me feel like shit. Why did you rescue your own kin and the Dark Shaman clansmen but neglected my Sacred Flame brothers?”</p><p>Tang Guang lowered his head, but his smile became brighter as he softly replied, “Mr. Vulcan, since you demand an explanation, then I’ll give you one on behalf of my Grand Master here and now…”</p><p>The moment his voice faded away, an immortal sword flashed from his left hand in an instant and shot Vulcan’s forehead.</p><p>Caught off guard, Vulcan desperately avoided the strike and barely evaded the lightning bolt-like sword strike. However, just as he felt at ease for a moment, he instantly noticed a faint fluctuation in the air…</p><p>Puff…</p><p>The immortal sword that appeared out of thin instantly pierced Vulcan’s heart and the sword tip went through his chest. Immediately after, Vulcan felt like True Essence energy exploded in his chest like a volcano eruption. The surging blast of the True Essence energy even blew a hole on his chest.</p><p>His heart was completely destroyed, along with all five internal organs. The violent True Essence energy even severed all his meridians when he tried to circulate his power.</p><p>BOOM…</p><p>Mo Awu’s violent punch then hit him. As the immortal sword blasted out of Vulcan’s body, his figure was sent flying like a snapped kite towards the back.</p><p>“W-w…. why?”</p><p>His remaining consciousness was filled with confusion as he asked the question with all the remaining strength he had left with difficulty.</p><p>Tang Guang immediately appeared in front of Vulcan with a chilling and grim expression. As his immortal sword beheaded the man’s head, he laughed loudly and shouted, “You ask me why? Because your Sacred Flame is no longer necessary! Your Sacred Flame is nothing but some fucked and wicked organization. You only see money and disregard anything else, whether what you do is right or wrong! You never bothered whether those who you killed were innocent people. It’s also your Sacred Flame shits who abducted and severely wounded a Tang Sect member before you gave him to the Supreme Elder of Celestial Wizard Clan!”</p><p>Mo Awu also flickered and instantly appeared next to Vulcan’s body and sneered. “Hmph, even our Sovereign declares that your Sacred Flame is nothing but a bunch of assholes who only see money without giving any regards to people. The only reason we spent the money to hire you is to make you all as cannon fodders, to being with. Don’t tell me you have no idea about being cannon fodder? Only when you got such heavy blows and meet your demise here can you make things right for what you’ve done! But you, as the chief of these shits, is the one who is the most responsible for the all pitiful people killed by your Sacred Flame Organization.”</p><p>The world was frantically revolving in Vulcan’s sight and he finally saw his headless body, the blood column that wildly sprayed out around his neck, and the hole on his chest. His consciousness quickly dissipated, but despair and intense regret filled his whole being before his consciousness vanished.</p><p>That’s right, regret. He regretted asking a tiger for its skin and dropping his vigilance towards the Tang Sect.</p><p>No matter how rich he was, even if a mountain gold and silver were presented before his eyes, what use was all that wealth if he ended up like this?</p><p>He wanted to growl and curse, yet he found that he couldn’t utter any sound. The moment his mouth was opened, the faster his consciousness faded away. His whole world turned dark as the last scene disappeared before his eyes and his consciousness finally dispersed completely.</p><p>With contempt and disdain on his face, Tang Guang turned to look at the members of Sacred Flame in the surround, whose expressions drastically changed. Fear was evident on their faces upon facing his killing intent.</p><p>“Aren’t we gonna annihilate them completely?”</p><p>“They don’t need to live since we’ve killed Vulcan and their highest executives,” Mo Awu replied in a deep voice. “Else, our Sect is gonna have some future troubles if there are some braindead shits who want to avenge Vulcan later.”</p><p>Tang An suddenly emerged out of the blue still wearing her bronze mask. She lightly shook her head and said, “Sect Master may be satisfied by killing Vulcan. But I think he’ll be angry if we were to wipe out nearly 2,000 people of Sacred Flame here. I think we might as well recycle them. As long as we control their lives, we can use them to handle some issues in the future.”</p><p>“Let me do it, then!”</p><p>Kuwako laughed loudly, and her tender figure suddenly floated into the air. She then looked at the fearful 2,000 members of Sacred Flame, who looked vigilant for all possible dangers, and shouted, “You all have seen our power. We’d originally planned to wipe out you all to accompany your highest executives and Vulcan to Hell. But now, we changed our decision and decided to give you a chance to live. Those of you who put down your resistance and submit, I’ll be responsible for your lives and you’ll become the peripheral members of Tang Sect from now on. But those who don’t, then today will be your time of death!”</p><p>“Bastards!”</p><p>“You’re all despicable!”</p><p>“Fight them!”</p><p>Tens of Sacred Flame’s experts floated to the air, nearly all of them seeming to have the intention of perishing together as they bolted toward Kuwako.</p><p>A hint of disdain flashed in the corner of Kuwako’s mouth. She instantly unleashed her immortal sword as it turned into hundreds of meters of sword light that struck several Sacred Flame’s experts instantly. At the same time, Tang An also moved in a flash. Both women had recently broken through into the Spirit Formation Stage and possessed powerful strength. Two of them taking action was simply a lopsided slaughter. It took them only half a minute to slaughter all the Sacred Flame’s experts who resisted.</p><p>“Who else wanna die? We’ll help with that,” Kuwako shouted fiercely. “I repeat. Those who don’t wanna die, throw away your weapons and sit cross-legged on the ground!”</p><p>Kuwako and Tang An had greatly deterred and scared the nearly 2,000 experts of Sacred Flame Organization out of their wits by their killing spree. Not to mention that there were also more tens of experts in the surroundings staring at them. Finally, all of them submitted to Kuwako’s orders, throwing their weapons and sitting cross-legged on the ground.</p><p>Many of them had witnessed the level of power unleashed by Tang Sect’s experts during the battle against the Celestial Wizard Clan. These people were simply ultimate killing machines, and each of them was 100 times stronger than them. Aside from being ruthless and merciless, they killed people without batting an eye as though they were killing chickens. Going against the order would very likely make them end up slaughtered completely, just like the woman said.</p><p>None of them wanted to die. No matter what, being alive was much better than dying. It was the truest portrayal in the minds of these nearly 2,000 members of Sacred Flame at this moment.</p><p>Kuwako happily nodded and then loudly said, “Lower your mind defense and accept the seal I’ll cast on you! Those who refuse will be instantly beheaded with all your limbs severed before you become a meal for the sharks!”</p><p>2 days later.</p><p>It took exactly 2 days for Kuwako to cast a seal on the 1,762 experts of Sacred Flame. In other words, the lives of these 1,762 experts were in Kuwako’s hands from now on.</p><p>A thought from her was enough to decide whether they were lived or died.</p><p>The other disciples of Tang Sect were envious. They knew that Kuwako was the only person who had this Soul Ruling technique. Even though they also wanted to have some members of Sacred Flame under their control, they didn’t have the ability to do so.</p><p>During these two days, the Dark Shaman clansmen were all gathered on a small dirt slope. They also witnessed the full destruction of the Sacred Flame Organization and the fearsome strength of the Tang Sect disciples. Aside from Singluen, all of them were worried and restless that they would also end up like those from the Sacred Flame, being either be killed mercilessly or controlled by that woman.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
