Tang Xiu may be wealthy, but he still had to plan further for the future, as money itself was the minimum foundation one must have to develop further.</p><p>As the clock hit two in the morning, the trio ended their discussion. A round of screening had been done, but there were still many companies portfolios remaining, many of which hadn’t had its details investigated yet.</p><p>“How about sending our men to investigate them first, Boss? Or, do you want to hire some famous international private investigator firms?” The easy-going and extroverted Andy looked somewhat different tonight as she rarely spoke except for expressing her ideas.</p><p>“I don’t trust those international private investigator firms. There’s a chance those survey companies are deeply related to some major companies. Chance is that the Big Boss behind them is the same person. I’ll send our own people to investigate these companies,” said Tang Xiu.</p><p>“But I’m afraid we won’t have enough time if you send our own people for the investigation, though.” Kang Xia interjected.</p><p>“Before I went to Japan, I might still be worried about the lack of funds we might face in the later period, but the concern is all gone now,” said Tang Xiu smilingly. “Besides, our HQ and industrial park in Shanghai haven’t been finished yet, so there’s no way we can go fully operational in the next year, meaning that the output of our various products is still not much as well. Therefore, we’re gonna play a time-delaying card for now. Even if we do strike the deals with some of these foreign companies, the delivery date of the products will be set to a year later.”</p><p>“Did you get some great fortune from the campaign in Japan, by chance?” asked Kang Xia curiously.</p><p>Tang Xiu thought for a moment before he took a set of jewelry from the interspatial ring and gave it to Kang Xia. “You can say the harvest is just great. I’m sure anyone who sees the wealth I’ve obtained will be shocked. Well, take this set of jewelry. It’s for you.”</p><p>Kang Xia’s eyes lit up. She never liked wearing precious jewelry at ordinary times, but the one before her eyes really attracted her. The crown inlaid with jewels and a necklace decorated with emeralds, with blue diamonds on a set of earrings, paired with a couple of bracelets made of jade. Although Kang Xia had no idea the valuation of jadeites and diamonds, she was perfectly sure that this set of jewelry would definitely be very valuable and roughly estimated that its value would definitely not be lower than 10 figures.</p><p>“Boss…”</p><p>A faint voice with a bit of hesitation came from Andy.</p><p>Tang Xiu turned to her and found that she was looking at the set of jewelry in Kang Xia’s hand with a yearning face. Then, he immediately smiled and spoke to her, “What is it? You seem to not be in a good mood all night. But relax, you’ll have yours too.”</p><p>Andy looked stiffened and hesitated for a long while. Then, she stutteringly spoke, “I… I want you to… prescribe medicine for me… but I’m afraid… you’ll be angry.”</p><p>“Prescribing medicine for you?” Tang Xiu was stunned, whereas Kang Xia wore a strange expression.</p><p>Andy took a deep breath and pulled out her courage to continue, “I like you, Boss. I’ve never seen a man better than you. Happiness fills me up every time I see you, and I’m anxious and restless if I can’t see you for a long time. I know my status isn’t high enough to be worthy of you, but I think I have the right to pursue my own happiness. Chief has already become your woman, so take me in too.”</p><p><em>Cough, cough…</em></p><p>Tang Xiu coughed twice and took out another set of jewelry directly from the interspatial ring. After handing it to Andy, he said, “You also know that I have some women already. Too many, even. Andy, you’re no less beautiful than Kang Xia and just a different type of beauty. That’s why I think you should pursue your own happiness and find a man who is dedicated to you only.”</p><p>Andy stubbornly shook her head. “But Chief can find her happiness in you, so can I.”</p><p>Tang Xiu turned to Kang Xia and said, “You help her to be sensible and clear her mind.”</p><p>Having said that, he strode out of the study and then realized that Kang Xia wouldn’t sleep with him tonight, so he took a shower and went straight to bed after returning to his bedroom.</p><p>Early the next morning.</p><p>The first wisp of sunshine had just risen from the east when Tang Xiu woke up. Instead of getting straight to practice after getting up, he just slowly sat on the bed and picked the mobile phone on the bedside table, dialed Hao Lei’s cell number and spoke, “Come to Star City to see me as fast as possible. Also, release a press conference in the name of Grand Fortune Jewelry that the company will hold a large-scale auction in Shanghai on December 1st. Also, invite jewelry collectors from all over the world and local folks alike who love antiques and curios. But keep in mind to make the announcement as bombastic and loud as possible. Additionally, announce to the outside world that all the guests are required to have at least the minimum of 9 figures in liquid cash when participating in the auction.”</p><p>“A minimum of 100 million in liquid cash?” Hao Lei exclaimed. “Isn’t it too high a threshold, Sect Master? There may be a lot of billionaires out there, but what you’re asking for is the available liquid cash! Also, do we… have so many good things to auction?”</p><p>“You don’t need to be concerned about the articles for the auction. You’ll know when you come to Star City,” replied Tang Xiu.</p><p>Hao Lei knew Tang Xiu well. He never did anything that he wasn’t able to handle, so she said, “I’ll rush over to Star City right away, Sect Master. I’ll have the announcement enter the news on the road. I promise those filthy rich all over the world will learn about this unprecedented grand auction. That’s right, any other requirement with the funds pertaining to the publicity?”</p><p>“I’ll give 1 billion for it,” said Tang Xiu.</p><p>Hao Lei’s breathing turned rough and she replied in a deep voice, “1 billion yuan is enough, Sect Master.”</p><p>Tang Xiu then hung up and left the bed to take a shower. Just as he came to the living room on the first floor, he saw Kang Xia nesting on the sofa while reading documents, with the fragrance of dishes fluttering from the kitchen. To his surprise, when he set his sight on the kitchen, it wasn’t the housekeeper who did the cooking but Andy, who was wearing an apron while humming some pong songs.</p><p>“Hey, what’s up here?” Tang Xiu went to Kang Xia’s front and asked with a look of surprise.</p><p>A strange smile appeared on the corner of Kang Xia’s mouth as she replied, “It’s nothing! I just admonished Andy last night but it didn’t turn out well, so I told her that if she really wants to be your woman, she needs to be great both in ‘drilling and cooking’. She won’t have a problem with the former since she has been traveling with me literally everywhere in the past few years, so her experience on that one is remarkable enough with tons of insight in which she can be independent on that one. But as for the kitchen…”</p><p>Tang Xiu blinked with understanding but asked with a strange expression, “She doesn’t know how to cook or what?”</p><p>“Ah, hehe, I’m not 100% sure about that, either.” Kang Xia laughed and said, “In any case, I’ve never seen her cook.”</p><p>Tang Xiu felt rather relieved inwardly and a beaming smile appeared on his handsome face, raising a thumbs up and praising her. “That was a great idea. I’m sure she’ll be able to give it up as long as she doesn’t know how to cook. Well, Kang Xia, find some outstanding talents for her too. I’m sure someone she likes will appear.”</p><p>The smile on Kang Xia’s face turned more evident, but she didn’t reply to Tang Xiu. Instead, she shot her pretty eyes to the kitchen as though she had already smelled the fragrance of the dishes.</p><p>Suddenly, Tang An appeared out of the blue. She didn’t even glance at Kang Xia but cupped her fists and directly spoke to Tang Xiu, “Long Hanwen is here, Grand Master.”</p><p>Tang Xiu nodded in response and came out of the living room hall. Just as he came out, he saw Long Hanwen coming out from the car with looming killing intent on his solemn face.</p><p>“Uncle Long.”</p><p>Long Hanwen nodded to him in response and said, “There’s something I must discuss with you, Tang Xiu.”</p><p>“Let’s head inside,” said Tang Xiu.</p><p>Quickly after, both men came to the study on the second floor. When they just took a seat, Kang Xia entered with a tray of fragrant tea and served them. She then left the room and closed the door.</p><p>Long Hanwen took back his gaze from the door and sighed in praise. “You’re really blessed. Kang Xia is such a great woman!”</p><p>“Surely you wouldn’t come over just to praise Kang Xia.” Tang Xiu smiled slightly.</p><p>The old man’s expression turned solemn and he looked at Tang Xiu, inquisitively asking, “I just wanna know, how do you plan to deal with this U.S Harbo Group?”</p><p>“Well, Kang Xia has informed those from the U.S Harbo Group that the Magnificent Tang Corp. will never do business with them,” said Tang Xiu.</p><p>“Just that?” Long Hanwen frowned.</p><p>“What do you think then, Uncle Long?” asked Tang Xiu back with a meaningful tone and expression.</p><p>Long Hanwen was reticent for half a minute and then spoke with a bit of killing intent contained in his tone, “I want the ones responsible for injuring Zhengyu to be punished! I may have sent someone to beat him up and maim him. That guy is still in custody, but there are others who instigated him, borrowing his hand to beat someone else. I can never swallow my anger if I don’t make them pay some price!”</p><p>“So the reason you haven’t targeted these instigators yet is that you’re wary of the Magnificent Tang Corporation, then?” asked Tang Xiu.</p><p>“That’s correct,” said Long Hanwen directly.</p><p>Tang Xiu took a deep breath and his expression turned serious. Then, he solemnly spoke, “Uncle Long, I accept your kindness. This issue is far from over since the other party severely injured Long Zhengyu right in our turf. However, we can’t just exact revenge and retaliate openly as I need to maintain the reputation of the Magnificent Tang Corporation as well.”</p><p>“Then, what plans you have in mind?” asked Long Hanwen.</p><p>“There are too many companies all over the world that want to cooperate with my company. Even 17 of them come from the U.S.,” said Tang Xiu with a sneer. “These 17 companies may look to be harmonious on the surface, but they are fighting in the back. Kang Xia herself has sorted out the portfolios and information on these 17 companies and gave them to me, so I know that the Harbo Group has secretly been having some disputes and clashes with three other companies and apparently, they always have the upper hand.</p><p>“If these three companies can join hands to deal with the Harbo Group, I believe this company will face quite some hard times, and I can guarantee the people from this company, especially those instigators, will find it impossible to leave Star City and China unharmed.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
