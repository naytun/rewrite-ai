The overwhelming might displayed by the Great Tang Empire made him apprehensive and fearful. However, he still had two trump cards at hand that kept him from withdrawing to the Nine Nether Underworld.</p><p>The first trump card was the great array he arranged outside Yama Island. It had a total of 18 layers, with each layer more powerful than the previous one. Unless the attacker had power comparable to an Immortal, it was impossible for anyone to destroy them.</p><p>The second trump card was his own strength. Although he had yet to reach the Immortal Stage, his strength was comparable to a Great Ascension Stage cultivator. With his strength, he was still able to fight back against this army of tens of thousands of cultivators.</p><p>After spending some time observing the situation, King Yama noticed that the strongest ones among the Great Tang Empire’s experts were only at the Nascent Soul Stage. However, these Nascent Soul Stage experts were all very young. Thus he became fearful and suspected that there were likely some more powerful existences among their ranks. If his suspicion was right, then how high these people’s cultivation level could be?</p><p>“What exactly is this guy doing, King Yama?”</p><p>Black fox, who stood on the left rear of King Yama, inquisitively asked while her eyes fixed on the holographic screen.</p><p>King Yama shifted his attention to the screen Black Fox’s finger pointed. He slightly creased his brows upon seeing a young man giving off a scholarly aura.</p><p><em>Don’t tell me this guy is trying to crack my arrays?</em></p><p><em>The layout of the arrays shrouding the 1st island may be simple, but no ordinary cultivator can ever crack it. These arrays can never be broken unless an expert comparable to the Spirit Formation Stage uses a top-grade magic weapon and bombards them for a very long time.</em></p><p><em>However, this brat is likely only at the Nascent Soul Stage. There’s no way he can possibly understand arrays, right? Let alone crack the arrays I’ve arranged?</em></p><p>After he thought up to this point, King Yama let out a contemptuous look and lightly said, “He’s just pretending and showing off. Looking at his appearance, he must be the commander of this army. Still, he’s too young and just a boy. How can he break the array I’ve arranged here?”</p><p>“He’s trying to crack the arrays?” Black Fox muttered incredulously.</p><p>“Meh, what a wasted effort.” King Yama sneered. “Might as well let this punk study the arrays I’ve arranged here, so they will be struck with fear and retreat earlier.”</p><p>Black Fox smiled in response and respectfully said, “King Yama, the arrays you set up here are definitely profound and overwhelmingly powerful. Let alone this youngling, even a more powerful expert won’t be able to shake these arrays in the slightest no matter how hard he wants to crack them.”</p><p>“That’s right!”</p><p>The other 17 people nodded and concurred with Black Fox’s words.</p><p>“Let’s wait and see, then!” King Yama smilingly said, “They’ll definitely try to strike the arrays. Still, they have tens of thousands of people. If all of them attack together, it will take a while before they can break the arrays covering the 1st hidden island.”</p><p>Suddenly, 5 seconds after he finished speaking, another scene transpired on the holographic screen. The array shield that covered the island that looked like a snow and ice scene quickly melted and dissipated. The layer of the array quickly vanished without a trace in just a few breaths after.</p><p>“What exactly happened?” With a strange expression, Black Fox’s voice inquired.</p><p>King Yama’s face darkened. Ashamed out of anger, he tried hard to suppress his uneasy feelings. He just watched and jeered at the efforts of this youth, yet the array was broken by him alone just after he finished speaking.</p><p>That’s right, the array just cracked. It was done without using any force and was easily broken just by cracking its principle.</p><p><em>This punk… damn him!</em></p><p>King Yama pressed his boiling anger and tried hard not to flip out in front of his underlings. However, he couldn’t conceal the thick murderous intent in his eyes when he saw Tang Ahlang on the screen.</p><p>On the 1st concealed island.</p><p>Tang Ahlang wiped the sweat off his forehead and took a long, deep breath. Although he had been studying arrays diligently in recent times and had learned many profound principles of arrays, it was still a bit difficult for him to break these arrays by himself. If it wasn’t for his Master teaching him some array principles that happened to have some similarities with these arrays, he wouldn’t have been able to crack the array in front of him in such a short time.</p><p>While standing in mid-air, Tang Ahlang stretched his body and then looked around at the complete scene in front before he said in a deep voice, “All the army soldiers, heed my order! Capture all the members of the Darkwind on this island. Kill anyone without mercy should they fight back!”</p><p>In an instant, tens of thousands of soldiers on Aerogliders launched attacks against the array in an orderly manner. But the entire army formation was still orderly despite all of them attacking from all sides.</p><p>“Surrender! Or all of you will die!”</p><p>A billowing, cold, and grim shout came from Tang Jin’s mouth. In the next moment, 50,000 soldiers of the Martial Army shouted the same line in unison. The billowing shout was deafening and drilled straight into the sky.</p><p>On the island.</p><p>Black Snake’s face was grim and frosty. A thick murderous intent flashed in his bewitching eyes. He firmly believed that King Yama would lead the rest to save him because he was the most faithful subordinate of the King.</p><p>“Everyone, charge with me and kill them all! King Yama will definitely lead the rest here.”</p><p>Black Snake roared. A dark scythe suddenly appeared in his hand and its blade light suddenly flashed as he brandished it. The tens of black-uniformed youth soldiers of the Martial Army at the vanguard position swiftly unleashed and brandished their magical swords in a neat and orderly manner.</p><p><em>Slash…</em></p><p>Just like a knife chopping on tofu, Black Snake’s scythe was instantly cut into tens of pieces, but the violent sword beam kept slashing forward without a slight pause and hit Black Snake in a flash. Despite having a powerful cultivation level comparable to the Nascent Soul Stage, Black Snake was hit badly and left tens of bleeding wounds on his body.</p><p>“FUCK!”</p><p>Black Snake roared violently and fled.</p><p>These teenagers’ individual strength was just average, but they were adept in joint strike combos. Although most of them were only at the Golden Core Stage, their joint attack combo sharply increased their striking power by several folds and became more powerful than the strikes of a Nascent Soul Stage expert.</p><p>Tang Jin’s figure flickered from a distance and instantly appeared at the battle scene. With a contemptuous look on his boyish face, he shouted aloud, “You’ve entered our battlefield, you can never escape even if your strength is ten times stronger. Cease your resistance and be captured, else death will be your only option!”</p><p><em>Bang, bang, bang…</em></p><p>Black Snake kept trying to break through in several directions, but he still ended up getting slashed by the legionnaires from all sides. What shocked him the most was the deaths of the hundreds of men under him in just a few minutes, while the remaining men who were still alive gave up and directly surrendered.</p><p>“Your bullying is far too excessive!”</p><p>Black Snake took out a black banner from his sleeve. Waves of chilling wind blew as his intermittent voice spelled an incantation. Shortly after, unending streams of vengeful spirits drilled out of the ground until the number reached tens of thousands. These spirits’ strength, however, was very weak, most of them were only comparable to a Foundation Establishment Stage cultivator.</p><p>“Hmph, a dying dog that will collapse with a single blow.” Tang Jin sneered. He then looked at Tang Ahlang as the latter sent him a voice transmission. “Keep him alive and capture him with an Immortal Shackle.”</p><p>Tang Jin’s expression shifted. He immediately waved his hand to signal his legionaries to kill the spirits. At the same time, he took out a black rope from his sleeve, chanted an incantation and then threw the black rope towards Black Snake in an instant.</p><p>“What the hell is this thing?”</p><p>Black Snake felt like he was crashing into a glacier hole at this time. He clearly sensed the enormous aura of a cultivator that was much stronger than him from the black-uniformed teenager who was likely an officer. However, he was still hoping that King Yama would rush out to save him, so he gritted his teeth and went all out desperately, casting the dark mist into a black dragon that aggressively bared its fangs and talons to clash with the rope.</p><p>“Destroy…”</p><p>Tang Jin let out a cold shout as he unleashed his immortal sword. It streaked fast and turned into a beam that smashed the black dragon instantly. The black rope quickly revolved around Black Snake and wrapped him tightly.</p><p>“You wanna capture me? DREAM ON!”</p><p>Black Snake quickly surged his Netherworld Force frantically and desperately struggled for a while. But the longer he struggled, the tighter the bind of the black rope and the weaker his struggle was. Shortly after, he sensed that a dark shadow suddenly appeared in front of him. A heavy blow then hit his forehead, causing him to faint instantly.</p><p>Tang Jin coldly smiled. Although this Dragon Cord was not an immortal artifact, it was still a top-grade magical tool refined by Elder Ji Chimei. Unless one had strength comparable to an Immortal, it was impossible for him to break free once he got bound by it.</p><p>A few minutes later.</p><p>All 50,000 soldiers of the Martial Army had landed on the island. After finishing setting up temporary camps, Tang Jin, Tang Mu, Tang Shui, Tang Huo, and Tang Tu quickly convened with Tang Ahlang. As Tang Jin threw Black Snake in front of Tang Ahlang, he saluted and asked, “Do you have any instructions as to how we’re going to deal with this person, Commander?”</p><p>Tang Ahlang slightly smiled in response. He took out a silver needle and pierced an acupoint on Black Snake’s body. Several seconds later, Black Snake slowly came to his senses, but his expression changed greatly after he saw the people around him. After seemingly recalling something, he suddenly looked up and shouted fiercely, “My Lord King Yama, why didn’t you save us?!!”</p><p>On Yama Island.</p><p>King Yama stood in front of a holographic screen with a complicated look on his grotesque face. His 18 henchmen were his most trusted people. But even though this man was not one of them, he was well aware that Black Snake’s loyalty to him was unquestionable.</p><p>It wasn’t like he didn’t want to save him, but it was rather that he didn’t dare leave Yama Island carelessly. He didn’t know whether there was anyone else hiding among the ranks in the Great Tang Empire army in the dark. In case a large number of powerful experts were really hiding, he wouldn’t be able to guarantee a safe escape even for himself.</p><p>Hence, he could only give up on him. He didn’t want to trade his own safety or the safety of his trusted henchmen to save another subordinate that had lost any chance to escape.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
