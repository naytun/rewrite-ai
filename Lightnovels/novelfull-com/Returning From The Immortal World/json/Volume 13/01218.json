He knew how difficult it was to concoct this pill since the most primer ingredient to enhance the efficacy of this medicine was the blood essence from the heart of its maker.</p><p>“You are not to do anything that benefits others but is harmful to yourself again in the future.”</p><p>After taking the pill, Tang Xiu gently hugged Gu Yan’er and spoke solemnly.</p><p>A glint of happiness flashed in Gu Yan’er’s eyes. Although she promised in a soft voice, she didn’t take the admonishment to heart. She was willing to go to any lengths even though it would greatly harm herself as long as it could help Tang Xiu. Just like what she did in the past…</p><p>On the winding mountain pathway, Tang Xiu and Gu Yan’er walked side by side and headed towards the seaside where the exquisite pagoda was located, both unfazed by the cold wind blowing around them.</p><p>“Yan’er, the Immortal Demon Pill is an elixir usually taken by top demons in the Demon Realm who cultivate physical refinement. The medicinal ingredients needed to concoct it are very precious, even when I stayed in the Immortal World for millenniums and infiltrated the Demon Realm many times, it still cost me great efforts to get the medicinal herbs to concoct this pill. How did you get them?” asked Tang Xiu.</p><p>“I obtained them from the Immortal Lyceum.” Gu Yan’er smiled and answered lightly.</p><p>The Immortal Lyceum?</p><p>Tang Xiu’s expression changed slightly and a complex look appeared in his eyes. Back when he was a Supreme in the Immortal World and possessed fearsome power, he could face countless Immortal and Demons unfazed, yet there was one person he always entertained remorseful feeling towards. That person was exactly the Master of this Immortal Lyceum, an extraordinary and peerlessly talented Perfected Golden Immortal, Apotheosis Immortal Bella Fern Regalia.</p><p>Back in the past, he devoted his whole love only for Xue Qingcheng, being obstinate that it was enough for him to have one woman since he had already found the true love of his life. It was also this reason that made him remain indifferent towards her despite her becoming a laughingstock in the Immortal World due to her efforts of pursuing him for thousands of years.</p><p>His rejection was, however, ineffective and he could only keep avoiding her.</p><p>Tang Xiu took a deep breath and asked, “Is she… okay?”</p><p>Gu Yan’er knew who he was asking about. There was a bit of admiration in her eyes as she nodded and answered, “She was great then, at least on the surface. After you went through that accident, she spent hundreds of years to break into your Immortal Sphere where you’d been in seclusion and brought all the treasures you’d collected in your treasure vault for 10,000 years. She brought it to the Immortal Lyceum and created an area there that copied the scenery of your seclusion abode. I received her hospitality when I first visit her Immortal Lyceum and spent a century there to read the classics collection you spent 10,000 years collecting. But…”</p><p>Tang Xiu furrowed his brows and asked, “But what?”</p><p>Gu Yan’er forced a smile and went on, “But I kept having a feeling that she seemed to be planning a huge move. I have no idea what exactly it was, but she tried to get me to work with her. Unfortunately, I was in a hurry to find you then, so I declined.”</p><p>Tang Xiu frowned and then shook his head. “No. She’s not the subtle and deep kind of person. Something like coming up with any big plan is not like her given her fiery temper. Alright, let’s drop talking about her. It feels like ages ago since the last time I practiced swordplay. Do you still remember the sword dance I taught you?”</p><p>Gu Yan’er’s eyes lit up and she smilingly nodded. “Yeah, I still remember it.”</p><p>“Accompany me to practice some swordplay,” said Tang Xiu. “I’ll leave Nine Dragons Island tomorrow for Shanghai to attend the auction.”</p><p>Gu Yan’er curtly complied and then asked curiously, “Master, I heard from Xiaoxue that you’re going to hold an unprecedented auction in Shanghai. Is it true?”</p><p>“Yeah. The number of cultivators our Tang Sect grooms will only keep increasing and it’s very likely that we’ll need a colossal number of cultivation resources for their consumption annually. The plan I made this time is to secure massive funds in a short time before I fully immerse myself in cultivation.”</p><p>“Are you going to cultivate in the exquisite pagoda too at that time?” asked Gu Yan’er with bright eyes.</p><p>“Yeah!” Tang Xiu nodded.</p><p>Hearing his reply, Gu Yan’er looked excited and the feeling still lingered in her after they came to the beach.</p><p>Dream Butterfly Sword Dance!</p><p>It was a swordsmanship style Tang Xiu created when boredom struck him back in the Immortal World. The foundation of this swordsmanship was created after observing the gracefully dancing butterflies, which possess light and graceful stances and movements. The two butterflies merrily rose and descended as though they were dancing partners, but their movement was the resemblance of dance fighting style.</p><p>After treading along the waves for just half a minute, Tang Xiu and Gu Yan’er appeared on the sea surface a kilometer away. As both took out their respective immortal sword, their figures blurred. The scene made them look like a celestial couple dancing in the air cheerfully while waving their swords under the baptism of the sun.</p><p>“The Dance of the Golden Butterfly.”</p><p>Gu Yan’er’s graceful figure bent 60 degrees to the back before her sword flickered and created images of continuous streams of sword tips, while the hovering stream of energy formed a golden light butterfly. As she rose tens of meters above the sea, thousands of golden butterflies fluttered around her as though they were dancing happily.</p><p>“The Longing of the Silver Butterfly.”</p><p>Tang Xiu’s figure wildly spun around while maintaining the same height as that of Gu Yan’er. Along with the flowing of the sword tips movements, a silver light butterfly appeared out of the blue in the sky and gathered with thousands of golden butterflies.</p><p>At the beach kilometers away from the scene.</p><p>Ji Chimei and Gu Xiaoxue were standing side by side wearing surprised expressions. They felt that the sword dance performed by Tang Xiu and Gu Yan’er was truly soul-captivating and thrilling, beautiful and deeply intoxicating.</p><p>“What a beautiful sight to behold.”</p><p>Gu Yin’s figure flickered from the distance. When she descended down next to Gu Xiaoxue, she muttered, “Yinyin also wants to learn this sword dance. It’s really beautiful.”</p><p>Gu Xiaoxue turned to her and looked at her smilingly. “Little Martial Aunt, do you want to learn this sword dance and hope to find a good husband in the future so you can practice it together with him?”</p><p>“Nah. Yinyin doesn’t want to find any good prince.” Gu Yin shyly replied, “Master is always very nice to me. I want to be just like Big Senior Sister and be able to practice such swordplay with Master.”</p><p>After hearing her reply, Gu Xiaoxue immediately smiled and shifted back her vision to the duo practicing swordplay above the sea with a heart full of envy. She also wanted to learn this sword dance and practice it with her Grand Master, Tang Xiu. But she knew for sure that such a luxury was like a faraway dream that she would never be able to realize.</p><p>The butterflies died as the swords descended.</p><p>While riding the immortal sword above the sea surface, Tang Xiu wore a similar expression as Gu Yan’er as they smiled at each other. Then, Tang Xiu said, “Go back and continue healing your injuries. The faster you heal the stronger the Tang Sect will become. I’m looking forward to you being able to instruct the Tang Sect’s disciples in cultivation after you recover.”</p><p>“Yan’er still retains the power of an Immortal, Master. I can still help Tang Sect’s disciples progress rapidly even if I have to expend a bit of my immortal spiritual force.” Gu Yan’er smiled.</p><p>“No.” Tang Xiu hurriedly said, “You must not use your Immortal spiritual energy before you’ve fully healed. This plane is devoid of any immortal spiritual force. Every bit you use will still reduce your power. Besides, we need to return to the Immortal World in the future and I still need your protection at that time.”</p><p>“Rest assured, Master! I’m aware of it.” Gu Yan’er nodded with a smile.</p><p>Tang Xiu nodded in response before shifting his vision to the shore and then said, “After some time, I’m going to take the Tang Family to Nine Dragons Island and train them to be cultivators. I’ll leave them on Earth if they choose to stay and take them with us to the Immortal World if they choose to do so.”</p><p>Gu Yan’er thought for a while and then said, “Alright, then I’ll set up a separate area on Nine Dragons Island to house the juniors of the Tang Family. But Master, you should also be aware that there’s a chance they would make some trouble here if they learn of your identity in the sect and use your position as Sect Master, right?”</p><p>“Don’t worry about that! The number of core members of the Tang Family won’t exceed 30 people.” Tang Xiu said, “I’ll warn those who do so and throw them into training camps to get the normal drill. They will stay on Nine Dragons Island if they can endure it and will be sent back to China if they fail to do so. There will be no privilege nor special care given to them on Nine Dragons Island.”</p><p>“Well, Yan’er is just sticking her nose and being a busybody, then. Master is Master, as always. You’ve thought it through completely.” Gu Yan’er chuckled. “Anyhow, Yan’er is really happy now since there’s no need for me to ponder about things with you around, Master. Before I met you, Yan’er was always fearful and cautious, like walking on thin ice.”</p><p>Tang Xiu sighed since he knew what kind of efforts and price she had to pay. It was all because of him. Else, it would have been very easy for her to live a comfortable life in the Immortal World given her talent and strength.</p><p>“Yan’er!”</p><p>Tang Xiu hugged her shoulders gently with a self-reproaching expression.</p><p>Gu Yan’er took advantage of the opportunity to lean on Tang Xiu’s shoulders. She shook her head and smilingly said, “Master, Yan’er will always feel happy no matter how hard or tired Yan’er has been since everything is for you. As long as you don’t abandon Yan’er in the future, Yan’er will keep following you everywhere even if you become the enemy of the whole world.”</p><p>“Master will never leave you again, Yan’er,” said Tang Xiu.</p><p>It was a long way to tread on and the responsibility was heavy—something Tang Xiu was aware of along with the incrasing heavy pressure on his shoulders. After releasing Gu Yan’er, he entered the exquisite pagoda with her and stayed there until the next morning and accompanied her for breakfast.</p><p>“I want to go with you.”</p><p>Xue Yu, who had been cultivating in Nine Dragons Island, suddenly spoke.</p><p>Tang Xiu put down his chopsticks and asked, “Have you stabilized your cultivation?”</p><p>“Yeah. It’s been stabilized. The power I can unleash is at the early-stage of Spirit Formation now. Yan’er has taught me a lot recently and I should be able to break through to the late-stage of Spirit Formation in about six months if there’s no accident.”</p><p>Tang Xiu thought about it and asked again, “Do you have anything to tend to back in China?”</p><p>Xue Yu shook her head. “There’s nothing else apart from checking the business affairs.”</p><p>“Xue Yu, you’re very strong now, but you lack fighting experience.” Tang Xiu said, “Well, it’s your call, of course, but I suggest that you don’t go back to China and head to the United States instead! Mo Awu’s team has arrived there to carry out a secret mission. You’re much stronger than them, so you can help them greatly while also training yourself and reaping more experiences.”</p><p>The United States?</p><p>Xue Yu gave it a thought and then nodded. “No problem. Then I’ll go to America.”</p><p>Recently, she learned a lot of things from Gu Yan’er, many of which were related to Tang Xiu. She finally knew that they would face incomparably fearsome enemies later, so she wanted to help Tang Xiu, provided that he needed it.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
