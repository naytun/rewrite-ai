How many fights and battles had he gone through in his life? Thus, he decided to gamble. Instead of trying to escape to the Nine Nether Underworld, he would rather choose to battle his way out. He was confident that he could save his own hide even if all his subordinates were to die.</p><p>Taking out a pair of dark gloves and putting them on, he pulled a soft sword from his waist. A sword image flashed and the sword eventually became as hard as sharp steel.</p><p>“Tang Xiu.”</p><p>King of Hell took a deep breath and fierce light overflowed from his eyes as he said in a deep voice, “We shall meet on the 9th hidden island 3 days later. I want to witness how powerful the might of the Great Tang Empire is over there.”</p><p>“You know, it’s much better to run into such a chance than choosing an auspicious date for this one. Why should we wait for three days?” Tang Xiu slightly smiled in response. “Why don’t I break the remaining two arrays so we can have a good game on the sea surface?”</p><p>King Yama said aloud, “Today is not a convenient time as I need to adjust my strength to the peak condition. You can choose to storm my Yama Island now and I can only retreat with all my men and wait to return to this world in the future. You can shelter this world for now, but what about thousands of years later? Do you still have the ability to shelter them?”</p><p><em>Thousands of years later?</em></p><p>Tang Xiu couldn’t help but feel shaken inwardly. He was well aware of how true King of Hell’s words were. He would leave Earth for the Immortal World 2 years later. If this guy were to retreat, it would be equal to letting the tiger breed and leaving an impending calamity behind, which undoubtedly would become a wicked and evil tumor for mankind on Earth.</p><p>He thought about it and continuously weighed the issue.</p><p>Eventually, Tang Xiu nodded and slowly said, “Then I shall meet you on the 9th hidden island as per your choice. You have my word on that. If I don’t see you there 3 days later, then don’t blame me for using every power I have to kill you even if I must chase you down to the Nine Nether Underworld.”</p><p>Contempt and disdain flashed in King Yama’s eyes. Since when the Nine Nether Underworld was an easy place to enter? Ghost cultivators would face no problem, but cultivators with other cultivation systems would lose the support of the Heaven and Earth energy once they entered the Nine Nether Underworld, and they would lose some strength every time they consumed their power. Not even Immortals were able to kill him in a short time should they enter the Nine Nether Underworld. As long as he had a chance to escape, an opportunity would always arise for him to make a comeback.</p><p><em>Pity that there’s no Nine Nether force on Earth, else I could’ve restored my power to the peak. It would’ve been very easy for me to kill anyone at the Crossing Tribulation Stage then.</em></p><p>Feeling a bit regretful inwardly, King Yama watched Tang Xiu’s back as he left with a helpless smile on his demonic and grotesque face.</p><p>White clouds adorned the fine weather and filled the space of the blue sky.</p><p>Walking side by side with Xue Yu, a thoughtful expression was cast on Tang Xiu’s handsome face. It was a no-brainer for anyone with a little brain to realize that King of Hell had some unexpected means at hand, though Tang Xiu had no idea what it was.</p><p>“Are you sure?”</p><p>Xue Yu’s brilliant eyes lingering on Tang Xiu’s face. Her voice was very pleasant, but it couldn’t hide her inquisitive and doubtful tone.</p><p>“This King of Hell did say something reasonable,” Tang Xiu said. “If he were to take his men back to the Nine Nether Underworld immediately and then destroyed the passage between both worlds, it would be difficult for us to have any chance to exterminate him again. He’ll come out once again when we leave and will very likely carry out a crazy retaliation. Those who have a relationship with me may become the targets of his revenge. I can guess that his revenge will be much more fearsome than that of the nine familial exterminations.”</p><p>“Still, he’s the one who chose the time and the location,” Xue Yu replied. “If he were to set up traps on the 9th hidden island in advance, are we going to just jump in like that?”</p><p>“Let’s just say that I can only figure out the counter of every trick he has today.” Tang Xiu forced a smile and said, “But be rest assured, though. I’ll call Yan’er over to deal with him. This King of Hell won’t be able to deal any damage to a Golden Immortal no matter what kind of tricks he’s trying to pull.”</p><p>“That’s a good means, indeed.” Xue Yu immediately understood and said, “But Gu Yan’er is kind of constrained by the laws of Heavenly Dao of this world, though. She’ll be discovered by this world’s Heavenly Dao. If a mishap happens, then…”</p><p>Tang Xiu took a deep breath and suddenly said, “Then I’ll contact Ji Chimei. I have a plan to make her return to the Immortal World first to carry out some preparations over there. A year on Earth is equal to a century in the Immortal World. Ji Chimei will go there in advance, and two years in the Immortal means that she needs to wait for us for 200 years. Letting her go back in advance can be considered that she’ll act as a vanguard for our return.”</p><p>“But will Ji Chimei agree, though?” Xue Yu creased her brows.</p><p>“She will,” Tang Xiu said.</p><p>3 days later.</p><p>Tang Xiu personally took command of the four major armies and occupied the southern part of the 9th island, quietly waiting for the arrival of the Darkwind people. Tang Xiu was perfectly aware that this battle was the last war he’d wage on Earth. After this battle, he could spend the next two years in a safe and secure manner and then leave for the Immortal World after the preparations and the appropriate time came.</p><p>Ji Chimei had received Tang Xiu’s order and arrived 3 days ago. When Tang Xiu told her his plan, she complied without hesitation. She was also well aware of the fact that none of them knew the situation in the Immortal World now. If the Great Tang Empire’s army of hundreds of thousands of people were to arrive in the Immortal World and then run into their mortal archenemies, they would very likely fall into enormous troubles.</p><p>“They’ve come, Master.” Tang Ahlang quickly appeared in front of Tang Xiu riding on an Aeroglider.</p><p>“What about their number?” Tang Xiu narrowed his eyes and asked.</p><p>“From our observation, the vanguard should be around 5,000 people, and our intel added that these people should be the Darkwind experts the King of Hell has summoned from all over the world to gather here temporarily. There are also 2 more groups following, about 2,000 strong.”</p><p>Tang Xiu narrowed his eyes and nodded. “That should be all the power the Darkwind can mobilize if my guess is correct. Anyways, have you found this Yama?”</p><p>“We have his portrait painted by Black Snake, but we haven’t found him yet.” Tang Ahlang shook his head and said, “However, given Yama’s strength, he can change his appearance and restrain his aura, which will give us a hard time finding him. Further, Blind Grandma also came and said there’s something she needs to tell you.”</p><p>Tang Xiu’s expression shifted and he immediately ordered, “Bring her over.”</p><p>Old Blind had always been staying on Nine Dragons Island, and she occasionally went to the pocket world to cultivate in seclusion. She was indifferent and rarely bothered to get involved in any other issues. Now that she came here all of a sudden, it was obvious that there was something urgent she needed to report.</p><p>After a short while, Old Blind came to Tang Xiu and said, “There’s a problem in this battle, Your Majesty. I peered into the heavenly secrets and saw a river of blood and littered bodies everywhere. I also saw horrible vengeful spirits and ghosts. The scenes are just like Hell. But I can’t see the ending here due to your existence, so I can only rely on the little bits of divination I’ve done to guess the possibility of bad things that could happen in the following battle.”</p><p>Tang Xiu frowned and turned to look toward the north. With his eyesight, he was already able to see the approaching Darkwind vanguard troops. However, Ji Chimei was already here. With such an Immortal powerhouse, what kind of waves could Yama pull out no matter how fearsome his power was?</p><p>“Old Blind, your warning is duly noted. I won’t take this battle lightly. You can rest assured of it!” Tang Xiu solemnly nodded after being silent for a while.</p><p>“How about giving that 5,000 strong vanguard army to this Old Blind to get rid of, then? I’ve broken through to the Celestial Master Stage after cultivating for years. Even if I’m still far from reaching the Deity Master Stage, I’m just a step away from it. I’d like to see to what extent my strength has reached.”</p><p>Tang Xiu gave it a thought and then nodded. “Well, since Senior wants to act and have some practice, then please do! There will also be a time for you to fight when we go to the Immortal World later.”</p><p>Old Blind slightly smiled. Her body instantly flickered towards the northern side of the 9th hidden island. In a flash, she appeared in front of the 5,000 experts of the Darkwind. Chanting a vicissitude incantation intermittently, a transparent blade light suddenly slashed forward and swept toward the 5,000-strong army.</p><p><em>Puff, puff, puff…</em></p><p>It was but only a single strike, yet only several people were able to streak up into the sky and escape the violent blow among the 5,000-strong army of the Darkwind. The rest were cut into halves and were killed directly no matter how desperately they tried to escape.</p><p>“What power!”</p><p>Everyone present was astonished by the breathtaking blade strike. Such a mighty and berserk power for a frontal clash was the kind of strength that even Xue Yu dared not say she could pull out despite her current strength.</p><p>“DAMN!”</p><p>The black-robed King Yama streaked up into the sky from the troops in the back. He waved the magic staff in his hand and snarled loudly. “Tang Xiu! I never thought you’d be this despicable! We have yet to go to the 9th hidden island, yet your people have already moved to kill my people? You’re shameless and despicable!”</p><p>Tang Xiu rose into the air and sneered. “Your men are already here, which means the battle has already begun. We’ve come to the point where your side or mine will perish, to begin with. You don’t think you’re just gonna have a cup of tea and chat with me, no?”</p><p>King of Hell glared at Tang Xiu and cast a spell. A black fog suddenly burst out and immediately shrouded the 9th hidden island in just a few breaths.</p><p>“So be it. Then let the battle begin! Your Great Tang Empire may have armies of cultivators, but my side isn’t a soft persimmon, either. You want to battle, then a battle you’ll have! Let’s see how many ghosts your men can kill and how disastrous your losses will be!” King of Hell furiously roared as he waved his magic staff more quickly.</p><p>Tang Xiu’s complexion changed. He keenly sensed the change in the surrounding temperature that was reduced by more than 10 degrees in a flash. He could also perceive the lingering smell of vengeful spirits mixed in.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
