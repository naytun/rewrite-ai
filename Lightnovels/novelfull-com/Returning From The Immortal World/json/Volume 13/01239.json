There was no shred of fear on their faces, and they were seemingly in high spirits instead. It could be seen that they would storm over these big men at a moment’s notice once the order was issued.</p><p>Tang Xiu didn’t expect that such a scene would appear in this peaceful age. He could see that this company of boys was almost like wolf cubs with each sending out ferocious vibes.</p><p>“Wang Hu!”</p><p>Tang Xiu waved to Wang Hu. As the half-running to him and then stopping in front of him, he took out a cigarette and threw it to him, smilingly asking, “Summoning lots of boys and making quite a remarkable scene like this. You’re quite awesome, Boy!”</p><p>Wang Hu scratched his head and his ferocious expression changed into a pure and honest smile. “Ah, I don’t deserve the credit, Brother. It’s Ah Lang. All of us are following him.”</p><p>“Ah Lang? Who’s he?” Tang Xiu wondered.</p><p>“He’s our brother, or rather, our leader,” Wang Hu answered. “Unfortunately, he’s kinda unwell, so he can’t come here.”</p><p>His explanation piqued Tang Xiu’s curiosity about this person named Ah Lang. However, it was not an appropriate time to talk about this matter. He then shifted to the tattooed man who looked a bit restless and wore an unsightly expression. He then spoke to the man with a faint smile, “You know, I never wanted to bully anyone, but you deserve to stay behind bars for several years. It never occurred to me that these rascals would call out so many others here. If anything, things have gotten to this point, so I’m gonna ask you first. You stalked me and threatened me, have I made you annoyed or something? Or, do you want to snatch my money?”</p><p>The tattooed man took a deep breath before he immediately revealed his ferocious side and coldly sneered. “I’m coming for your money since we don’t know each other. And you brats, hats’ off to you for pulling out such a stunt and calling these many cubs. I dare you to summon 10 times more, but you still gotta pay some bills to this Big Daddy! Take out 100,000 yuan and I’ll spare you!”</p><p>Tang Xiu asked with a strange expression, “You still wanna mug me even after this kind of scene?”</p><p>Instead of replying, the tattooed man pulled up his jacket and drew a pistol from his waist, followed by the other two men with their pistols. The rest of them quickly drew machetes and wickedly glared at Tang Xiu with hideous grins.</p><p>The nearly hundred boys in the surroundings looked a bit shocked at first, but they just shrugged it off after recalling that they were also armed. Youngsters may have boiling warm blood, but far from being fearless against the real thing. It could be expected that they would flee faster like rabbits once the bullets flew.</p><p>Tang Xiu frowned since the man who drew a pistol behind the tattooed man suddenly gave out a killing aura—something that could only be acquired after killing more than 10 people, or at least, viciously killing some people cruelly.</p><p>“You know, I already called the cops before I left the gas station,” Tang Xiu calmly said. “Now you got guns and you’ll be charged with multiple crimes when the cops arrive.”</p><p>The tattooed man rolled his eyes and sneered. “Heh, we wouldn’t be here if we were scared of the cops. And you, brats! You all had better stop spitting out shits and just follow us. Else, I’ll kill you all!”</p><p>The boys looked a bit scared, but they didn’t flinch at all. They now looked calmer after the brief fear. Especially the tall Wang Long. He raised his machete and angrily glowered. “Hmph, you wanna snatch our bankroller, huh? You must ask the blade in my hands first! Don’t think we’ll be afraid of you since you got guns. How many of us you can guys kill? 10? 20? But the rest of us will definitely grind you to a pulp!”</p><p>Wang Hu also sneered and said, “Yeah! Worse comes to worst, both us will just die together. You dare to snatch our bankroller and take us as your enemies? If we must die, then we die. Life is nothing much compared to money to us.”</p><p>“Yeah! We dare exchange our lives for wealth!”</p><p>“Five grand is worth 10 days to us. It’s worth it to risk our lives for!”</p><p>“F*ck them!”</p><p>“…”</p><p>The nearly 100 boys raved and paced forward step by step, seemingly about to attack at a moment’s notice.</p><p>The tattooed man’s complexion greatly changed and the tens of men he brought looked incredulous. How could they ever imagine that they would bump into this bunch of lunatic boys?</p><p>Were they really not afraid of death?</p><p>After observing these boys, they realized that they should also fear death, but much to their shock, they were just as ready to risk everything for wealth as birds would for food. It was a situation where these boys would directly storm over if any of them pulled the trigger.</p><p><em>What should I do?</em></p><p>Suddenly, the tattooed man felt very vexed as he was unable to advance nor back down.</p><p>Tang Xiu himself could keenly sense the aura of these boys and he was quite shocked inwardly. He didn’t expect that these nearly a hundred boys were so brave, even their original intention was just for money. They were even ready to exchange their lives just for 5,000 yuan.</p><p>Suddenly, the sound of sirens was heard from afar.</p><p>The tattooed man’s expression changed yet again. Although he was a bit vexed, he felt more relieved. It was like the sound of the siren was more like the notification of the arrival of his savior rather than giving him another pressure.</p><p>Hesitation flashed across Wang Hu’s face. He gritted his teeth and threw a look at Tang Xiu and said, “We’re not afraid of death, Brother. But we can’t just be detained in the police station for nothing. Can you… can you give us more money? If you give us some more, we’ll do anything and all of us will accept the risk to be detained in the cops’ den.”</p><p>“Alright. I’ll give 10 times the previous price, then. Is it enough?” Tang Xiu calmly replied.</p><p>Wang Hu clenched his fists and said aloud, “You heard him, Brothers? This big brother is gonna increase our price 10 times. Which means we’ll get 50 grand. But we brothers must be ready to risk everything. If those cops dare to take away this big brother, we’ll storm them over as well!”</p><p>“FIGHT!!!”</p><p>Orderly voices replied loudly.</p><p>Quickly after, six police cars arrived and tens of policemen rushed out of the cars. They began wielding and waving their batons as a middle-aged one, who was their leader, shouted, “ALL OF YOU, DON’T MOVE! Put down all your weapons and squat on the ground, else all of you will be detained in the station!”</p><p>The tattooed man looked excited upon seeing the policeman, but he quickly suppressed it and said aloud, “You finally came, Chief Liu. This boy owes us money and we were just asking him to pay his debt. I never thought that he would call out so many punks here planning to kill us. Please serve justice for us!”</p><p>The middle-aged policeman frowned and a look of disgust flashed across his face. He then shifted to Tang Xiu and prudently observed him before he strode over and asked, “Comrade, are you the person who reported this incident to the police?”</p><p>“I am!” Tang Xiu nodded.</p><p>The middle-aged policeman went on, “I’m Liu Yong, the Police Chief of this city. You said on the phone that you’re a comrade from the Security Department. May I see your credentials?”</p><p>Tang Xiu took out the green book. He casually handed it to the policeman and lightly said, “You know, the cops here truly disappoint me with your slow-moving asses. It’s exactly 36 minutes after I called you, and I even gave you the location in advance. Yet, you took 36 minutes to come here? Your efficiency is truly appalling to the extreme. I really have no idea how you can become the Chief of the Public Security Bureau of this city.”</p><p>The moment Liu Yong saw the green book Tang Xiu took out, his heart jolted and he suddenly went restless after he opened it. He didn’t take Tang Xiu’s warning previously and even drank a cup of tea and smoked in the police station. Only a bit later did he think about taking a squad of policemen to see the situation, which was the reason for their late arrival.</p><p>However, everything was real. This credential couldn’t be more real, which meant that this young man was really someone from the Security Department—a special agent of the state!</p><p><em>This is really bad!</em></p><p>He knew perfectly well about one thing. It would be very likely that he would become the subject of execution. Even if he could save his own sorry ass, he would at least have to suffer quite a lot!</p><p>The moment he came to this thought, he steeled himself and shouted in a heavy voice, “These bastards have assaulted a state cadre! Handcuff and apprehend all of them. I suspect that they are all terrorists, so we’ll interrogate them slowly to make them pay a painful price!”</p><p>“What?!”</p><p>The tattooed man’s complexion changed as disbelief filled his eyes. As he saw the tens of policemen aggressively lunging at his group, a sound of gunfire blasted behind him before he even uttered a word.</p><p><em>Bang…</em></p><p>A fire spark flashed and the muzzle was aimed at Liu Yong. However, Tang Xiu’s finger flicked a silver needle in a flash the moment the spark flashed. The needle directly hit the bullet from the gun bore and made its trajectory pass through the crowd. No one was hurt.</p><p><em>Bam, bam, bam…</em></p><p>The next moment, Tang Xiu moved lightning fast and took out three big men and snatched their guns in nearly the blink of an eye. He then threw the pistols to Liu Yong’s feet and didn’t even hold back his reprimand. “You’re the Chief of the City Police, yet you have no vigilance at all? You’d already be dead if I didn’t take action!”</p><p>The sudden event scared Liu Yong to death. Tang Xiu’s loud reproach after the dust settled pulled him back from his fear. Large drops of sweat could be seen falling from his forehead, but he was not in the mood to even wipe them off. With a feeling that he had just walked away from the gates of Hell, he shot Tang Xiu a look of gratitude and said, “I admit I took it lightly, Leader. Thank you for saving me. You’re Liu Yong’s benefactor from now on.”</p><p>“Hmph. I don’t give a damn about being your benefactor or not!” Tang Xiu coldly snorted and indifferently said, “What I care about is the fact that you have so many gangsters in your jurisdiction! Some of them even have guns. They even dare to target me and rob me of my possessions. If it wasn’t for this group of brave boys who stood up for justice, I’d have been caught by them now or may have even be killed by these bastards!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
