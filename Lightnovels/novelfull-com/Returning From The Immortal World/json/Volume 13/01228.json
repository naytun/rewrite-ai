He shook his head and said, “The Sus and Tangs have never had any feud. Your family isn’t yet worth to enter the list.”</p><p>Su Xiangdong angrily said, “If there’s no feud between us, then why did you…”</p><p>Raising his hand to interrupt Su Xiangdong, Tang Xiu coldly said, “The Sus and Tangs have no feuds whatsoever, but the same can’t be said between me and Su Xiaoguang, your grandson. He said everyone from House Tang has already died and the Tangs are no longer what we once were. That’s why I’ll make your family know that House Tang is still kicking.”</p><p>Only then did Su Xiangdong understand the reason why Tang Xu came with such a large force. He even had the Special Abilities Bureau involved because his grandson had offended him.</p><p><em>Still… is it really needed to form such a large force just because of a minor conflict between youngsters? Is it even necessary to set up the Su Family with treason?</em></p><p>Suddenly, he realized something and his pupils shrunk. “Tang Xiu, are you trying to warn others by punishing us?”</p><p>“No wonder the Su can thrive and gain a foothold in the capital for decades, huh.” Tang Xiu gave a thumbs up and praised. “It turns out that Patriarch Su really has wisdom and intellect. It’s really a pity when your offspring and grandson are a letdown and even invite a disaster to befall upon your family, isn’t it? But now, things have happened and come to this point, so it’s time for you to die!”</p><p>Duanmu Lin slowly raised his hand.</p><p>“WAIT!”</p><p>Su Xiangdong’s face looked miserable as he shouted, “I know your purpose, Tang Xiu, but I beg you to give my family a way to survive. I can give that unfilial bastard, Su Xiaoguang, to you to be punished if he offended you. Whether he’ll live or die, you can do whatever you want to him!”</p><p>Tang Xiu narrowed his eyes and watched Su Xiangdong, who now looked like he was turning several years older instantly. He then replied to him lightly, “You still have that chance if you do have the intention to settle everything peacefully. We can also talk about the chance of sparing everyone from your family. Only, the Special Abilities Bureau has recently been short of funds and we need to purchase various equipment…”</p><p>“My family is willing to pay for it. Please state the number,” said Su Xiangdong in a deep voice.</p><p>“10 billion.” Tang Xiu stretched out a finger and lightly said, “10 billion is the amount needed by the Special Abilities Bureau. Provide the money if you want everyone in your family to be spared.”</p><p><em>Gasp…</em></p><p>The Su Family may be rich, but Su Xiangdong still gasped after hearing the excessive amount of money demanded by Tang Xiu.</p><p>The Su Family was indeed able to raise 10 billion yuan, but once they withdrew such an amount, it would severely damage the foundation of the family, to the extent that it would be nearly impossible for them to recover in decades.</p><p><em>What should I do?</em></p><p>Su Xiangdong’s expression kept changing as all ideas intensely clashed inside his head. Finally, he spoke in a heavy tone, “No problem. My family will provide the said amount to fund the Special Abilities Bureau.”</p><p>“You’re really able to adapt to the circumstances, Patriarch Su. That’s great.” Tang Xiu praised as he gave him a thumbs up again. “So, let me tell you the second condition. Su Dingguo from your family is already old and he’s no longer suitable to hold any post in the government. He must leave his office and live as an average person from now on!”</p><p>“You…”</p><p>Su Xiangdong felt like he had just swallowed thousands of flies as his expression turned unsightly to the extreme. Even though his family had many members, they only had a few potential juniors in the younger generations. Su Dingguo was exactly their future hope for the family, the son he cherished and hoped to go farther and farther in the future, and the one who had the chance to become a governor.</p><p>In case he resigned, the Su Family could expect to face a much difficult path in the future, which would make it more even difficult for them to return to their current situation.</p><p>“I comply!”</p><p>Su Dingguo tightly clenched his fists, his nails deeply digging into his palms, causing blood to drip down between his fingers.</p><p>“All members of the Sus are also forbidden to come out for the next six months. You’re under house arrest and are not allowed to step out of your house,” Tang Xiu added lightly.</p><p>“I comply!”</p><p>Su Xiangdong’s voice was squeezed out of his throat.</p><p>Tang Xiu went on with a sneer, “My last demand is about Su Xiaoguang. His big mistake must be punished. I don’t want to see him able to even stand for the rest of his life.”</p><p><em>Puah…</em></p><p>This time, Su Xiangdong spurted out a mouthful of blood. If it wasn’t for Su Dingguo next to him, who quickly grabbed and held him up, he would have already fallen to the ground.</p><p>“I’ll break his legs with my own hands!”</p><p>Su Xiangdong’s face was as though devoid of life after he replied.</p><p>Tang Xiu happily nodded and said, “Then I’ll be waiting for you to deliver your promises. I don’t care how wild and arrogant the Su Family or the other families are. But today, I’ll make everyone in the country know that House Tang still exists!”</p><p>Having said that, he nodded to Duanmu Lin and cupped his fists. “Senior Duanmu, this issue has been resolved, so we’re going to give a way out for the Sus to keep on living. If this family still dares to make House Tang as an enemy again, the Special Abilities Bureau doesn’t need to get involved again, for House Tang will completely exterminate them at that time!”</p><p>“I don’t care much about the dispute between families and will stay away from it later,” said Duanmu Lin lightly. “But keep in mind to cover everything well so I don’t hear and see anything when you exterminate the Su Family, got it?”</p><p>“Don’t worry about that.” Tang Xiu smiled and said, “I was able to get rid of the Yaos before, a small family such as the Sus isn’t worth it to even enter my eyes.”</p><p>Duanmu Lin nodded in response before he glanced at Su Xiangdong with some pity. Then, he shouted an order in a deep voice, “Heed my orders, all members! Withdraw immediately.”</p><p>In just a minute, all the members of the Special Abilities Bureau withdrew from the Su Family’s residence. Duanmu Lin and Tang Xiu also didn’t stay and directly left by car.</p><p>In just two hours, the calamity that befell the Su Family spread out through various channels to all the affluent families in the capital and even reached the ears of some powerful families in other provinces of China.</p><p>“House Tang still exists and their members are still alive!”</p><p>The line spread out very fast and quickly passed to the ears of every powerful person in China. Even some powerful Big Bosses could only force a wry smile and shook their heads after receiving the news.</p><p>****</p><p>At the Monarch Club.</p><p>Bai Tao and Qin Shaoyang calmly sat before the table while waiting for Tang Xiu to arrive. Both of them wore similar expressions and were apparently thinking about something.</p><p><em>Ring, ring, ring…</em></p><p>Bai Tao’s cell phone rang and abruptly pulled both men from their train of thought.</p><p>Bai Tao grabbed his cell phone and looked at the number displayed on the screen first. After seeing that it was his father’s number, he immediately pressed the answer button and asked, “What happened, Dad?”</p><p>“Tao’er, have you been in touch with Tang Xiu recently?”</p><p>“Yeah, we just met today and now I’m waiting for him to have a drink at the Monarch Club.”</p><p>“Do remember to never alienate Tang Xiu no matter what House Tang becomes! Preserve a good relationship with him. It’s best if you can become a life-and-death sworn brother with him.”</p><p>“What’s wrong with you, Dad? Did something happen?”</p><p>“It’s a major incident…”</p><p>A few minutes later.</p><p>Bai Tao zoned out after he hung up the phone. After he put his cell phone on the table, he stared blankly at Qin Shaoyang, who was bewildered by his action. Bai Tao’s lips squirmed a few times and he said with a wry smile, “You know, the Su Family is finished. They can be ranked as the second-class family in Beijing as of recently, but they probably can’t even enter the list of the third-rate family in just a flash moment.”</p><p>Qin Shaoyang abruptly got up and quickly asked, “What exactly happened?”</p><p>“My old man just called and said that Tang Xiu and a large number of people from the Special Abilities Bureau directly stormed the Su Family and committed slaughter after charging them for treason. Finally, the Su Family’s Patriarch, Su Xiangdong, then begged for mercy…”</p><p>After hearing the full story from Bai Tao, disbelief was all over Qin Shaoyang’s face. He never thought that Tang Xiu would be so powerful that he could even move the personnel of the Special Abilities Bureau.</p><p>“In the past, I thought that he was relying heavily on the Tang Family, but now I realize that it turns out to be the other way around. I just can’t imagine how much power he possesses at the present.” Qin Shaoyang took a deep breath and grinned wryly.</p><p>“Well, the first time I met him was when he was still a nobody who was just about to showcase his talents to the world.” Bai Tao nodded and said, “It never crossed my mind that he would reach so high in just a few years. You know, if I must be honest, what I’m worried about is how I can still have some fun times with him in the future!”</p><p>Qin Shaoyang gave it a thought and said, “Bai Tao, back when I decided to be Tang Xiu’s good friend, I was really sincere, not only because of his identity but also due to his own abilities. I then found that he has a likable personality ever since I got acquainted with him and how he values friendship and relationship—the qualities that make him a rare friend to have. That’s why I’ve already thought it through. I’ll cast away any other thoughts and just become his good friend no matter how powerful he becomes in the future. I just care about him. I don’t care about anything else that entails with him being my friend.”</p><p>“Well said!”</p><p>Tang Xiu came floating and appeared in front of the two dazed men. His right hand lightly patted Qin Shaoyang’s shoulder and he smilingly said, “Treating a friend with sincerity and putting away any external factors entailed. That’s really how one must treat their true friends. Qin Shaoyang, you will be my true friend and a brother of mine.”</p><p>Qin Shaoyang got up and patted Tang Xiu’s shoulder as well, laughing. “Hahaha. I have many friends, but the true ones among them are but a few. From today on, you and Bai Tao are my real friends along with Chu Yi, though I have no idea where this fella has run to recently. But no matter what, all three of you are my friends. And Bai Tao, thanks a bunch for standing up for me today.”</p><p>“We’re friends, so save your thanks later on, got it?” replied Bai Tao with a smile.</p><p>Friends and brothers. These two terms somehow always aroused vigilance in Tang Xiu’s heart. He had always been wary of giving his back to those who even had the best relationship with him, like Yuan Chuling and Long Zhengyu.</p><p>But today, Qin Shaoyang said something that made him realize that some people wanting to be his friends out of their pure intention without any external factors, but only their sincerity to become friends with him.</p><p>Back when he was in the Immortal World, those who he once thought were life-and-death brothers had too much involvement and entanglement entailed. Their relationship gradually fell behind and turned into one that was more and more vested in interests and benefits, and no longer was there such a pure intention from the beginning.</p><p>“Come, let’s have a toast!”</p><p>Tang Xiu raised his glass and laughed loudly.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
