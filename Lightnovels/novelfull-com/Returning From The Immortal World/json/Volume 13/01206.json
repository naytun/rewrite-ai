It wasn’t only limited to those large companies that came to Star City to seek cooperation with the Magnificent Tang Corp., but it was also known to the average people.</p><p>Everyone was literally sitting still on the bench, waiting to watch this wonderful show of a century. Countless eyes were focused on the Imperial Dragon Manor where the Long Family resided, Long Group’s HQ, as well as the Long’s Dining Hall where the representatives of Harbo Group were currently staying at. Meanwhile, the HQ of the Magnificent Tang Corporation and Kang Xia’s residence were also not spared from the observation of these many eyes.</p><p>The news that Li Yuetao, the Deputy Mayor of Star City, and Jiang Fei, the Chief of City Public Security Bureau, and lastly William, the Director of China’s Harbo Group, went to the Imperial Dragon Manor together, quickly spread out in a short time, garnering the attention of these countless eyes to focus there, waiting for the outcome of this wonderful show.</p><p>“IT FAILED!”</p><p>When the three men left the Imperial Dragon Manor, all forces immediately turned into turmoil. No one believed that Long Hanwen turned out to be so arrogant to refuse to give a senior official some face. They didn’t expect that the man would be so headstrong and tough to pick a fight with the Harbo Group.</p><p>However, at this time, another news quickly spread out to the entire Star City that Tang Xiu, the owner of Magnificent Tang Corp., was said to have returned to Star City and it was rumored that he and the successor of the Long Group, Long Zhengyu, were very close friends.</p><p>At the Long’s Dining Hall.</p><p>The Director of China’s Harbo Group, William, just returned to the hotel and was about to call the company’s major shareholder, Cal Solund’s father, when heard the hasty knocks on his door.</p><p>“Come in!” said William in a deep voice.</p><p>A moment later, a black middle-aged man entered the room. He came to William and reported. “Sir William, we just received accurate news that the Big Boss of Magnificent Tang Corp. Tang Xiu has returned to Star City from overseas. Mr. Tang is rumored to have a very good friendship with Long Zhengyu of the Long Group and my conjecture is he should have come back for him.”</p><p>William’s expression turned extremely ugly instantly. He had received a note of refusal from the Magnificent Tang Corp. in regard to the partnership. It was very likely that that the Boss of this company was rushing back to stand in the same camp as Long Group.</p><p>Then again, how should he deal with this Cal Solund bastard?</p><p>Although he had literally ruined any chance of cooperation between the company and the Magnificent Tang Corp, there was also his involvement in inciting that bastard to do so. If he just immediately brought his team to leave China, it was very likely that his father would never let him go scot-free.</p><p>What should I do?</p><p>William, who previously wanted to call Cal Solund’s father, instantly hesitated for a while. He didn’t quickly reply to his subordinate’s report, but took out a cigarette and lit it up. While smoking, trains of thoughts filled his mind as he analyzed things in the hope of finding the perfect solution.</p><p>Ring, ring, ring…</p><p>Just as he was at a loss and unable to find any way out, the phone he put on the table suddenly rang. He quickly grabbed it and saw that it was an unfamiliar number and hesitated for a while whether to pick it up or not. But finally, he connected and asked, “William speaking here, may I know who is this?”</p><p>“I’m Tang Xiu from the Magnificent Tang Corporation.” A calm voice from the phone answered him.</p><p>William was dumbfounded and his heart was suddenly inundated with a bad feeling. Then, he hurriedly replied, “Hello, Mr. Tang. Your call surprised me since I didn’t expect it. Oh my God, this is truly a pleasure and honor for me.”</p><p>“Mr. William, I’ll get straight to the point here. The issue between the Harbo Group and the Long Group has come to my desk. I and Long Zhengyu are friends, but you also come here for my company, so I naturally can’t stand idly by and do nothing since it happened in Star City with you here as well,” said Tang Xiu. “If it’s convenient with you, I hope you can come to the Magnificent Tang Corp. immediately. Let’s meet and talk about this.”</p><p>“Okay. I’ll be right there.”</p><p>William hung up but with a confused face.</p><p>What exactly is going on?</p><p>Didn’t this Tang Xiu, the Big Boss of Magnificent Tang Corp. have created obstacles for me? Why did he call now and looks like he will help me, of all times?</p><p>At the HQ of the Magnificent Tang Corporation.</p><p>Four black Mercedes-Benz slowly stopped at the gate of the edifice and many people who came in and out of the building shifted their attention to them. Although such a motorcade was often seen coming in the last few days, each of them still garnered the attention of many people.</p><p>“Is there another situation?”</p><p>Many people who passed by had their mouth opened wide after seeing the next scene along with disbelief on their faces. It was because the goddess in their eyes, Kang Xia, the General Manager of the Magnificent Tang Corporation, quickly got out of the second Mercedes-Benz, before she quickly turned to the other side and personally opened the car’s door.</p><p>Who could be the bigwig that had such a reputation worthy to even make Kang Xia, the GM of Magnificent Tang Corporation, open the door for him or her?</p><p>However, when Tang Xiu’s figure was seen coming out of the car, the shock of these many people who already knew his identity vanished. Although Tang Xiu was like a dragon whose head and tail were always a mystery to the public and it was Kang Xia who handled the business affairs of the company, he was, after all, the owner of the Magnificent Tang Corporation. Which meant that he was the only person in this world who was qualified to make her open the car’s door.</p><p>20 minutes passed by and the news that Tang Xiu, the Boss of Magnificent Tang Corporation, entered the HQ building publicly was known to the many interested people. However, when everyone speculated what he would do after returning to his company publicly, another inexplicable scene added more confusion to the already incredible moods these people had. It was because William, the Director of China’s Harbo Group, actually came to visit the Magnificent Tang Corporation’s edifice in a hurry. Even the security guards at the gate didn’t stop his entry.</p><p>On the 18th floor of the edifice.</p><p>Tang Xiu calmly sat in the reception room while holding a cup of hot tea and looked at William, who sat at his opposite side, looking restless and agitated. Then, he slowly spoke, “I already know everything about what happened between you and the Long Group, Mr. William. I must be honest with you, it made me discontent. You came to China and Star City to strike a business deal with my company, yet you picked up a fight and clashed with some local tycoons here. What you did will bring out quite a serious blow to my company’s reputation.”</p><p>William forced a wry smile and said, “Isn’t that too serious a statement, Mr. Tang?”</p><p>“Why wouldn’t it?” Tang Xiu sneered. “Now everyone knows that your Harbo Group came for my company, yet you caused a scene here. Don’t tell me that the reputation of my company won’t suffer a blow from what you did. If the rest of the other companies were to act like Harbo Group and caused scenes in Star City, I’m sure the public and the average people in Star City will definitely curse us that we’ve attracted bandits here, no?”</p><p>“…”</p><p>William was speechless. Tang Xiu’s remarks were not pleasant to hear, but he clearly made sense in his reasonings. If the Heads of these major companies all over the world really made such scenes in Star City, it was expected that countless people would aim their curses at the Magnificent Tang Corporation immediately. The impact it brought toward the company’s reputation would indeed be quite a blow should it happen.</p><p>“You have nothing to say on this matter?” asked Tang Xiu lightly.</p><p>William spoke with a bitter voice, “Your reasoning made sense and I admit that we’re at fault on this matter. I personally ask forgiveness for what happened, Boss Tang. I’ll make sure that the Harbo Group will release a formal apology to the Magnificent Tang Corporation publicly, as well as to the Long Group. But if I may, could you help us free Cal Solund and take him back from the Long Group?”</p><p>“I suggest that you assign someone to hold a press conference to announce the formal apology first before we head over to the Long Group to take him back.” Tang Xiu nodded and said, “Only in this way can I help you meet the Big Boss of Long Group, Long Hanwen, to free your people.”</p><p>William was about to speak but then turned to his secretary next to him. “Draft a formal apology immediately and then hold a press conference to apologize to the Magnificent Tang Corporation and Long Group through the media.”</p><p>“Understood!”</p><p>As William’s secretary left, Tang Xiu immediately looked to have warmed up and was enthusiastic. However, even though William didn’t give up trying to pull the conversation to the cooperation topic, Tang Xiu kept avoiding the subject and didn’t answer any of his questions on this matter at all.</p><p>Two hours later, the Harbo Group’s press release regarding the apology ended, which made everyone concerned about the incident a bit muddleheaded. The apology to the Long Group was understandable since some of their people were at fault and responsible for severely injuring the successor of the Long Group, Long Zhengyu, but why did they apologize to the Magnificent Tang Corporation as well? Was it because they were coming to visit the company, so the apology was meant for the little reputation hit?</p><p>Immediately after, all the forces heard the news that the Boss of Magnificent Tang Corp., Tang Xiu, and the Director of China’s Harbo Group, William, just left the Magnificent Tang Corp.’s HQ by car together and headed to the Imperial Dragon Manor.</p><p>At the Imperial Dragon Manor.</p><p>Long Hanwen was reading the company’s document at home and was constantly answering phone calls. Some of them were calling to express their concern and prayers for his son, Long Zhengyu, whereas some were asking for favors and some others were just expressing their anger like him.</p><p>Shortly put, many people and many forces alike, each with their own agenda, were waiting for the next show to take place.</p><p>Knock, knock…</p><p>The door of his study room was knocked and his female secretary came in, reporting respectfully, “Boss, Mr. Tang and William of Harbo Group are visiting.”</p><p>Long Hanwen slowly got up. Just as he stepped out of the door of the manor’s living room, he saw Tang Xiu and William standing in the yard. He didn’t even spare a glance at the latter and headed straight towards Tang Xiu, greeting smilingly. “Why are you here, Tang Xiu? Don’t tell me that you’re now acting as a lobbyist for some people?”</p><p>“I’ll speak honestly since you’ve mentioned it, Uncle Long,” said Tang Xiu with a smile. “What the people from Harbo Group have done was wrong and I know they are at fault as well. But they’re coming for my company, after all, so I hope Uncle Long can give me face and free this Cal Solund guy!”</p><p>“Tang Xiu, you and Zhengyu are friends. He has been severely injured and hospitalized. Even now he’s still in a coma. Yet, why do you still help outsiders?!”</p><p>“Uncle Long, I myself was very reluctant to do this. I hate what they did, but my company can’t escape the fact that the incident is related to us. Have you not heard the news that my company has informed them and refused the cooperation already?” said Tang Xiu reluctantly.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
