The winter had come, but the corridor was as warm as in Spring and the Bonsais and potted plants around the corner still looked lush and grew well.</p><p>However, a faint bloody smell permeated the air in the corridor and brought with it a hidden killing atmosphere. To make it worst, some ghostly figures also had destroyed all the monitoring equipment in the corridor. The situation caused the four security guards of the Long’s Dining Hall to come to check as they appeared in the corner.</p><p>“Mindless vandalism…”</p><p>The four people finally reached this conclusion. But there was something else they couldn’t believe, however. There were six CCTVs in the corridor, four of which were installed at the center aside from the two others that were installed at the end of the corridor. Yet, none of it captured anyone’s figure or shadow before they were destroyed.</p><p>This was… unusual… as bizarre as it could get. No matter how abnormal it was, the scene when some people destroyed the camera should have been captured by the monitors at the center even if both cameras at the end of the corridor were destroyed at the same time. Even if 6 people destroyed all the six cameras here at the same time, there should have been some footage that captured what happened before they destroyed the cameras.</p><p>Just as the four security guards felt uneasiness and continued their inspection around, one of them suddenly found that the door of the suit #4018 was not locked and opened it.</p><p>“Dalong, head inside and check it.”</p><p>The sturdy middle-aged man gave an order to his companion beside him as his hand carefully opened the unlocked door.</p><p>Gasp…</p><p>When the man called Dalong entered the room, his pupils suddenly shrunk with disbelief. A bit of fear that inundated his eyes was evident with the reflection of the light. “Dead bodies… six… in total…”</p><p>The complexion of the other three men changed. They quickly rushed into the room and saw six dead bodies lying in a pool of blood in the large room. Two of which were bodies of black men, one Caucasian, and 3 others of Asian descent.</p><p>“Call the cops quickly!” Dalong shouted.</p><p>The sturdy middle-aged man hurriedly stopped everyone and said in a deep voice, “We can’t! Let’s notify Cap’ first. The homicide occurred in our hotel and we need him to deal with it.”</p><p>“The homicide happened in our hotel, Brother Wang!” interrupted Dalong quickly. “Why don’t we hurry up and report to the cops? Maybe they can investigate the killer quickly.”</p><p>“Hmph.” The burly middle-aged man coldly hummed. “The homicide happened in our hotel and it would make our hotel lose tremendous reputation should it be announced, got it? Do you understand what kind of event is happening at this time? The representatives of many major companies from various countries are visiting Star City now, while our Long’s Dining Hall is the most luxurious hotel in Star City. Do you have any idea how many of these foreign forces are staying here? Do you want to see this thing get bigger or something?”</p><p>Dalong was oblivious to such aftermath and finally said after hesitating for a while, “Then we all listen to you, Brother Wang.”</p><p>Quickly after, the security guards at the Long’s Dining Hall confirmed the identities of the six dead bodies—from the Dandelion and Harbo Group. Only one of the dead bodies which was slightly hidden in the innermost bed that was from Harbo, whereas the other five were from Dandelion.</p><p>The two head representatives of both parties were stunned when they received the notification from the security guards. But after just one and a half hours, the representative of Dandelion Group contacted Tang Xiu.</p><p>In the café near South Gate Town, Tang Xiu, who wore casual attire and a duckbill cap, calmly sat in the corner while savoring his coffee. Sitting across from him was the head representative of Dandelion Group who looked grim with looming killing intent in his eyes as his eyes fixedly focused on Tang Xiu.</p><p>“What exactly do you want to do, then?” After a long time, Tang Xiu asked the man slowly.</p><p>Jezek clenched his fists and said, “The Dandelion Group truly wishes to secure a cooperation deal with your company, Mr. Tang. But your company just released the rules that forbid us to act recklessly in China. That’s why I keep holding back my anger and dare not take revenge on Harbo Group. I do know the fact that you’re Long Zhengyu’s friend but since the Longs seem to be afraid to pick up a fight with Harbo, do you agree if we take their place to avenge Young Master Long?”</p><p>There was a strange look in Tang Xiu’s eyes. It never came to him that this Jezek guy was quite a smart man and could put forward such smart excuses.</p><p>As for his consent on this matter, he wholeheartedly approved it inwardly, but he feigned to be in deep thought, nonetheless. After staying silent for a long while, he shook his head and said, “Mr. Jezek, it stands to reason that I’m actually furious after seeing Long Zhengyu being badly injured by them. But you came to China and Star City due to my company, and it will make me feel bad if I cannot guarantee your safety here. But are you sure your men were killed by someone from Harbo Group?”</p><p>“I’m absolutely sure,” said Jezek in a deep voice, “I just sent someone to check the body and it was indeed the work of William’s men. They even went in a hurry and thus, left a body of one of their people.”</p><p>“There must be a motive for the murder. I myself don’t think that the Harbo Group would kill your people for no reason.” Tang Xiu said.</p><p>“My side has grudges with Harbo Group as both sides have been engaged in rivalries. That William bastard has literally been shut out from your approval, which barred his company to have any cooperation with your Magnificent Tang Corporation. I’m guessing that they must be worried that my Dandelion company will strike a deal with your company and thus, the chief reason they want to destroy this opportunity.”</p><p>Tang Xiu’s expression changed and he asked in a deep tone, “Are you sure about that?”</p><p>“I dare not say I’m 100% sure, but 9 out of 10 am very positive on this one,” Jezek affirmed.</p><p>“In actuality, I already sent some men to investigate the details of the Dandelion Group. Your company is quite powerful and reliable and a good candidate for the partnership.” Tang Xiu said, “I already had the intention to discuss with you about the cooperation, but I never thought that this unexpected situation to occur. William is truly a damned bastard. He even dares to destroy the chance of cooperation between us.”</p><p>After hearing this, an excited and surprised expression immediately painted Jezek’s face and he hurriedly asked, “So, do you agree with it, Mr. Tang?”</p><p>“You have my consent, but under one request.” Tang Xiu said, “If your Dandelion Group wants to continue the cooperation with my company, the operation you launch against William must be carried out in secret. Else, no matter how eager I am to cooperate with you, I’m afraid I can’t withstand public opinion and can only give it up.”</p><p>“Please rest your worries on this one, Mr. Tang.” Jezek spoke in a deep voice, “Everything will be done in the dark without any noise. I can even pull the Cupid Group to our side in order to deal with Harbo. No one from the Harbo Group will leave China alive this time!”</p><p>“If you can do it silently, you can shift the blame to the Long Group since they already have grudges with Harbo,” said Tang Xiu.</p><p>Jezek was surprised. “But you and the Long Group…”</p><p>“What I care about is my company’s partner. My company may have some cooperation with the Long Group in some fields, but they are nothing to speak of compared to the following cooperation we’re about to have.” Tang Xiu replied lightly.</p><p>Jezek got up and bent his body forward. After shaking hands with Tang Xiu, he excitedly spoke, “You truly are an outstanding businessman, Mr. Tang. I’ll convey your goodwill to my employer and also develop a thorough and rigorous plan to ensure that William and the Harbo Group’s people he brought here disappear silently from the earth.”</p><p>****</p><p>Early the next morning.</p><p>Tang Xiu was having breakfast at home when Kang Xia came in a hurry and placed a table in front of him and spoke in a low voice, “What should happen just took place, Boss.”</p><p>Tang Xiu narrowed his eyes and asked, “What about Tang An?”</p><p>“She’s outside,” Kang Xia replied.</p><p>Tang Xiu then recalled that he had arranged an array to cover the house. Even if Tang An was able to shuttle anywhere through the void, she was likely unable to easily enter the array he had arranged. Immediately after, he turned on the tablet and a curved arc outlined on the corner of his mouth after seeing the footage being played. “What about the Longs? How are they doing?”</p><p>“Everything went according to your plan.” Kang Xia replied, “Long Hanwen sent messengers to invite the head representatives of the Cupid and Sava Groups to the Imperial Dragon Manor to interrogate them in person on why they would send some people to attack his Long Family and kill many people there. The evidence is beyond dispute and impossible to argue. Simply put, they’re going crazy.”</p><p>“It would be very difficult to get rid of everyone from Harbo just relying on the Dandelion Group alone. But things will go smoothly if Dandelion, Cupid, and Sava join hands. I can tell that William may be able to escape at that time, but I’m sure it will be very difficult for him to flee from Star City.”</p><p>“True that.” Kang Xia nodded. “Also, William is now hiding in a residential building in Star City’s New Metro. That place is quite covert since it hasn’t been handed over to its owner. Further, he only has four men left as of now, but two of them have been injured.”</p><p>“Alright. Inform the Dandelion’s people to release the news that it was Harbo’s people who killed the Cupid and Sava Groups’ members and then left the bodies at the Long Family’s residence. The purpose was to incite hostilities between the two parties with the Long Group as an attempt to use both parties’ hands to deal with the Longs.”</p><p>Kang Xia’s eyes shone and she immediately left the room in strides.</p><p>****</p><p>Daytime…</p><p>In a certain building in the newly built area of the New Metro of Star City that hadn’t been handed over to its owner, William was sitting exhausted on the cold floor with a face full of bloodstains and eyes nursing aggrievance.</p><p>He messed up. Everything was messed up. He felt like there was a large invisible net that had already covered him and his men with a huge plot already set in motion against him.</p><p>“Where the hell is that bastard Cal Solund now?”</p><p>He took some heavy and deep breaths and looked at his stalwart subordinate seven-plus meters away from him.</p><p>The sturdy man answered, “He’s being treated at the Star City Chinese Medical Hospital due to his serious injuries. But we got the news that some people picked him up and his whereabouts are unknown now. He’s just… missing.”</p><p>“Who the hell did this?!”</p><p>The bad feeling inside William’s heart grew stronger.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
