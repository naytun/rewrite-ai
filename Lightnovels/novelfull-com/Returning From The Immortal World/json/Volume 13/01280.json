You shouldn’t have come here if you don’t have the capital. You should be from China too, right? I’ll give you face and one last chance since we’re both Chinese. I’ll halve the amount you owe me. You must pay me at least 2.4 billion dollars, else you won’t leave here alive.”</p><p>Du Chengfeng almost cried. Where would he get 2.4 billion dollars? Even if he were to sell himself and everything he had, the amount wouldn’t be worth so much either!</p><p>“You still can’t take it? If so, I’m afraid you’ll have your death anniversary next year in the next few days,” Tang Ahlang said with a smile.</p><p>Du Chengfeng was anxious and blurted out, “I still have a solution left.”</p><p>“You do?” The smiling arc on the corner of Tang Ahlang’s mouth went higher as he said, “Then I’m giving you half an hour to transfer the money to my account.”</p><p><em>BAM…</em></p><p>The VIP lounge’s door was pushed by someone from the outside. Tang Guang, dressed in white and smiling, walked from the outside and saw the scene inside. He shook his head with a smile and said, “Little Martial Uncle, the fight at the other places will be over if you keep playing like this.”</p><p>Tang Ahlang slightly smiled and replied, “Just gimme half an hour.”</p><p>Tang Guang pulled a chair and kicked the black man’s body aside. He then shifted to Du Chengfeng and asked with a smile, “What’s up with this fella, though?”</p><p>“He owes me some money and I’m waiting for him to collect the amount. By the way, you still have 29 minutes left.” Tang Ahlang chuckled.</p><p>Du Chengfeng shuddered and his lips squirmed a few times. He finally pulled out his mobile phone with a panicked look. After a few seconds of thinking, he dialed a cell number. After his call was picked up by the other party, he said, “Ah Hang, please save me. I need money. 2.4… no, no, no, just 2.1 billion dollars. I’m gonna die if I don’t have enough money.”</p><p>“Did you just gamble again?” a cold voice replied from the phone.</p><p>“I was just… going to play casually. I never thought that I’d lose this badly all of a sudden,” Du Chengfeng bitterly said with a distressed face. “I’m your little uncle and the uncle of your brother-in-law. Please save me. I’ll listen to you in the future as long as you save me.”</p><p>“I don’t have enough money,” the voice sounded stiff when it replied from the phone again.</p><p>Du Chengfeng’s face changed greatly and he shouted, “Ah Hang, your father Han Jintong has ruthlessly turned his back on me after the fallout, you can’t be as ruthless as him! Just save me and I’ll listen to all of your orders in the future. I’ll even apologize to your father if you want me to do so.”</p><p>“How much time do you have left?” the indifferent voice from the phone replied again.</p><p>Du Chengfeng looked happy and hurriedly said, “Half an hour… No, I only got 28 minutes left. The man said that he’ll kill me if he doesn’t see 2.4 billion dollars in his account within 28 minutes. Ah Hang, the other two men and their bodyguards have been killed, so please hurry up!”</p><p>“Got it.”</p><p>Tang Guang, who was sitting a few meters away, looked at Du Chengfeng as the man put away his phone. He frowned and then asked in a deep voice, “I overheard you talking with someone and you mentioned someone named Han Jintong, yes? What is he to you?”</p><p>“He’s my big brother’s uncle,” Du Chengfeng said. “Why? Do you know him?”</p><p>“Then who’s the person you just called?” Tang Guang asked again.</p><p>“He’s Han Jintong’s son—my nephew, Han Hang,” Du Chengfeng said.</p><p>Tang Guang took a deep breath and asked in a deep voice again, “Answer my last question, what’s the name of Han Jintong’s granddaughter?”</p><p>“Han Qingwu,” Du Chengfeng answered without thinking.</p><p>Tang Guang’s complexion changed. He shifted to Tang Ahlang and said, “Martial Uncle, let him go!”</p><p>Tang Ahlang creased his brows and a thoughtful look flashed on his face. He nodded and slowly said, “Du Chengfeng, I’ll forgive you this time on the account of my Martial Nephew. Get the hell out of this place at once!”</p><p>Little did Du Chengfeng think that this handsome young man who had just entered and asked him a few questions would make such a request and agree to let him go without anything attached.</p><p>Do they really waive his debt of 2.4 billion dollars?</p><p>Suddenly, his expression slightly changed and hurriedly asked, “Who are you? Do you know… that Qingwu girl?”</p><p>“Shut up!” Tang Guang’s face turned cold and he shouted in a deep voice, “Get the hell out this once, else I won’t mind killing you here and now!”</p><p>“Yes, yes. I’m leaving. I’ll be gone at once!” Du Chengfeng was startled and hurriedly run with his two bodyguards.</p><p>Tang Ahlang glanced at the casino staff and gave them a hand signal. After they left, he curiously asked, “Who’s this Han Qingwu, Tang Guang? Is she really worth 2.4 billion dollars?”</p><p>“Sigh, you’d better not mention her name in front of Grand Master, Martial Uncle.” Tang Guang sighed and wryly smiled. “That woman… She’s a demon barrier in Grand Master’s heart.”</p><p>Tang Ahlang was surprised. He knew that Tang Xiu, his Master, had many women already, but he never heard of this Han Qingwu.</p><p><em>A demon barrier? What kind of woman is she? How could she become a demon barrier in Master’s heart?</em></p><p>What had transpired piqued a strong curiosity in him. He waved to motion the dozen carefully selected guards in the room to leave. After only the two of them were left in the room, he said, “What’s going on, Tang Guang? Just tell me so I can also know what to do if I run into this woman in the future.”</p><p>Tang Guang forced a smile and said, “Properly speaking, this matter is not something I can tell you since Grand Master will definitely punish me if he finds out. But you do have a point, however. I’ll tell you what I know about this, but you must remember not to tell anyone else later.”</p><p>“Sure.” Tang Ahlang nodded.</p><p>Tang Guang forced a smile again and went on, “I don’t know about the specific details on this matter, either. But one thing I know is that Han Qingwu was Grand Master’s teacher in high school—his class’s teacher in charge, specifically. Later on, Grand Master was admitted to Shanghai University and Han Qingwu also followed him there. Originally, we all thought that she would become the Grand Master’s woman. But after some time… she kind of became a taboo for him. Shortly put, you must remember to retreat whenever you run into this woman. You must treat any news you hear about her as if you never heard of them.”</p><p>“This…” Tang Alang hesitated before he nodded without a word.</p><p>“Alright, let’s set off! We gotta see the situation next door,” Tang Guang said.</p><p>In the next door.</p><p>The 1,000-plus square-meters hall was fully filled with LCD monitors everywhere. Every monitor showed strange places, and many practitioners were seen on the footage. Some of them were members of the Pyramid, some from the League of Archcrusaders, Stygian Club, but most of them were members of the four major military corps.</p><p>“Commander, the Dragon Army and the Tiger Army have pulled out the secret branches of these three organizations, whereas their core executives have been forced back to their strongholds and keep resisting. Additionally, the Phoenix Army engaged with House Dolan and all experts of this House were killed in the fight.</p><p>“It will only take at most 2 hours before we can fully exterminate the remnant force of the Pyramid, League of Archcrusaders, and Stygian Club.</p><p>“Aside from that, His Majesty has ordered us to investigate the Darkwind and we’ve found their den. However, we have yet to fully dig out the list of their intel operatives in various countries. The Intelligence Department just sent a message that they will need a few days more.</p><p>“The casualties on our side are minimal according to the previous battle situation. The Dragon Army lost a total of six people, 9 people from Tiger Army, whereas the Phoenix Army reported zero casualties.</p><p>“All in all, your battle plan has been implemented perfectly, Commander-in-chief. Do you have any orders for our next moves?”</p><p>The place was a temporary military headquarter of the Great Tang Empire’s campaign, and the people who just reported to Tang Ahlang were the people he could train in recent years.</p><p>Tang Ahlang slowly shook his head and said, “Keep our advance according to the plan. Immediately start the next plan and get the reserve force to execute it should there be any emergency in any place. By the way, have the soldiers proficient in the Memory Erasing Technique undertaken their duties?”</p><p>“They have taken actions and erased the memories of ordinary people who witnessed the battles. This matter won’t be a problem for us.”</p><p>“Good!”</p><p>Tang Ahlang nodded and fell into silence. Although he didn’t personally visit the battlefield to direct the battles, he was still updated about the situation on the battlefield through this monitoring system. He could even launch the final strike at the same time and still achieve great results just by issuing the order.</p><p>Suddenly, Tang Guang asked, “Where’s Grand Master now?”</p><p>“He should be in Salzburg,” Tang Alang answered after thinking for a moment.</p><p>“Is there a lineage of the Stygian Club there?” Tang Guang frowned and asked.</p><p>“Yeah.” Tang Ahlang nodded. “Master said he also wants to see his old acquaintances in Salzburg to help guard China as well as some relatives left by members of the Great Tang Empire.”</p><p>Tang Guang nodded and smilingly said, “Grand Master is seriously putting heavy importance on relationship and righteousness, isn’t he? He asked Duanmu Lin to promise him on this matter before, but now he went to the Salzburg Bloodkin lineage, indicating that he wants double insurance!”</p><p>“What do you think? Will Master bring those vampires to the Immortal World as well?” Tang Ahlang asked.</p><p>“I don’t think so,” Tang Guang said. “We’re going to face his life-and-death archenemies in the Immortal World. He would never rashly take anyone he has no absolute trust in. Otherwise, should those vampires be compromised, they will expose the existence of our Great Tang Empire and bring danger to all of us.”</p><p>“Yeah!” Tang Ahlang nodded in response.</p><p>After 3 hours, the top three forces in the world were all massacred by the three corps of the Imperial Army of the Great Tang Empire, where 99% of their cultivators, ability users, mutants, and divergent races were all killed.</p><p>Immediately after, Tang Ahlang issued the last order. “Go all out to investigate the Darkwind’s intel network in every country around the world, and then dig out their intel operatives in each country.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
