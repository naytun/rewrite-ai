Thanks to your medicine, pills and the cultivation art you taught me, I believe I can definitely live to the moment my Mom closes her eyes.”</p><p>“You have made up your mind, so I will no longer speak about this,” said Tang Xiu. “But for thanking me, you just said it and it’s all fine with me.”</p><p>“Wait!”</p><p>Her voice was a bit urgent and anxious as she went on, “Where are you now, Divine Doctor Tang? I… I want to see you.”</p><p>Tang Xiu frowned and asked, “Is there something else you need?”</p><p>“There’s an issue—quite important,” replied Li Cai.</p><p>Tang Xiu pondered for a moment and slowly said, “I’m afraid you’ll have to wait for quite a while. There’s something I need to handle in Star City, so I’m now on the way there. If it’s really urgent, you can come to Star City yourself. If you’re not in a hurry, wait until I’m done tending the business in Star City and return to Shanghai. That’s right, aren’t you and your mother still staying in Shanghai?”</p><p>“Yeah. We’re still here along with Brother Shaokun,” said Li Cai. “Alright, I’ll immediately head over to Star City, Divine Doctor Tang. We’ll speak more after we meet there.”</p><p>“No need to rush. I think it would be tomorrow afternoon when I arrive in Star City,” said Tang Xiu.</p><p>“Then I’ll just wait for you there.”</p><p>After the call ended, a subtle light glittered in Tang Xiu’s eyes. Through the short exchange just now, he realized that Li Cai gave him a good impression and he liked this girl. It wasn’t a sentiment from a man to a woman, but rather an admiration towards her. She could lay off her life and sacrifice herself for her mother—a price too big to pay, yet she still chose it. He didn’t dare say that there was no one left in today’s society who could do the same, but the number was few and far between nowadays.</p><p>“We got annoying troubles approaching, Grand Master.”</p><p>Tang An’s voice suddenly passed into his ear.</p><p>Tang Xiu furrowed his brows, turning his head and glancing around as he saw tens of burly men approaching from the cabin, one of whom was an ugly and ferocious-looking big man who grabbed the clothes of a thin man and nearly dragged him over.</p><p>“All of you, listen to me! The safety fee is 20 yuan for each person. Don’t blame these brothers for not paying!” The big man threw the thin man on the deck and trampled on him when he spoke.</p><p>Tang Xiu slightly furrowed his brows and suddenly heard two men in leather attire about seven-plus meters away speak:</p><p>“It’s these assholes again. They’re too blatant in extorting everyone just because they got the support from the Ouyang Family for this bullshit security fee for their protection service here.”</p><p>“We got no other choice, mate! Who doesn’t know the background of the Ouyangs in Jingmen Island? Nearly all the visitors coming crossing the sea by boat have been extorted by them. Many of them tried to call the cops, but do you know how they ended up? Those cops just turned a deaf ear knowing that these bastards are the Ouyangs’ goons.”</p><p>“Just be patient. We got no choice. Fortunately, the money they asked is just trivial. Count it as buying them two packs of cigarettes.”</p><p>“Alas, no other choice, huh.”</p><p>Tang Xiu’s brows slightly wrinkled after hearing the conversation of the duo. He then took out a cell phone from his pocket and dialed Ouyang Lulu’s number. After some time, the mumbling, sleepy voice of Ouyang Lulu came from the phone, “Ugh, who is this disturbing my dreams late at night…”</p><p>Tang Xiu couldn’t help but chuckle and said, “It’s me, Lulu.”</p><p>The instant after, she cried out with a happily surprised voice, “Are you coming back to Shanghai, honey? Where are you now? I’ll get up and come for you right away!”</p><p>“I’m not in Shanghai at the moment. I just arrived at the port of Jingmen Island and am about to return to Star City. There’s some business I need to tend to first over there. Well, I called you because there’s something I need to ask,” said Tang Xiu with a smile.</p><p>“What is it?” Ouyang Lulu sounded a bit disappointed but she still inquired.</p><p>“I took a liner to Guangyang from Jingmen Island and there’s this bunch of men extorting money from the passengers, shouting that it’s a protection fee. But the thing is, they are using your family’s name to justify it. Do you happen to know about this matter?”</p><p>“Got no idea about that, honest!” Ouyang Lulu sounded puzzled. “I often took a liner to Guangyang Province before but never bumped into anyone extorting money on the ship, though.”</p><p>“Care to make some calls to ask about it?” said Tang Xiu. “These people got some bad attitude and I think the wealthy Ouyang Family shouldn’t be bothered to care about such money, right?”</p><p>“I’m gonna call Big Brother right away to ask about this matter, Dear.” Ouyang Lulu quickly replied, “If the one responsible is from the Ouyang Family, I’ll definitely give <em>them</em> a hard lesson. If not, Big Brother will definitely be mad since these guys are just using the Ouyang’s name to run amuck.”</p><p><em>Referring to the Ouyang Family as…</em> them <em>?</em></p><p>“Wait, Lulu. Aren’t you a member of the Ouyangs?” asked Tang Xiu with a strange tone.</p><p>Ouyang Lulu was silent for a moment. Then, a lit gunpowder barrel-like shout came, “Tang Xiu bastard! You’re a jerk! Let me tell you. I’m not a member of the Ouyangs, not before and not now! I’m a member of the Tangs and your wife! Even if you’re a monkey, I’ll still follow you all over the mountain since I’m married to you. YOU GOT THAT?!!”</p><p><em>Cough, cough…</em></p><p>Tang Xiu dryly smiled and replied, “Okay, okay, chill down. You’re a member of the Tangs. Are we good now?”</p><p>“Hmph…”</p><p>Ouyang Lulu snorted and hung up. But a few minutes later, she called back and Tang Xiu picked up her call as he heard her saying, “I’ve asked about it clearly, Dear. Brother knows about the security fee collection on the liner. One of his men is doing it since he once saved my brother. That’s why he never scrutinizes it and just turns a blind eye even though he knows about it.”</p><p>“Tell your brother to point out another means for his benefactor and just don’t let this bunch of ruffians and hooligans make such spectacles on the liner in the future,” said Tang Xiu. “They Ouyangs are a wealthy big family and many eyes are staring at you, waiting for a chance to deal with you. In case someone else makes a case over this matter, no matter how insignificant it may be for the wealthy and powerful Ouyangs, it will still be a bit troublesome for you, regardless.”</p><p>“I understand,” said Ouyang Lulu with a nod.</p><p>After Tang Xu hung up, the ten or so burly men had come to him and their leader stretched his hand and spoke with a cold face, “Hand over the fee!”</p><p>Tang Xiu took out 20 yuan from his pocket and gave it to him, saying, “Today will be the last time for you to collect money here. I’m giving you the money as a sign that this the last time you do this. Keep in mind to distance yourselves from doing illegal things later, else even the Ouyangs won’t be able to save your asses.”</p><p>The man was stunned and instantly frowned. He sized up Tang Xiu and asked, “Who are you? You dare spit out such bullshit?”</p><p>“Bullshit? I don’t speak bullshit.” Tang Xiu shook his head. “Your Boss did save Ouyang Lei’s life, so you can use the Ouyangs’ name to commit outrages. Have you ever thought what you are doing will discredit the Ouyangs themselves?”</p><p>“Shit, who the f**k are you? You already know that the Ouyangs are powerful, who can convict us even if we commit crimes, huh? Who can take on the Ouyangs? WHO?!” A burly man behind the man suddenly rose the steel pipe in his hand.</p><p><em>PA…</em></p><p>A loud slap was heard and the big man was immediately sent flying. Since he was standing at the edge of the deck, the slap directly sent him plunging into the sea.</p><p>The leader and the tens of other big men were dumbfounded. They did hear that distinct loud slap, but they also witnessed that this young man before them just stood still. He didn’t even move his fingers!</p><p>Who just did the slap, then?</p><p>It wouldn’t be a ghost coming out late at night… right?</p><p>Tang Xiu’s expression was unperturbed and he lightly spoke. “People said that those who commit bad deeds will face doom one day. The society is like a melting pot with people from all walks of life blending into it. Some are of the upper class and smart enough to make money with their brains and abilities, whereas some others are just off the track, becoming bullies and acting rampant just because they have powerful backing. Such people may end up fine if they are only the average people, but they can expect big troubles if they bump into some influential people. What I said… is right, isn’t it?”</p><p>The leader ordered some of the men to run to the bridge to stop the ship for the rescue. The man himself didn’t leave and observed Tang Xiu’s calm expression. He tightly squeezed the money in his hand and asked again, “Who exactly are you? Are you really not afraid of the Ouyangs?”</p><p>“I may be a bit worried if it was another family. But I’m not afraid of the Ouyangs since I have the backing from one of them,” said Tang Xiu smilingly.</p><p>“Who is your backer in the Ouyang House?” the man frowned and asked.</p><p>Tang Xiu seemed to ponder for a moment and, while pointing at his nose, he answered, “My woman, Ouyang Lulu.”</p><p>“Ouyang Lulu? She’s your woman?”</p><p>The man stared blankly before his expression enormously changed. His body suddenly trembled and paced back several steps, looking surprised and alarmed as he cried out, “You are… are you, Boss Tang?”</p><p>Tang Xiu raised his hand to stroke his face with a strange smile. “Ah, how fast time flies and changes things. It feels like eons since nobody knows me before I appeared in the public. Honestly speaking, being famous is really tiresome as only staying low-profile can give me some relaxed time.”</p><p><em>BAM…</em></p><p>The man directly knelt in front of Tang Xiu and knocked his head thrice with a face uglier than crying, shudderingly saying, “B-Boss… Tang, we brothers have eyes but failed to see an important person like you and even dared to demand money from you. Please forgive us with your magnanimity on the account of your in-law’s face! I promise I’ll never extort protection money ever again later.”</p><p><em>Ring, ring, ring…</em></p><p>Just as his voice faded away, the ringtone of his mobile phone rapidly rang.</p><p>The man looked up at Tang Xiu.</p><p>“Hurry up and answer the call.” Tang Xiu nodded.</p><p>The man was as though receiving a pardon as he got up from the deck’s floor. After taking out his cell phone and seeing the screen, it turned out to be a call from his Boss. He immediately pressed the answer button and spoke carefully, “Are you looking for me, Boss? I’m on the liner now, but I’ll be back right away after we’ve arrived in Guangyang.</p><p>“You’re on the liner already?” a man’s voice came from the phone.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
