If my guess is correct, this laser gun’s firing range should be at least 2 kilometers, and it can blast a 100-ton boulder directly.”</p><p>The plot of the green expanse of grass hundreds of meters away suddenly lifted up and two green unusual cars came out. After speeding over, they stopped in front of everyone, and Zhu Long strode to the front of Tang Xiu with a happy, surprised face, calling out, “You are here, Mr. Tang!”</p><p>“Well, I just arrived,” Tang Xiu smilingly replied.</p><p>“Chief Duanmu will definitely be happy if he knows you are here,” said Zhu Long excitedly.</p><p>The young man who shot him looked doubtful. He secretly thought of the name of a certain man upon hearing Zhu Long’s address. But recalling it sent a chill down his spine as he was sure that he would meet some bad luck if his guess was correct. It was because this certain person was known by all members of the Special Abilities Bureau—a god-like existence who was the main contributor for this site establishment.</p><p><em>He’s… Tang Xiu?!</em></p><p>At this moment, Tang Xiu himself also noticed the grim look on the young man’s face and worry in his eyes. He paced several steps forward and gently patted the young man’s shoulders, smilingly saying, “Don’t look worried. You can’t be blamed since you don’t know me.”</p><p>Zhu Long was stunned and bewildered. “Ehh? What happened?”</p><p>The young man wore an expression that was uglier than crying and replied, “About this… Mr. Tang asked me to shoot at him, saying that he wanted to try the power of the laser gun we’ve developed. Hence, I ended up shooting him, but it didn’t even leave a scratch on Mr. Tang’s clothes at all.”</p><p>Zhu Long immediately looked furious and cursed. “Bastard! Are you that stupid and just shot Mr. Tang just because he asked you to do so? Do you know who he is? He’s the very god-like man you boys must worship and admire! How dare you shoot at him? Are you tired of living already?”</p><p>Only then did the young man instantly understand that this handsome and audacious young man was exactly the famous Tang Xiu. At this moment, he nearly burst into tears and stutteringly said with wriggling lips, “M-Mr. Tang, I-I’m really sorry. I didn’t know who you were. Please forgive me. I… I’m just a newcomer here, and my special ability has just awakened for more than a year, and it’s only been over a year since I came here.”</p><p>“I just said that you’re not to blame since you didn’t know me, didn’t I?” Tang Xiu said with a smile. “Alright, go back to your duty! Zhu Long, take me to see Senior Duanmu.”</p><p>“Understood!”</p><p>Glaring fiercely at the young man, Zhu Long then immediately led Tang Xiu and Tang Ahlang to board the strange car and headed to the exit tunnel. The strange vehicle had a spacious interior and Tang Xiu was slightly surprised after observing it for a while due to its extremely fast speed. After entering the passage, the vehicle sped up at a speed of 450 km/h and took less than half a minute before it stopped in front of a large, empty hall made of metal.</p><p>After Tang Xiu and Tang Ahlang got off the vehicle, they saw 18 strong men in camouflage suits and armed with laser guns standing around the round hall. Each of them wore extremely stern expressions.</p><p>“Mr. Tang!”</p><p>These 18 strong men obviously knew who Tang Xiu was, and a fanatical look appeared filled their eyes the moment they saw him.</p><p>Tang Xiu faintly smiled in response. As he flicked his fingers, 18 pills suddenly shot into their hands and he smilingly said, “It’s been a long time and you all have become more powerful, guys! I hope these 18 pills can make you go further.”</p><p>“Thank you, Mr. Tang!” The 18 people were excited and simultaneously saluted.</p><p>A look of envy was cast on Zhu Long’s face. But he was well aware of Tang Xiu’s generosity. He recalled that he also obtained a lot of medicinal pills from Tang Xiu the last time he came here. Each expert of the Special Abilities Bureau that obtained such pills from Tang Xiu had progressed by leaps and bounds and their strengths greatly improved.</p><p>Tang Xiu was keenly aware of Zhu Long’s expression. He threw a jade bottle to him and said with a smile, “Well, I’m afraid Duanmu Lin won’t stay in the position of the Special Abilities Bureau’s Director soon. I’m giving you a bottle of pills hoping you can take over his duty in the future later.”</p><p>“What do you mean?”</p><p>The excited smile on Zhu Long’s face suddenly froze.</p><p>Tang Xiu only let out a light smile in response but didn’t explain anything. After hinting to the man to lead the way, a roughly 10 meters wide and four meters high door slowly opened on the wall of the circular round hall.</p><p>“Oh, God!”</p><p>Despite having a very steady disposition, Tang Ahlang, who followed Tang Xiu inside, couldn’t help exclaiming, and his breathing turned fast.</p><p>“Hey, don’t show off your inexperience and make me look bad.” Tang Xiu glanced at him and whispered.</p><p>Tang Ahlang accepted the instruction, but the shock on his face was not reduced in the slightest as he hurriedly replied, “What exactly is this place, Master? How do I… how do I feel like I just entered a high-tech world of an advanced civilization? It’s like I’m seeing a scene from foreign sci-fi movies. Everything here gives me a huge shock.”</p><p>While walking inside, Tang Xiu explained, “You’re right. This place is indeed a world of advanced civilization, and the tech you’re seeing here is at least ten times or even a hundred times more advanced than the technology you can find on Earth today. Maybe it will take centuries of development for technology on Earth to reach the level of technology you see here!”</p><p>“Let alone centuries, it’s very likely that it would take millenniums for the Earth’s science and technology to develop before it can reach this level of technology. It’s because there are some special materials here that can’t be found on Earth. If it wasn’t for the energy converter which can convert the materials, it would be impossible to develop more advanced machinery and objects such as we can see here.”</p><p>Tang Xiu let out an indifferent smile in response. He didn’t continue stepping on the stairway leading to the space in front but directly floated up and walked in the air forward step by step.</p><p>The place itself was a very large underground space. As far as the area was concerned, Tang Xiu’s eyes couldn’t see the end of the area at all. There were countless strange-shaped machines in the interior, and many armed soldiers in field uniforms were seen riding Aerogliders everywhere, while various other vehicles remained on the ground but flew according to a special flying path.</p><p>Further, there were also a large number of high-tech weapons here. Tang Ahlang even saw that more than a dozen fighter jets were parked in one corner of this space, while hundreds of personnel in blue overalls were busy around the fighter jets. But what shocked him was that these aircraft were not the kind of fighters he had seen in the outside world. He had read many military magazines prior to this and learned about many advanced fighters in the world.</p><p>Still, even the smallest aircraft from the dozens of aircraft here was over 200 meters long and its wings were scarily big. Tang Ahlang silently estimated that these aircraft definitely could accommodate more than 1,000 people.</p><p><em>This must be an alien aircraft!</em></p><p>Tang Ahlang whispered inwardly and secretly suppressed his shock.</p><p>“Hahaha…”</p><p>Loud and clear laughter suddenly came from the distance as Duanmu Lin flew directly to Tang Xiu. He stepped forward and gave Tang Xiu a big hug as he smilingly said, “You finally come out from that isolated island, Boy. What do you think about this place after looking around? This place has changed so much after a few years of development, yes?”</p><p>“It’s really different from before, indeed.” Tang Xiu smilingly replied, “It shows that you’ve done a great job here. By the way, I got one thing to ask. Can this base build interstellar battleships within 2 years? At least the Tier 3 interstellar spaceship?”</p><p>The smile on Duanmu Lin’s face receded and he replied with a loss expression, “What do you think? Even if all the personnel keep working overtime in research, experiment, and manufacturing, it’s just impossible to get it done in 2 years. Do you think researching and developing interstellar battleships is like handling a cabbage we can easily grow?”</p><p>A smile sketched on the corner of Tang Xiu’s mouth as he replied, “Well, since it’s not feasible, I’m afraid you won’t be able to see the results of our research here, neither will you be able to see the future development of science and tech on Earth in the future. To be honest, I’ve been wanting to ride such an interstellar battleship to stroll around the Milky Way.”</p><p>“Two years?” Duanmu Lin’s heart pounded and he shot a deep stare at Tang Xiu, asking, “You already made a decision? It’s going to be two years later?”</p><p>“Everything is ready and only needs to wait for the right time.” Tang Xiu nodded. “That’s why it can’t wait more than 2 years before leaving.”</p><p>Duanmu Lin forced a smile and said, “Can we stretch the time a bit? Five years. We can manufacture interstellar battleships in at least another five years. At that time, I also want to ride this aircraft and take a stroll around the galaxy.”</p><p>“We don’t have that leisure.” Tang Xiu shook his head and said, “Unless…”</p><p>Duanmu Lin’s expression shifted and he hurriedly asked, “Unless what?”</p><p>“I’m going to make a big move in the near future, so if the world’s top scientists and researchers were to be brought here, do you think you can produce an interstellar battleship within 2 years?”</p><p>Duanmu Lin thought for a while and then shook his head. “I’m not sure, honestly. However, it may be promising if we give it a try, regardless.”</p><p>Tang Xiu nodded and said, “If so, you wait here to receive a constant influx of scientists and technical personnel. Give me a communicator. I’m going to make two calls.”</p><p>Duanmu Lin immediately took out the communicator and handed it to Tang Xiu. “You can use this freely. This communicator can connect to various communication equipment in the world and can’t be traced by any satellite of any country.”</p><p>Tang Xiu nodded and dialed a set of numbers. After his call was picked up, he said, “Jin Shi, mobilize our intel department from today on and focus on investigating two targets. The first one being the world’s top three forces as well as House Dolan and the Darkwind. The second one is, you are to investigate technological scientists and researchers in various fields around the world—the best ones there are in each country. Give me the list after you’re done investigating them.”</p><p>“Does your Majesty have a certain number in mind already?” Jin Shi’s voice asked from the phone.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
