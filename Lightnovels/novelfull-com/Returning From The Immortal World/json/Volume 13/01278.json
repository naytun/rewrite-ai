He let out a faint smile and said, “You’re nothing but a bunch of rats scheming and tricking in the dark. How could rats like you have the balls to fight a dragon? Do you think you can really set off the storm to a vast and big country such as China?”</p><p>He paused for a moment before seemingly recalling something else. Then, the smile on his face turned thicker as his body slightly floated upward and reached the same height as the three men. “If the information I got is true, the Master behind you, the Ximen Wandai clan was originally from China too, right? Heh, they lost their foothold and could no longer stay in China in the past, so they acted like distressed rats and fled to this small country. Me killing you will serve as making a contribution to my fellow countrymen, no?”</p><p>The burly man’s expression drastically changed and disbelief filled his eyes. It must be noted that this matter was absolutely confidential, not even ordinary clansmen of Ximen Wandai were aware of. Only a dozen or so core members of the clan knew about this secret.</p><p>And yet, how come this kid knew about it? Who had betrayed the Ximen Wandai Clan and exposed this secret?</p><p>“KILL HIM!” The burly man took a deep breath and fiercely shouted.</p><p>An endless stream of hidden weapons and bullets were shot at Tang Ahlang, who stood tens of meters high in the air. Tang Ahlang’s position at this time made him a living target with no cover and obstruction. However, a surge of his True Essence energy blasted out as water droplets appeared out of thin air and began to spread violently, eventually forming a wall of water in front of him.</p><p>“Heh, ants.”</p><p>Tang Ahlang coldly hummed. He recalled the combat skill he had deduced previously. He recalled the scene of his fights against the fierce beasts in the pocket world and then waved his hands. Arrows made of water then formed in the wall of water and instantly blasted out down to the hundreds of people below.</p><p>The scene resembled a blasting gale steamrolling a wheat field.</p><p>Hundreds of assassins in training were pierced by arrows of water, reaping their lives. The tens of cultivator instructors didn’t have a chance to rescue any of them and could only watch as the elites they had trained from several years were all killed, nearly driving all of them into madness.</p><p>“KILL HIM!!!”</p><p>With overwhelming ferociousness, the tens of instructors took out their weapons and stormed over Tang Ahlang.</p><p>When Tang Ahlang came to this place, he began to analyze and deduce what kind of method he must use in the fight here, and finally came up with how he should kill the enemies after the short conversation. Therefore, he was very calm at this moment as his pupils began to contract slightly, observing the moving trajectories of these practitioners, calculating their speed and the distance between them, as well as the spots they would appear next.</p><p>“Sword Art—Divide!”</p><p>Waving his hand in a flash, Tang Ahlang manipulated the immortal sword and created dozens of sword beams that moved in bizarre trajectories in mid-air. In just a flash, the beams blasted through the chests of tens of people. The Sword Art—Divide move was a fearsome move taught to him by his Master’s lady, Ouyang Lulu, whereas the mental calculation he just used to come up with such a battle plan was taught by another lady of his Master, Gu Yan’er.</p><p>It was his first time using these two newly learned techniques in actual combat. The result was much to his satisfaction because he found that the Sword Art—Divide move was truly a killing technique, whereas the mental calculation could be used to clear his mind and fast thinking.</p><p>“How is this possible?!”</p><p>Disbelief and incredulity were all over the faces of the three experts in the air. Never in their wildest dreams did they think that a 20-year-old youth could actually unleash such a fearsome killing technique. They never thought that so many experts would be killed in an instant like this.</p><p>The grieve and pain, the anger and fury were unbearable.</p><p>Except for the middle-aged man who had yet to make any more, the other two instantly moved and dived down like goshawks. They couldn’t wait longer, wishing to mutilate Tang Ahlang’s body and rip it to pieces.</p><p>Tang Xiu was standing under a tree 2 kilometers away while watching the scene calmly. He naturally was very clear about the killing technique Tang Ahlang just showcased. He knew that it was a sword technique Ouyang Lulu created that suited her taste after studying various sword controlling arts in the Library Pavilion.</p><p>However, he didn’t expect that she would actually teach it to Tang Ahlang.</p><p>“Apparently, they were aware of my intention to train Ah Lang. Nevertheless, it’s a good thing since it makes Ah Lang stronger and this brat can become my right-hand man. He’ll be able to serve as the commander of the Great Tang Empire’s conquest army.”</p><p>Tang Xiu’s eyes then shifted to the jade pendant on Tang Ahlang’s waist. This protective talisman he gave him a few hours ago was able to withstand the full strength blows from experts at the Nascent Soul Stage thrice. But there was a chance that Tang Ahlang may be severely injured or killed after getting hit after three uses.</p><p>However, it was something that Tang Ahlang himself was unaware of.</p><p><em>BOOM…</em></p><p>The attack of the two big men whose cultivation level was at the Golden Core Stage was very fast and violent. Both men’s movements were swift, as fast as a lightning bolt, as they brandished their swords to clash with Tang Ahlang madly. If it wasn’t for Tang Ahlang’s fast speed, it was very likely that he’d be struck and killed by them. However, despite being superior in speed, Tang Ahlang still had to face the perilous dangers that could reap his life at any time.</p><p>“Eye for an eye and blood for blood!”</p><p>The burly man standing in the air finally moved. His figure turned into a streak of light and appeared in front of Tang Ahlang in a flash. However, his killing blow was not from his right fist that punched Tang Ahlang, but from the hair-thick shiny silver wire wrapped around his left wrist and a copper bell tied to the end of the silver wire.</p><p><em>BANG…</em></p><p>Tang Ahlang quickly avoided the lightning-fast punch, but he didn’t notice the tens of meters long silver wire with a copper bell at its end that hit his back.</p><p><em>Puah…</em></p><p>He coughed up a mouthful of blood and felt a searing pain on his back. Barely maintaining his shape, Tang Ahlang quickly moved in an arc-shaped direction as if he was a falling leaf. However, still affected by the blow, his waist and arm were stabbed by the swords of the other two burly men.</p><p>Blood flowed and dyed Tang Ahlang’s clothes red. Yet, the pain sobered him and he became much calmer instead.</p><p>The calculation process in his mind was already running lightning-fast and his mind was now able to think 100 times faster than a normal person’s brain. Although the speed was unable to match the speed of artificial intelligence, it was still terrifying given the fact that he was a human.</p><p><em>Highest level of enlightenment.</em></p><p>At this moment, Tang Ahlang seemed to have eyes on his back. The immortal sword that was previously in front of him flashed under his left arm and directly impaled the abdomen of a burly man. The sword didn’t even stop after the penetration and flickered again to ward off the slash of the saber brandished by the other man. The instant after, the immortal sword streaked upwards and seemingly moved fast for 100 feet instantly. However, the scene turned out to be a mirage, while the real body of the sword cut off the right arm of that burly man without him being able to avoid it.</p><p>“Decagonal Sword Array!”</p><p>Tang Ahlang had only used the move once, but he was already very proficient in it. Layers of sword images overlapped and formed a formation of swords and completely covered the three Golden Core Stage experts.</p><p>“You’re damned!”</p><p>A cold voice suddenly came from 100 meters away. Two figures flickered and moved lightning-fast and appeared in front of the Decagonal Sword Array in a flash. Scarlet lights blasted out from a copper mirror and the Decagonal Sword formation was instantly destroyed, while another hand brandished a sledgehammer and bombarded the immortal sword.</p><p><em>Puah…</em></p><p>The sledgehammer was cut in half by the immortal sword, but Tang Ahlang ended up spurting a mouthful of blood and flew upside down to the back, while his immortal whirred and flew back, causing a whistling sound, and eventually hovered around him.</p><p>“How long does Your Excellency want to hide in the dark? Are you really not afraid that we’ll butcher this little kid?” Of the two newly arrived people, the gray-haired man with a young-looking face coldly looked at the direction where Tang Xiu was standing.</p><p><em>Whoosh!</em></p><p>Tang Xiu instantly appeared nearby and smilingly said, “Well, I was still worried that the opponent I chose for my disciple was too weak to even serve as a tempering. I never thought that two of you would appear. But nevertheless, you both have made my worry vanish. You both are not bad, though. Your strengths can rival experts at the Nascent Soul Stage and you likely have some killing techniques as well. That’s quite good.”</p><p>The gray-haired man instantly sent the three men away and then shot a frosty stare at Tang Xiu, saying, “Who are you, Mister? I don’t think the Ximen Wandai Clan has any feud with you. Why did you come here all of a sudden and even killed our people?”</p><p>“You know, the weak like you can only serve as a stepping stone to the strong.” Tang Xiu chuckled. “But the real reason why I chose you is that you guys can serve as a tempering and sharpening tool for my disciple. However, the fact that you all wicked people are obvious. All of you reek of blood, so I won’t have any guilt killing you all. To be honest, I’m rather happy instead, since killing wicked people definitely can save countless good people.”</p><p>“Hmph. Do you really think we’re afraid of you?” the gray-haired man furiously yelled.</p><p>“You will be. That’s for sure.” Tang Xiu laughed. “But you can rest assured that I won’t get involved in the fight between you guys and my disciple, though. No matter how hard you try to save yourselves, you’re just gonna die unless you can kill my disciple.”</p><p>“Hmph! How arrogant!”</p><p>The other man whose cultivation was also comparable to a Nascent Soul Stage expert seemed to manifest his fury into a flame. His figure appeared in front of Tang Xiu in a flash and instantly brandished the saber sheathed on his back to cut Tang Xiu’s head.</p><p>“Well, might as well lighten up my disciple’s burden!”</p><p>Tang Xiu slightly smiled. His palm gently moved to the front and formed a wind blade that swept across the man’s waist instantly.</p><p>One strike! It was just a single blow, but the man was cut into two halves.</p><p>“SECOND BROTHER!!!”</p><p>“Master!”</p><p>The gray-haired man and three other men were all in disbelief. They instantly rushed in panic towards the man who had been cut in half, but quickly found that his internal organs had already fallen along with his blood.</p><p>“No need to care about him, I tell you.” Tang Xiu indifferently said, “If he was cut in half by ordinary weapons, you might still be able to save his life. But his lifeforce is completely destroyed since I was the one who did it. It’s impossible to revive him even if you’re the reincarnation of a Perfected Golden Immortal.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
