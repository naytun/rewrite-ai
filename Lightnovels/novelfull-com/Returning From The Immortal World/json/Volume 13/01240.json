They also commit robberies and endanger the security of the country. They are simply members of some underground forces that even dare to attack the police force openly. I assure you that they will spend their lives in prison.”</p><p>Tang Xiu narrowed his eyes, but most of his indifference towards the man melted away. He patted the man’s shoulder and lightly said, “As people who are responsible to uphold justice and law, you must deal with these rotten apples with severe actions. I’ll keep paying attention and assign someone to oversee this matter. You had better wipe out all the underground forces in this city in the next few months.”</p><p>Liu Yong’s eyes lit up. He then shifted his attention at the nearly 100 boys in the surroundings and suddenly asked, “Do you have a moment for a private discussion, Leader?”</p><p>“Alright.” Tang Xiu curtly replied and then looked at Wang Hu, saying, “Tell everyone else to disperse and hand over all the weapons they have to the police. I’ll give you 10,000 yuan later as compensation.”</p><p>Wang Hu’s eyes shone and he hurriedly shouted a few lines and the boys dispersed quickly.</p><p>Tens of meters away from the scene, Tang Xiu looked at the serious-looking Liu Yong and lightly said, “What exactly do you want to talk to me about?”</p><p>“Leader, the higher-ups in the province will be needed to assume command in dealing with the security problems in this city. It’s because some of the city’s officials, especially those in power, have inextricable and unclear relationships with these underground forces. I’m nothing but the Chief of the City Public Security Bureau here. I may have a heart but I don’t have the power to carry out such endeavor. I’m not afraid to tell you that the guy who leads these gangsters is a distant relative of someone in power here. Even I myself wouldn’t have dared to annoy him easily at normal times.”</p><p>“What if I give you the authority to deal with it. Do you dare to strike them?” asked Tang Xiu.</p><p>The authority to act?</p><p>Liu Yong recalled Tang Xiu’s identity and suddenly realized that the small green book might not fully represent the authority this person possessed. Which meant… this man’s identity… was definitely extraordinary.</p><p>“I’m not afraid!” Liu Yong was stimulated to go all out on this endeavor and went on with all seriousness, “Even if I have to risk everything, I’ll give everything to make the city’s public order better!”</p><p>“Alright.” Tang Xiu said, “I’ll give you a phone number. You can directly contact a certain person. His men are quite full and got nothing to do anyway, so it’s better to utilize them. You tell the person that I told you to find him.”</p><p>Liu Young noted the mobile phone number. A look of hesitation then appeared on his face before he asked, “May I ask who this person is, Leader?”</p><p>“He’s the Director of the Special Abilities Bureau, Duanmu Lin,” Tang Xiu replied lightly.</p><p>Gasp…</p><p>Certainly, Liu Yong neither had the access nor privilege to learn such particular information given his position as the Chief of the City Public Security Bureau. However, there had been a few bizarre incidents happening here, and the ones who dealt with it were those ability users from the Special Abilities Bureau. He was required to face these terrifying people and was naturally aware of what the Director of the Special Abilities Bureau represented.</p><p>These people were truly experts, who had powerful authority to move and act as the guardians of the state in the dark.</p><p>“This Liu Yong absolutely won’t fail to live up to your expectations, Leader!” Liu Yong’s neck was red due to his excitement and resolutely gave his guarantee.</p><p>Tang Xiu nodded to him in response and said, “If so, then go back now! I still have other things to tend to, so I won’t stay here.”</p><p>“Understood!”</p><p>After saluting, Liu Yong immediately issued an order to his team to return to take these savage men into custody.</p><p>Finally, there were only Tang Xiu and Wang Hu left at the school entrance. Tang Xiu then looked at Wang Hu, who looked curious, before he pointed to his Mercedes-Benz SUV and smilingly said, “Take me to a nearby bank. I’m going to withdraw some cash for you. By the way, the total sum is 60 grand, right?”</p><p>“Are you really going to give us so much money, Brother?” Wang Hu blurted out excitedly.</p><p>“Tang Xiu always keeps his words and regards it very important to deliver.” Tang Xiu nodded and said, “I may not be an Emperor and I dare not say that I’ll always deliver what I’ve promised. But I always stay true to everything I said.”</p><p>Wang Hu squeezed the lower hem of his clothes and repeatedly nodded. “I believe you, Brother. Those cops from the police station even call you leader, so I’m sure you’re a very powerful person.”</p><p>“That’s right. Care to tell me what happened to this Ah Lang?” Tang Xiu lightly smiled and asked.</p><p>Wang Hu hesitated before he shook his head and answered, “You’re our bankroller, so I mentioned him to you before. Else, I would never have revealed his identity to outsiders. I know you’re a good guy, Brother. But please don’t press me on this one.”</p><p>Tang Xiu nodded in response and lightly smiled. “I won’t force you. It’s just an impulse of my goodwill, nothing else. Else, there was no need for me to know a stranger, either, right?”</p><p>“Goodwill?” Wang Hu stared at Tang Xiu with a puzzled face.</p><p>“You told me that Ah Lang was unwell before, didn’t you?” Tang Xiu went on, “Coincidentally, I also have another identity as a Chinese medical practitioner.”</p><p>Wang Hu shook his head and replied, “No way. It’s not that I don’t believe you, Brother. But Ah Lang’s physical condition is rather special. We’ve taken him to many doctors in various cities and also visited some big hospitals in the province, none of them can cure him.”</p><p>Tang Xiu smilingly replied, “You’ve gone to the hospitals and met many doctors, then you should know about those called the Divine Doctors in Chinese medicine, right?”</p><p>“Yeah.” Wang Hu nodded and said, “I’ve heard about them indeed. It is said that there’s only but a few Divine Doctors in the whole of China, but each and every one of them has miraculous medical expertise. Unfortunately, we just can’t find them. Even if we could, we can’t afford to invite them either.”</p><p>“You know, my name is Tang Xiu.” Tang Xiu chuckled and said, “Your mobile phone should be able to access the internet, right? Try to search my name on the internet.”</p><p>“Tang Xiu?”</p><p>Wang Hu felt that the name was familiar. He felt he heard it somewhere but couldn’t recall it for a while. He then followed Tang Xiu’s suggestion and typed the name quickly. Shortly after, he saw countless links that matched the keyword, which was Tang Xiu’s name. After clicking one of the links and read the article for some time, he suddenly exclaimed, “You… you turn out to be that Young Divine Doctor of Star City Chinese Medical Hospital, Tang Xiu? Brother… you aren’t deceiving me, are you?”</p><p>“Why should I lie to you?” Tang Xiu asked back with a smile.</p><p>Wang Hu suddenly realized that this man didn’t say anything else except for mentioning his own name. After he recalled that the legendary divine doctor was standing right in front of him, his lips squirmed and then grabbed Tang Xiu’s hand, saying, “I believe that you’re a Divine Doctor, Brother. I won’t ask any sum of money from you, not even those 60 grand. You can even have my life as long as you can cure Ah Lang.”</p><p>“Well, I think you should take me to him first if you want me to cure him, no?” Tang Xiu replied, “Just tell me about his situation on the way there.”</p><p>“Copy that!” Wang Hu repeatedly nodded and looked excited.</p><p>The place was not far and there was a dilapidated house with more than ten boys in rascal clothing when Wang Hu brought Tang Xiu to the place. These youths quickly wielded their weapons and moved fast to surround them. But Wang Long, who was their leader, quickly shouted after he saw Tang Xiu, “Why did you bring him here, Brother? Ah Lang said to not bring strangers here.”</p><p>“Divine Doctor Tang is not an outsider. He’s that famous Young Divine Doctor,” Wang Hu replied, “He said he’s willing to treat Ah Lang’s illness, so I brought him here to have a try.”</p><p>A Divine Doctor… the young Divine Doctor?</p><p>When more than a dozen boys were still confused, one youth suddenly exclaimed, “I remember him! He’s the famous young Divine Doctor from Star City Chinese Medical Hospital! I… I… have seen him on the video when he treated some patients. He’s him. Absolutely.”</p><p>“Well, a doctor’s duty is to heal the sick and save people, while the title of Divine Doctor was just given by everyone. Anyway, shall we go inside and take me to see Ah Lang?”</p><p>On the way here, Wang Hu had briefed Tang Xiu on Ah Lang.</p><p>Back in the past, Ah Lang originally had four brothers and he was the youngest of the four. They were all homeless children who scoured garbage dumps to pick their food to keep them alive. Later on, they kept fighting and struggled for food with others, leading to the death of his two brothers and sent the oldest one to jail.</p><p>At that time, Ah Lang was only 12 years old.</p><p>But while he was still at a tender age, he gathered other homeless children and formed a group using his wisdom, sense of justice and righteousness before taking root in this place. Ah Lang was blessed with high intelligence, so bright that his head was like a deity’s. Following his thorough planning, the group of these street urchins and teenagers managed to make quite a lot of money, and Ah Lang even went so far to ask all of them to enter school.</p><p>Years passed by and the number of teenagers joining up kept increasing. This year, Ah Lang was 17-years-old and more than 200 street children were following him. These teenagers were all poor children living in the lowest level of society. Ah Lang provided meals and a place to live and warm clothes to fulfill their daily lives, as well as getting some education from school.</p><p>At normal times, everyone lived literally everywhere, but just one summon from Ah Lang would gather them in a moment’s notice. Unfortunately, 2 years ago when he turned 15, the severe cold led to him to contract a high fever. The fever was later subsided but left him a lot of abscesses and paralyzed in bed. Although Ah Lang kept providing advice to his brothers to make money while schooling, the sum of money they earned was much less than before.</p><p>It then became the main reason for the 100-plus teenagers among the total of over 200 to make up their minds to drop out of school and desperately did everything to earn money for a living. It was something they voluntarily and willingly did no matter how arduous and tiring the work was. They wanted to earn some money for Ah Lang’s treatment.</p><p>In their hearts, even though Ah Lang was younger than them, he was their pillar—their backbone as well as their leader.</p><p>Cough, cough…</p><p>Tang Xiu entered the house with Wang Hu and heard severe coughs from the interior.</p><p>Wang Hu strode quickly into the room and saw Ah Lang coughing on the bed in the corner of the dim room.</p><p>“How is your condition now, Ah Lang? You feel unwell again?”</p><p>While staying on the bed, the sound of Ah Lang’s cough gradually subsided. His breaths were rough and he tried to raise his hand extremely hard and weakly spoke, “I’m… fine. Please give me some water!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
