Most of the inmates here were ordinary people who had committed major criminal offenders and the number nearly reached 10,000. There was also a small number of major inmates considered as devil incarnates, as well asa number of prisoners with their death execution on a delayed schedule, or criminals on probation.</p><p>Deep inside the prison was a cell made of reinforced concrete with more than a dozen inmates. Each of whom was at least sentenced to 20 years in prison, including two men whose execution was postponed for 2 years. But to put it bluntly, the postponed death sentence was not absolute as they would only be sentenced to life imprisonment if they behaved well. Certainly, they may be sentenced to fixed-term imprisonment if their behavior was deemed excellent and could finally leave the prison.</p><p>Creak… clang!</p><p>The cell door was opened and two jailers appeared at the door. The middle-aged one in front glanced around fast to the inmates inside with a strange expression, saying, “Ah Dong, pack up your things and prepare to leave prison.”</p><p>The several inmates inside were shocked, even Ah Dong himself froze. His eyes blinked and he looked confused.</p><p>He was convicted guilty of a capital crime and would have been executed had it not been for his minor age back then. Even if his behavior was deemed excellent and he was only involved in several fights here, the most he could get would only be life imprisonment. He was perfectly aware that he would never leave prison unless there was a large-scale pardon in the country that would reduce his sentence to a fixed-term one.</p><p>Finally, a bearded middle-aged man with a naked upper body in the cell asked, “Are you not making a mistake? Ah Dong is sentenced to life prison, how could he be released now?”</p><p>Ah Dong was as though snapped back from a dream and hurriedly said, “Are you not mistaken, Captain? I… I don’t think I have served my sentence term yet!</p><p>The middle-aged jailer lightly said, “I dunno the details, either. I just received an order from the Warden to pick you up. Alright, cut the nonsense and pack up quickly.”</p><p>Ah Dong shivered before he hurriedly strode to his bunk. After quickly packing up his things neatly, he suddenly spaced out and left all his things on the bed of the big man and said aloud, “This little brother is going out and leaving these junks here. Big Brother Hu, Big Brother Yang, Old Dao, and other big brothers and uncles, I’m going out now, but I’ll come back to see you again later…”</p><p>The rest of the inmates quietly looked at him, but the big man suddenly strode forward and patted his shoulder hard, saying in a deep voice, “We accept your intention, but we don’t want to see you in this prison again later. Go and take care, Brother.”</p><p>Immediately after, the rest also came over and hugged Ah Dong, each saying farewell.</p><p>After a short while, Ah Dong stood at the cell’s door with a complex expression and said, “Then I won’t come back again since all big brothers and uncles don’t want to see me behind bars again. But as long as Ah Dong is still alive outside, I’ll continue sending money and stuff so everyone can enjoy it here.”</p><p>Having said that, he wiped the tears from the corner of his eyes and resolutely turned and walked towards the outside. After passing through the long corridor and turning over several passages, he came to the square and saw a not tall beautiful woman with arms folded.</p><p>Why would a woman appear in a man’s prison, and not wearing a police uniform, too? Ah Dong thought inwardly.</p><p>He had been in this prison for some years and now was 21-years-old. He had been living a hard and difficult life since childhood and only knew how to fight fiercely and bravely. Seeing a woman appear here was really an unusual sight for him and thus felt bizarre.</p><p>What puzzled him was that the woman standing in the square was slowly heading to the outside just like him and stayed at the gate of the prison until he arrived.</p><p>“May I know who you are?”</p><p>Ah Dong realized that this woman should be the reason why he could leave this prison.</p><p>Aquababe indifferently glanced at him and replied, “You don’t need to know who I am, and you don’t have the qualification to learn who I am, either. I was just assigned to come here to take you out of the prison. I’ve cleared up all records about you. You no longer exist either in this prison or in the whole of China. Let’s go out, some people have been waiting for you outside the gate.”</p><p>“Some people waiting for me outside?”</p><p>Ah Dong shifted to the big iron gate and nearly rushed forward when two prison guards opened the gate. He was as though getting struck by a lightning bolt when he saw the scene outside. 200-plus youths were standing on the wide road ahead—his brothers, even though they were not related by blood.</p><p>“Brother!”</p><p>Ah Lang staggered forward a few steps and then knelt 7-plus meters away from Ah Dong as he called out with a trembling voice.</p><p>“Brother!”</p><p>A loud and orderly shout followed from the 200-plus teenagers. A few of them even burst into tears and gathered with Ah Long and knelt.</p><p>Ah Dong also burst into tears and strode toward Ah Long. He knelt and hugged him, sobbing. “I missed you so much, Brother. I’ve been worried sick about you.”</p><p>Ah Lang wiped off his tears and shook his head firmly. “I’m fine, Brother. I’m really fine. I wasn’t able to come here to see you for the last six months due to some accidents. But it’s all right now since you’ve finally come out. We brothers will never be separated again from now on.”</p><p>“Yeah, we’ll never be separated anymore.” Ah Dong nodded repeatedly while hugging him tighter.</p><p>Several teenagers behind them rushed and surrounded them while stretching their hands to hold the other’s hands. The group embraced each other and created a moving sight.</p><p>Finally, Ah Lang wiped the tears on his face. He pulled Ah Dong up and said, “Brother, I can save you from prison because of my Master. I’ll take you to see him.”</p><p>“Your Master?”</p><p>Ah Dong was shaken and realized that Ah Lang’s Master was very likely a big personage in China, else he couldn’t have easily taken him out of prison.</p><p>Shortly after, the two brothers came to Tang Xiu. Ah Long pulled Ah Dong to kneel as he knocked his head toward Tang Xiu three times and said, “Brother, this is my Master. He cured me of my illness and made me much better. He is also the one who saved you. We’re all going to follow him later.”</p><p>Ah Dong was hesitant after he saw Tang Xiu’s young appearance and said, “Big Brother, Ah Dong’s life is yours to use later.”</p><p>“I’m Ah Lang’s Master, yet you address me Big Brother?” Tang Xiu let out an odd smile and said, “That would be quite messed up in seniority.”</p><p>Ah Dong stared blankly and immediately replied awkwardly, “Then, I’ll address you as Master, too.”</p><p>“No. My standard is quite strict when receiving disciples.” Tang Xiu shook his head. “I won’t accept you as a disciple unless you have a certain aspect that I can pay attention to. Call me Boss just like the rest of you later!”</p><p>Having said that, Tang Xiu pointed to the buses that had been waiting behind and said, “Ah Lang will go with me to deal with something. All of you get on those buses and the drivers will take you to Jingmen Island’s Everlasting Feast Hall. You’re going to stay there for some time and some people will take care of your life and studies.”</p><p>“But I’d like to be with Ah Lang,” said Ah Long quickly.</p><p>“You’re not yet ready and not yet qualified to stay with him for the time being,” Tang Xiu said lightly. “Remember, you must undergo training if you want to be with him later. Only those with outstanding abilities are qualified to follow Ah Lang since he’s my disciple.”</p><p>“What training and when we’re going to have it?” asked Ah Dong hurriedly.</p><p>“You won’t understand it even if I tell you now,” Tang Xiu replied lightly. “Anyway, no more questions. Get on board and go to Jingmen Island! I believe you’ll see Ah Lang soon if you work hard.”</p><p>Ah Lang himself had no idea the arrangement Tang Xiu had for him, but he wouldn’t disobey Tang Xiu’s order since Tang Xiu was the person who healed him and also saved Ah Dong from prison. He nodded to Ah Dong and said, “Big Brother, just listen to Master. He’s a good man and will definitely not harm us. I look forward to the day when we’ll see each other again later.”</p><p>Ah Dong nodded in response and said, “I’ll definitely work hard, Boss.”</p><p>Tang Xiu then waved his hand and watched as the 200-plus teenagers boarded several buses. Then, he smiled at Aquababe who approached. “Thanks a bunch for the help.”</p><p>“Nevermind it.” Aquababe shook her head and suddenly asked, “Anyway, can I also take the training you just mentioned to them?”</p><p>Tang Xiu blanked out for a moment and was at a loss whether he had to cry or laugh. “You’re not joking, are you, Aquababe? You’re a respectable psionic. What’s the point of training with a group of children?”</p><p>“I want to walk on the cultivation path. I want to be a cultivator, too,” Aquababe replied with all seriousness.</p><p>The smile on Tang Xiu’s face disappeared and he replied with a frown, “You’re a member of the Special Abilities Bureau. Choosing to follow me will be like poking on Duanmu Lin’s line.”</p><p>“I naturally have a way out to leave the Special Abilities Bureau as long as you approve it, Tang Xiu,” Aquababe replied.</p><p>Tang Xiu gave it a thought before shaking his head. “I’m sorry. I can’t promise you for the time being.”</p><p>Aquababe looked disappointed. She then hesitantly said, “Can you give me a reason?”</p><p>“You’re from the Special Abilities Bureau, which makes you a state agent,” Tang Xiu explained. “I can’t say I can trust you for the time being and I don’t want my Tang Sect having anyone related to the country. You should understand what I mean.”</p><p>Aquababe was silent for a while and then nodded. “I can understand it, but time will tell the heart of a person. I hope I can prove with facts that I really want to cultivate and become stronger, rather than being a spy and then become a traitor.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
