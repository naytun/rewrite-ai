Shortly after, tens of Tang Sect experts came out from the cabin and landed behind Tang Xiu. Nearby the ladder, a row of 10 black Audi sedans were parked with sturdy men in black suits sitting on the driver seat of each car.</p><p>With a smile hanging on her face, Kang Xia paced forward. She hugged Tang Xiu and then smilingly said, “I heard you bumped into some antic gags in Shanghai several days ago.”</p><p>Tang Xiu stared for a moment and asked with a puzzled face, “Huh? What antics?”</p><p>“Andy told me everything. Something like the house nearly catching fire.” Kang Xia chuckled.</p><p>Tang Xiu’s expression instantly turned awkward and he snappily said, “You really love hitting people’s sore points, don’t you? Bah, let’s set off!”</p><p>Kang Xia faintly smiled in response and waved to the Tang Sect experts to board the cars. As they quickly left, three other black Audis stopped quickly beside another private plane. Along with the horn’s sound from the car, boys and girls of age eighteen-plus dressed like scions of the super-rich came down the plane and quickly boarded the three cars and left.</p><p>Genesis Auction House.</p><p>After Tang Xiu and Kang Xia arrived, the tens of Tang Sect experts dispersed and began to check the security deployment of the auction house. Security was of the top priority considering the place would soon turn into a money-circulation vortex. Therefore, they received a death order from Tang Xiu that they must make the auction house an impregnable bastion where nobody could sneak in.</p><p>Further, the area within a 2km radius from the auction house must be strictly guarded against any contingency and any suspicious person approaching the site must be investigated at once, and anyone who seemed to have bad intentions must be arrested immediately. They were also permitted to neutralize such people should they resist. However, in just 2 hours after Tang Xiu’s arrival at the Genesis Auction House, tens of ability users from the Special Abilities Bureau appeared in the perimeter of the auction house about 2-5 km away to form a safe zone in the surrounding with the assistance from the undercover police force.</p><p>The fourth floor of the building had a total of four halls aside from the central hall, each of which was very spacious and housed a lot of valuables. In the past month, Genesis Auction House had accepted the commission of a large number of guests around the world and was entrusted by over 200 assignor in just a month to auction their collection.</p><p>These articles had been appraised by appraisers from four countries, as well as eight foreign appraisers all over the world, each of whom held respectable reputation, whereas the other four were Chinese treasure appraisers who were also well-known experts and professors in China.</p><p>This 12-people team conducted the appraisal to identify these over 200 articles and confirmed that the value of each item was over 1 million yuan. In other words, 1 million yuan was the lowest value of each article.</p><p>“Hao Lei, put these pills on the shelf yourself. 10 Youthful Pills; 10 Longevity Pills; 10 Antitoxin Pills; 10 bottles of Body Tempering Liquid; and 20 Essence Amassing Pill. Each of these items is set for a base price of 100 million USD.”</p><p>Hao Lei was quite shocked. She didn’t expect that Tang Xiu would sell so many cultivation resources at the auction.</p><p>“Isn’t it a bit too much, Boss?” Kang Xia slowly asked with a surprised expression.</p><p>“No. This is just a part as there will be a set of packages for these articles next.” Tang Xiu shook his head. “The package will consist of 1 Youthful Pill, 1 Longevity Pill, 1 Antitoxin Pill, 1 bottle of Body Tempering Liquid, and 1 Essence Amassing Pill with the floor price of 600 million USD for one package.”</p><p>Hao Lei memorized everything Tang Xiu just said and put all the jade bottles containing the pills on the shelf.</p><p>Shortly after, Tang Xiu also took two sets of array disks from the interspatial ring and handed it to Hao Lei. “The floor price of each of these two sets of array disks is 1 billion USD and both sets have dual effects—mainly defensive and entrapment. Those at the Golden Core Stage can only dream of breaking out from this array once they’re trapped in it. They can only hope to break this array if they can break through to the Nascent Soul Stage.”</p><p>Hao Lei wore a bit of strange expression and said, “But Sect Master, what if the people who bought these two sets of array disks become our enemies in the future? Will they pose a threat to us? I know what you intend to do in the future, which includes rooting out those foreign enemy forces.”</p><p>Tang Xiu lightly smiled and said, “I’ll teach the methods of cracking these two sets of array disks to all disciples after selling them. They won’t pose any threat to us even if we encounter them in the future. The enemy who dares to use these array disks to deal with us will be hoisted by their own petards.”</p><p>“You’re really wise, Sect Master.” Hao Lei praised with eyes lit up.</p><p>With a slight smile, Tang Xiu took out 100 talismans and said, “Divide these talismans into five packages, 20 pieces each, and its floor price is 200 million US dollars.”</p><p>“Understood!” Hao Lei received them.</p><p>Then, Tang Xiu took out 2 magic swords, 2 magic lances, 2 magic axes, 2 magic sabers and continued, “The base price of each of these magic weapons is 500 million US dollars and each is to be auctioned separately.”</p><p>Hao Lei took them, put them away and then asked, “Is there anything else?”</p><p>Finally, Tang Xiu took out a set of jewelry and smilingly said, “I also manufactured this set of jewelry myself. Its only function is for defense. The wearer of this jewelry can withstand the full blow of a Nascent Soul Stage expert. However, the effect will only last thrice and it will be useless after 3 uses. Therefore, owning this jewelry is equivalent to having three lives more and the floor price for this one is 1 billion USD.”</p><p>Hao Lei glanced at the dazzling jewelry and couldn’t help but gulp. She liked the design of the jewelry as well as its effect. After hesitating for a moment, she asked, “Boss, is there any such jewelry for sale in our sect? I… also want a set.”</p><p>Tang Xiu grinningly replied, “Well, you can expect that all core disciples of the Tang Sect can obtain a set of this jewelry type or some other types of defensive weapons in 2 years.”</p><p>Hao Lei was excited upon hearing this and heavily nodded. “By the way, we still have a couple of days from the auction time, Sect Master, and 685 guests have already confirmed attendance. But the number will likely double if we publish these treasures.”</p><p>“Don’t announce the specific number, just the type, and their effects,” said Tang Xiu without hesitation. “Also, announce to the public that those who don’t confirm their attendance to the Genesis Auction House within 3 days will lose their eligibility to attend the auction.”</p><p>“Understood,” Hao Lei respectfully replied.</p><p>It was dusk when Tang Xiu and Kang Xia had dinner together and Mu Wanying came in a hurry and brought him a message that a man named Hu Shaokun was looking for him and looked very anxious.</p><p>Hearing Hu Shaokun’s name made Tang Xiu recall another issue when he was on Jingmen Island and received a call from Li Cai. He had originally scheduled to meet her in Star City, but Li Cai failed to come at the appointed time and never came to Star City.</p><p>“Where’s he?” asked Tang Xiu.</p><p>Mu Wanying glanced at Kang Xia first before replying, “He’s at Lulu’s Paradise Manor. We had called you before, but you turned off your cell phone, so I could only come here.”</p><p>Tang Xiu nodded in response and asked, “Have you had dinner yet?”</p><p>“I was about to have dinner, but then Hu Shaokun said that it was urgent and he had to hurry to find you.” Mu Wanying shook her head and said, “I didn’t know you were here, so I contacted Hao Lei and learned that you were here. I have also notified Hu Shaokun that you’re here.”</p><p>Tang Xiu turned to Hao Lei and said, “Issue an order that if a young man named Hu Shaokun comes over, directly bring him to me.”</p><p>“Understood!” Hao Lei nodded and left.</p><p>Tang Xiu pulled a chair for Mu Wanying and asked if she wanted to have a meal. Then, he said, “You already know Kang Xia, so I’ll skip the introduction. The two of you have a bite first. I’m going downstairs to have a look.”</p><p>Mu Wanying hesitated, but eventually took a seat and said, “Shall we have some wine, Kang Xia?”</p><p>“Fine with me!” Kang Xia chuckled.</p><p>Half an hour later.</p><p>Tang Xiu was smoking at the gate of the Genesis Auction House when he saw Hu Shaokun ran towards him with the guidance of an expert from the Tang Sect. His face was full of sweat with eyes full of restlessness.</p><p>“Tang Xiu, please save Li Cai!”</p><p>After running and stopping in front of Tang Xiu, Hu Shaokun couldn’t help but pant and hurriedly cried out.</p><p>Tang Xiu’s expression changed and asked, “What happened to her?”</p><p>“I have no idea about the details, but Li Cai suddenly got a fever and fell into a coma when she was supposed to go to Star City to meet you over a month ago.” Hu Shaokun explained. “She stopped me when I was going to find you. She said that she has troubled you too much and didn’t allow me to contact you. But I can’t just do nothing since she has been in a coma for three days straight and her body temperature has exceeded 45 degrees. A normal person would have died already.”</p><p>Tang Xiu took a deep breath and said in a deep voice, “She’s still staying at the Blue Starfish Mansion, right? Take me there.”</p><p>Hu Shaokun turned around and walked with Tang Xiu for 2 kilometers to his car. After starting his car, he glanced at Tang Xiu in the back seat and said, “Do you know what happened to her, Tang Xiu? Also, Auntie Zhang is now awake and she’s kinda in high spirits and just a bit weak. It’s estimated that she will recover as before in about 10-15 days as long as she rests well.”</p><p>Tang Xiu zoned out for a moment before he immediately shook his head and sighed. “Maybe I know the reason.”</p><p>“What’s the cause?” asked Hu Shaokun with a puzzled look.</p><p>“Are there any scars on Li Cai’s wrist?” asked Tang Xiu, “Like one that’s usually seen on brokenhearted women who commit suicide by cutting their wrists?”</p><p>“That’s right! I was shocked and asked what happened to her when I saw that her wrist was injured.” Hu Shaokun blurted out without hesitation. “She said she accidentally cut her wrist.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
