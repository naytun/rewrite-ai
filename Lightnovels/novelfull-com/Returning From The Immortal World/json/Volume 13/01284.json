We now have 50,000 people in the Martial Army, added with a number of experts coming with you here, it shouldn’t be too difficult to utterly destroy them, should it?”</p><p>Tang Xiu didn’t answer Tang Ahlang’s question and said, “Xue Yu should have followed you here. Tell her to come out to see me!”</p><p>Tang Ahlang was bewildered and asked with a puzzled expression, “Huh? I’ve never seen Madam Xue Yu here, Master?!”</p><p>Tang Xiu creased his brows and instantly released his spiritual sense and found Xue Yu’s figure near the seaside shortly. Mixed in among a squad, Xue Yu was wearing a black battle suit. Tang Xiu shook his head with a wry smile and suddenly appeared in front of her. He then said with a helpless expression, “Have you been having some fun here?”</p><p>The moment Xue Yu saw Tang Xiu, a curved arc of a smile immediately sketched on her face and she grinningly said, “Well, quite fun indeed! I already knew that the legion has remarkable combat capabilities previously, but it was still shocking to tens of thousands of legionaries in action at the same time. But how did you know I’ve been following this army, though?”</p><p>“You tagged along with the Martial Army, Kang Xia is following the Dragon Army, Ouyang Lulu is with the Tiger Army, and Mu Wanying is secretly following the Phoenix Army. Of course, there are still some experts of the Great Tang Empire who have been secretly following you all since I was the one who arranged them to do so.”</p><p>“Huh?” Xue Yu was surprised. “Why didn’t I find them at all?”</p><p>“They are from the Assassination Department, that’s why.” Tang Xiu lightly smiled in response.</p><p>Xue Yu instantly understood and said with a wry smile, “Ah, the whereabouts of each and every one of those in the Assassination department trained by Tang An is always bizarre. It’s really not easy to find their tracks. Additionally, Yan’er was the one who trained those freaks for a long time. I’m afraid the weakest among them should have reached the Spirit Formation Stage, yes?”</p><p>“They indeed have reached the Spirit Formation Stage, but it’s still a chasm compared to an expert like you who has reached the Body Integration Stage, though.” Tang Xiu chuckled and said, “Anyhow, I didn’t expect your cultivation to be so fast. To think that you improved so much in such a short time. Maybe it won’t be long before you can break through to the Great Ascension Stage, right?”</p><p>“To have a bit faster cultivation speed is just natural for anyone who gets the inheritance of an Exalted Immortal, I think.” Xue Yu smiled and said, “Anyway, you shouldn’t be here. How come you’re here now?”</p><p>“We got a particular situation here.” Tang Xiu’s expression turned serious. “The leader of the Darkwind is actually from another world, so I rushed over to take over the operation. Anyway, let’s head off to someplace to see this King of Hell fella.”</p><p>“Well, you got a big tone, you know. You even dare to call this King of Hell or whatever.” Xue Yu shook her head and sighed smilingly.</p><p>“Meh, don’t take this guy lightly.” Tang Xiu said, “Being able to come here from another world, he’s obviously very strong. He should be at least at the Great Ascension Stage, I think.”</p><p>While chatting, Tang Xiu hugged Xue Yue’s waist and flew towards Yama Island instantly. It took him and Xue Yu only a few minutes to appear on the periphery of Yama Island. After observing the scene covered by the dark mist in front, Tang Xiu shook his head and sighed. “The place is indeed very hidden. It’s impossible for any spy and recon satellite to spot any abnormalities and discover this island unless you come in person and are able to detect the abnormalities yourself.”</p><p>“Is it caused by arrays?” Xue Yu creased her brows.</p><p>“Yup.” Tang Xiu nodded. “It’s indeed caused by arrays, and not your ordinary arrays either.”</p><p>Having said that, Tang Xiu instantly released his perception and quickly understood the array formation in front. It took him only 10 minutes to completely understand 13 arrays in the surroundings, and he only faced some difficulties in the 14th layer. But after a few minutes of delay, he was also able to completely understand it.</p><p>“Break…”</p><p>Tang Xiu instantly unleashed the divine sword. It shot forward like a rainbow arrow toward Yama Island’s direction. In just a flash, the 14 outermost arrays were easily broken.</p><p>On Yama Island.</p><p>King Yama stood in front of a holographic array, staring dumbly and tongue-tied after seeing Tang Xiu’s sword strike. His heart pounded and hammered his chest as he watched the arrays break.</p><p>“How is this possible?”</p><p>He was sure that the youth just shortly arrived at the periphery outside. Yet, it only took a short time for him to see through and easily figure out the crux of the arrays he arranged. This was just outright unbelievable.</p><p>Black Fox likewise looked horrified and hurriedly said, “How did he do that, King Yama? 14 layers of arrays, each of which is very powerful. How could he break all of them with one sword strike?”</p><p>King Yama took a deep breath and said in a deep voice, “I originally had 2 trump cards. The first being my own strength and second the 18 layers of arrays. I didn’t expect there actually to be people in the Great Tang Empire proficient in arrays. It’s very likely this person’s attainment on this aspect is far above me.”</p><p>“But how is that possible?” Black Fox was shocked. “Your accomplishments in arrays are something that no one in the Nine Netherworld or even the entire Hell can be compared with, right? This guy is still very young, it’s still acceptable if he has a high cultivation level. But how can he possibly have higher accomplishments in arrays compared to you?”</p><p>King Yama’s face became ugly. He shook his head and said, “There’s nothing impossible in the infinite universe. This guy is definitely a freak among the freaks. If he can break the remaining four array formations, I’m afraid we must put our previous chance on hold. In case that his accomplishment in arrays is more powerful and he takes action to arrange one, the blow we’ll face will definitely be devastating.”</p><p>Black Fox’s pupils shrunk. She nervously stared at the holographic screen and secretly prayed that the remaining four arrays could obstruct this young man and keep him outside.</p><p>On the periphery of Yama Island, Tang Xiu stood high in the sky. His eyes seemed to be able to penetrate the remaining four arrays and see the people within. A loud, thundering voice then came out of his mouth, “Hey you, the leader of Darkwind called King of Hell or whatever. You came from another world yet you’re able to form an intelligence network all over the world. You might as well come out to see me. I give you my word that I won’t ambush and kill.”</p><p>After hesitating for a moment, King Yama disappeared from the tower in a flash. In the next moment, his figure reappeared on the coastline of Yama Island. He shot a look at Tang Xiu outside the array and indifferently said, “If I recognize you correctly, you must be the Sovereign of the Great Tang Empire, Tang Xiu, yes?”</p><p>“You have good eyes,” Tang Xiu smilingly replied.</p><p>“Tang Xiu, we have been minding our own business. I don’t recall the Darkwind doing anything against your interests, either,” King Yama indifferently said. “Why did you go so far as to make things difficult for my organization and lead your Great Tang Empire’s armies to kill us?”</p><p>“You’ve been disrupting order and broke the balance among mankind, that’s why,” Tang Xiu calmly said. “You went so far as to expose people’s private information and make money out of it. Hence, you became a threat to us. So, let’s chat. You want me to stop, then take out your people from this place and go back to your world. Otherwise…”</p><p>“Heh, otherwise what? You will kill me or something?” King Yama sneered.</p><p>“Killing is easy given my current strength.” Tang Xiu nodded. “The reason why I didn’t break the remaining arrays directly or attacked you now is to give you and my men a chance.”</p><p>“You wanna use my Darkwind organization to train your troops, huh?” King Yama sneered again.</p><p>“How smart and wise you’re, Your Excellency.” Tang Xiu gave a thumbs-up and praised. “Seems like my trivial ideas can’t be concealed from you. So, what do you think about my condition?”</p><p>“Heh, nothing good to be said about it.” King Yama sneered. “I’m not leaving unless you can break the arrays I’ve arranged in a short time.”</p><p>Tang Xiu shook his head and said, “You know, it’s easy for me to break them, but I think it’s not yet the time to do so.”</p><p>“Hmph. I admit that your accomplishment in arrays is remarkable enough since you can break the outermost 14 arrays,” King Yama contemptuously said. “But the remaining four layers are the most powerful arrays I can arrange. Breaking them won’t be easy even if it is you.”</p><p>“Are you sure?”</p><p>During the talk with King Yama, Tang Xiu’s spiritual sense penetrated the 15th array and he completely understood it. Talking to this King of Hell was simply his intention to delay time.</p><p>“Of course I’m sure about this,” King Yama proudly replied.</p><p>Tang Xiu faintly smiled and unleashed his divine sword again and powerfully struck the eye of the 15th array in front, destroying it directly and making it vanish instantly.</p><p>Incredulity and disbelief were all over King Yama’s grotesque face. He didn’t expect that Tang Xiu was truly not deceiving him. He really had the ability to easily break the remaining arrays.</p><p>“What now? Do you believe me now?” Tang Xiu took back his divine sword and asked with a smile.</p><p>King Yama took a deep breath and shook his head again. “Just try it and let me see how you do it again.”</p><p>Tang Xiu slowly took out a cigarette, lit it up, and took and exhaled several times. Then, he said, “So you wanna see my strength when breaking the arrays again, huh. Then let me show it to you once again. Sword of lightning, break!”</p><p>The divine sword accurately hit and easily destroyed the 16th array formation.</p><p>“You wanna see more?” Tang Xiu smilingly asked.</p><p>King Yama was extremely shocked. He never dreamed that Tang Xiu would really break the remaining array formations so easily.</p><p>“Who exactly are you?”</p><p>King Yama had been afraid of quite a number of people in his life, but this mysterious young man in front of him was undoubtedly the one that gave him the deepest dread.</p><p>“I’ve never altered or changed my name, you know.” Tang Xiu chuckled. “I’m the Great Tang Empire’s Emperor, Tang Xiu. I’m not only the owner of the Magnificent Tang Corporation, the offspring of House Tang of Beijing, the Young Divine Doctor of Chinese medicine in China. I’m Tang Xiu, and my true identity is a cultivator.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
