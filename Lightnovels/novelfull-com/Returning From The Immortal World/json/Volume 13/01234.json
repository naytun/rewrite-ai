It seems what’s been told in the legends is true, the Black Dragon Clan is indeed an evil one among the dragon race and they deserve to be slaughtered.”</p><p>The black dragon let out a loud dragon roar once again and laughed in madness. “HAHAHA. Why should I be a benevolent dragon when my Black Dragon Clan has been labeled as wicked evil by humans and immortals alike? Cut the damn crap! This sacred being won’t bother to exchange spat with bugs like you even though I’ve never talked with humans for hundreds of millenniums.”</p><p>Having said that, it opened its huge mouth and blasted out a monstrous black flame that swept over fast and appeared in front of Tang Xiu in the blink of an eye.</p><p>“What a wicked beast. You’re dead!”</p><p>A cold, chilling voice came from the passage to the pocket world along with a violent cold stream. Gu Yan’er in her fluttering white dress suddenly appeared in front of Tang Xiu while controlling a top-grade immortal sword as thin as a cicada’s wing that brought with it immense power. The sword instantly blasted out a 10,000-meter-long sword beam that slashed to the sky and cleaved the black flame.</p><p>“An Immortal?”</p><p>The black dragon shiveringly murmured as a bit of dread filled its huge eyes. It received grave injuries 100,000 years ago and only barely recovered some of its strength after spending 100 millenniums to hibernate and recuperate. But its present strength was only less than 1% than its prime and only comparable to an ordinary immortal who had just ascended to the Immortal World. It could keenly sense that the woman who suddenly appeared was definitely more than just an ordinary immortal.</p><p>The 10,000-meter-long sword beam that cleaved the sea of flame into halves struck the black dragon’s forehead, causing it to shriek in pain. Gu Yan’er then burst into laughter happily. “Hahaha, this small world is really great. I can finally unleash all of my power here without that damn Heavenly Dao law restriction outside, though my current power is just 1/10,000 of my prime.”</p><p>The black dragon’s huge body was sent flying backward after getting struck by the sword strike. The severe pain made it howl miserably. But Gu Yan’er’s words made its heart sink to the bottom.</p><p><em>1/10,000? Her present power is but only 1/10,000 from her heyday?</em></p><p><em>How can that be?</em></p><p><em>Could it be?</em></p><p>The black dragon pulled up his couraged and roared, “Respected Immortal! Could it be that you were once a Perfected Golden Immortal in the Immortal World?”</p><p>Gu Yan’er brandished her sword again and sneered. “Perfected Golden Immortal, huh? You’re right, I once slew over than 10 Perfected Golden Immortals and massacred over than 10,000 Golden Immortals before. You’re not weak indeed, trivial black dragon. Given the imprint of your Immortal Soul, you should have the power of a Golden Immortal before. Pity that you’re still like a bug in my eyes.”</p><p>The black dragon was scared to death and finally understood why his inborn magical ability was useless against this woman’s power. It turned out that her power was at the Perfected Golden Immortal level previously.</p><p>“That can’t be. That human…”</p><p>“Hmph.” Gu Yan’er sneered. “I know what you want to say. But my Master was once a Supreme in the Immortal World, though he turned this way due to special reasons. Yet, an evil beast like you want to kill my Master? You’re simply asking to die!”</p><p>Tang Xiu who floated in mid-air and watched as Gu Yan’er beat the black dragon could only feel a wry and bitter feeling inwardly. He used to wield fearsome power that made him stand aloof at the summit and above myriads of walks of life in the Immortal World. It never occurred to him back then that even a trivial black dragon would bully him someday.</p><p>Certainly, even though he didn’t have the confidence to fight this black dragon and win, escaping was still within his capability. But if he chose to do so, this black dragon would come after him and it would be very likely that it would wreak havoc and spell calamity to humanity on the entire Earth.</p><p>“Yan’er, kill it. I need its remains for cultivation,” Tang Xiu took a deep breath and said aloud.</p><p>“No worries, Master!” Gu Yan’er chuckled. “I’ll definitely slay this bug since it has the intention to kill you.”</p><p>The black dragon was scared to death at this moment. He endured humiliation to save its own skin for 100,000 years. It was all just to recover its original form and power so that it could return to the Ashura Realm to slay all its enemies in the future. However, it never expected that it would encounter a terrifying enemy that could erase its existence before its strength fully recovered, or even left this pocket world.</p><p><em>It shouldn’t have ended like this!</em></p><p>Regrets consuming its mind due to its previous action. The dragon felt that it shouldn’t have threatened this seemingly weak human, else it wouldn’t have annoyed such a terrifying enemy.</p><p>“Time Elapse—Space Overlaps!”</p><p>Gu Yan’er chanted a chilling line and the hazy sword image instantly split into two. Overlapping ripples burst out and cascaded in the air, but the black dragon discovered with fear that its body seemed to be trapped in the mud and, no matter how hard it struggled, its body was as though being bound by the space power.</p><p><em>“Slash…”</em></p><p>One thing that the black dragon felt very confident of was not its present strength but its formidable body. However, after its body was cleaved into halves and its last wisp of consciousness fleeted away, only regrets filled its whole being for having a rash and greedy character that finally led to a disaster to itself.</p><p><em>Whoosh…</em></p><p>Tang Xiu’s figure fluttered forward. He conjured a secret technique and unleashed every container-type object from his interspatial ring, be it jade bottles, porcelain vases, and many others to contain the scattered dragon blood.</p><p>“Seal…”</p><p>Tang Xiu cast another technique to gather the black dragon’s remains and sealed it up to prevent more of its blood from flowing out.</p><p>“Devour this dragon’s soul, Yan’er!”</p><p>Tang Xiu flicked his fingers after he fully contained all the scattered dragon’s blood into the containers and stored them. He quickly sealed up the dragon soul that attempted to flee from its body and then threw it to Gu Yan’er.</p><p>Gu Yan’er caught the Dragon Soul and hurriedly said, “You need to restore your own power too, Master. Please devour this Dragon Soul directly. You can at least reach the late-stage of Crossing Tribulation in a short time. You can start preparing to ascend after you’ve solidified your power by then.”</p><p>“No.” Tang Xiu shook his head and said, “I already obtained tremendous opportunity after coming to this world and my current power is now comparable to the Great Ascencion Stage. Having another breakthrough to the late-stage of Crossing Tribulation would be a bit too much. Yan’er, what I need now is to solidify my foundation first, rather than rushing to break through to a higher level. Besides, you still have severe injuries to treat and you just unleashed your power to slay that black dragon. It’s best for you to devour it so you can heal your injuries better.”</p><p>“Then, I’ll put away this dragon soul and wait for you to stabilize your cultivation at the Great Ascension Stage first before you can devour this Dragon Soul later.” Gu Yan’er insisted.</p><p>Tang Xiu frowned and said, “Listen to me and swallow it immediately, Yan’er.”</p><p>Seeing Tang Xiu’s solemn expression, she felt deeply moved. She no longer hesitated and directly swallowed the sealed Dragon Soul. After circulating her power according to her cultivation technique, she finally suppressed the struggling Dragon Soul and continuously refined it. Eventually, the energy from the Dragon Soul was extracted to heal her injuries, nourishing her immortal physique, as well as restoring her power further.</p><p>Two days later.</p><p>Tang Xiu and Tang An had explored many places in this pocket world, but they hadn’t managed to find its boundaries at all. Therefore, Tang Xiu conjectured that this pocket world was quite large and far beyond his previous estimation. He also obtained a colossal amount of cultivation resources in these two days, be it medicinal herbs, precious minerals, as well as other precious treasures.</p><p>“The cultivation resources here are enough for all disciples in the Tang Sect for the next hundred years. If we can get all the resources in this pocket world, I think it’s still enough to support Tang Sect for thousands of years even if it becomes a hundred times bigger than it is now.” Tang Xiu was extremely satisfied.</p><p>Tang An was also very excited. Tang Xiu gave her a few bottles of the purple blood from the fierce beast before. Her strength increased greatly after she took a bottle and broke through to the late-stage of the Nascent Soul after cultivating for 8-plus days.</p><p>She even felt that she would be able to break through to the Spirit Formation Stage once she took the remaining few bottles of purple blood. And reaching the Spirit Formation Stage was her biggest goal in the coming decades!</p><p><em>Sure enough… following Grand Master will make anyone’s cultivation speed extremely fast. The others will be envious if they learn that I’ve broken through to the late-stage of the Nascent Soul, won’t they?</em> Tang An was quite excited every time she thought about it. She didn’t like to show off, but she couldn’t help but have the impulse to show it off to the rest of the Elders in Tang Sect.</p><p><em>Whoosh!</em></p><p>A hazy figure flickered and appeared in front of Tang Xiu and Tang An. It was Gu Yan’er in her usual white dress. She shot a satisfied look at Tang An. Then, she shifted to Tang Xiu and smilingly said, “Most of my injuries have healed after devouring the Dragon Soul, Master. I’ll be able to fully recover in half a year, though my lost power can’t be restored in a short time. My current power is at the level of a peak-stage Earth Immortal, but restoring my power to the Celestial Immortal Stage would take much longer time.”</p><p>Her report made Tang Xiu happy and he said, “There’s no immortal spiritual energy in this place. It will be difficult for you to recover your power to the Celestial Immortal Stage without it. Nonetheless, staying here to cultivate will be greatly beneficial for you, and I think you’ll able to recover your power to the level of Celestial Immortal Stage in 10 years, maybe less.”</p><p>Gu Yan’er’s smiled turned extremely bright. She nodded in response and said, “The space barrier of this pocket world is very solid and it won’t collapse even if the world outside is destroyed. Furthermore, this place has a rich concentration of Purple Qi which is very beneficial to cultivators and immortals alike. I’m confident that I can restore my cultivation to the peak-stage of Celestial Immortal in a decade, Master.”</p><p>“Keep your pace on it.” Tang Xiu nodded and said, “The more strength you recover, the safer we will be in the future. Also, come with me when I leave this pocket world later. I need you to use your spiritual sense to help me find the rest of the zodiac jade carvings. I’ll be able to set up a large spatial array that can send all of us to the Immortal World as long as we find the full 12 sets of these zodiac jade carvings.”</p><p>Gu Yan’er hesitated. “Restoring my power to the level of Celestial Immortal Stage won’t be a problem, Master. But I’ll be suppressed by the Heavenly Dao laws once I go out. Even if I can find the rest of the zodiac jade carvings in a very short time, I’m bound to get injured as well.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
