I gave the proposal to start this project to Kang Xia two months ago.” Gao Beilei explained, “She and the executives of the company have discussed the project and approved it given the potential it offers. But we are kind of short of some funds needed when we were about to start the project recently. I was going to ask Kang Xia about it, but I didn’t expect you to come back suddenly.”</p><p>“How much this tourism project cost, exactly?” asked Tang Xiu.</p><p>Gao Beilei answered, “According to the previous budget, we lack…”</p><p>Tang Xiu raised his hand to interrupt her bluntly and said, “I don’t need to hear the previous budget. What I asked was the total investment of this project. How much is it?”</p><p>“About 80 billion yuan,” Gao Beilei said.</p><p><em>Huff…</em></p><p>Tang Xiu couldn’t help but take a deep breath. The tourism project that needed 80 billion yuan was something he never expected, so he couldn’t help but immediately ask, “Brief me about this tourism project first.”</p><p>“It’s because the government wants to develop the Heavenly Spring Island in the South China Sea. In order to attract investors and businesses there, the state held a tender, and the Magnificent Tang Corporation won the tender, whereas the 80 billion is the funds needed to develop the entire island. The senior executives of the company and I have conducted the analysis. If we can develop this Heavenly Spring Island in the South China Sea in its entirety, we can make it into a dream-like scenic tourist site that can attract tourists from all over the world. All in all, this is a long-term investment that will continue generating revenue for the company in the future.”</p><p>Tang Xiu pondered about it for a while and then directly took out his mobile phone. After dialing a cell number and his call was picked up, he chuckled and softly said, “How is the business going, Brother Miao?”</p><p>“Brother Tang, you’ve really… damn, it’s been 3 years! I’ve never seen nor received a call from you for the whole goddamned 3 years! I’ve been looking for you, and I was told that you went into seclusion god knows where for cultivation and you can’t contact me. Yet, the very first thing you ask me after I’ve been waiting for your call is about my business? Dammit, can’t you at least tell me you miss me or something else?” Miao Wentang’s grunt came from the phone. He sounded bitter.</p><p>“Hahaha. Okay, okay, my fault. I admit it.” Tang Xiu couldn’t help laughing and said, “Anyways, though. I do miss you, Brother Miao, so can we talk about business now?”</p><p>“You! Dammit! Alright, spill it out. What business do you want to talk to me about?” Miao Wentang grunted yet again from the phone.</p><p>“It’s about Heavenly Spring Island. 160 billion yuan ready for sale. Are you interested to take the offer?” Tang Xiu asked.</p><p>“Come again? How much?” Miao Wentang’s voice exclaimed from the phone.</p><p>“160 billion,” Tang Xiu said.</p><p>“Brother Tang, you actually practiced the credo of brothers are brothers but business is business, didn’t you?” Miao Wentang’s bitter voice replied, “I know the Magnificent Tang Corporation took over the island for some billions of yuan, yet you wanna sell it to me for 160 billion? Do you think your Brother Miao is a loaded moneybag or something?”</p><p>“Hey, hey, listen to me first, will you?” Tang Xiu chuckled and said, “My company did get the Heavenly Spring Island for some billions, but you also know the value of this island is likely more than just some billions, no? It’s not like we brothers can make it more by striving hard together, don’t you think?”</p><p>“Ah, so that’s what you mean!” Miao Wentang nodded and sighed. “You can be counted as the biggest Boss in Shanghai now, Brother. Maybe it will only take you a few years before going further as the biggest personage in the country. Given how fast you’ve been climbing up, you can even reach the peak soon. Alright then, tell me everything you wanna say, Brother Tang!”</p><p>“If you have 160 billion yuan, my company will be responsible for making Heavenly Spring Island into one of the world’s top tourist areas. Given the long-term development trend, this island will definitely become a super money-making machine later.”</p><p>Miao Wentang pondered for a while and then asked, “I won’t ask the trivialities, Brother Tang. But there’s one thing I need to ask you. Are you really <em>that</em> sure Heavenly Spring Island will become the world’s top tourist area and become a money-making machine?”</p><p>“You got my guarantee on that,” Tang Xiu replied bluntly.</p><p>After a few minutes of pondering, Miao Wentang slowly said, “Brother Tang, although the Miao Group has been developing rapidly in recent years, my company’s total assets are still less than 50 billion. It’s just impossible for me to provide 160 billion yuan. How about you contact a few more people? Or wait until I contact some people to develop this Heavenly Spring Island together? We can share in this regard, I think.”</p><p>Tang Xiu thought about it and said, “Alright, then I’ll pull some strings to build the bridge! What do you think of Long Zhengyu, Jin Xingkui, Gu Changmin, Zhang Yueming, Beijing’s Bao Family, and Brother Shao Mingzhen?”</p><p>“I’m familiar with the Long Group and got no issue with Brother Shao since I have cooperation with them.” Miao Wentang thought for a while and went on, “I’m also familiar with Jin Xingkui, Gu Changmin, and Zhang Yueming, so I won’t have a problem cooperating with them either. But I’m not too familiar with Beijing’s Bao Family at all.”</p><p>After listening to Miao Wentang’s concerns, Tang Xiu smilingly replied, “Well, Bai Tao is my friend, and the Baos are a bunch of people we can get along with. However, I still think that all of us added up to provide 160 billion yuan would still affect our primary businesses, so I’ll introduce you to one person from another family from Beijing. He’s Qin Shaoyang from the Qin Family.”</p><p>“Ah, I know about them. The Qins of Beijing indeed have strong financial resources and a good reputation in the business community.” Miao Wentang replied, “I think it’s feasible now, Brother Tang.”</p><p>“You take the leader position then!” Tang Xiu smilingly replied, “Anyway, I’ll be staying in Shanghai for at least a week. Let’s talk more about this when you come over, okay?”</p><p>“Got it!”</p><p>Miao Wentang nodded even though he was speaking on the phone. He had been acquainted with Tang Xiu for more than 5 years and thought that he knew Tang Xiu very well and had a deep trust in him. He believed that Tang Xiu wouldn’t make them suffer a loss since he was the one who proposed this Heavenly Spring Island project in the South China Sea.</p><p>After hanging up, Tang Xiu looked up at Gao Beilei at the side and immediately asked with a smile, “You think this is very accidental and feel surprised, don’t you?”</p><p>“Yeah, very unexpected!” Gao Beilei nodded.</p><p>“The Magnificent Tang Corporation only has one significant trait in its existence, which is to accumulate money fast and not to make money in the long term.” Tang Xiu chuckled and explained. “All in all, our credo is how to make the most money in the shortest time. You can say that putting out 80 billion yuan for long-term investment is completely at the opposite side of my philosophy.”</p><p>“I don’t get you, Boss. According to the current development trend of the Magnificent Tang Corporation, it’s possible for our company to be the largest company in the world.” Gao Beilei frowned. “Why are you… so shortsighted?”</p><p>“It’s not that I’m shortsighted, but rather I have my own plans and intentions,” Tang Xiu said. “I just said that the Magnificent Tang Corporation is just a tool for me to amass money, with which I can gather the most money within the shortest time. Not to mention the Heavenly Spring Island in the South China Sea, even the Magnificent Tang Company will only take out some shares and hand over the entire company to the country two years later.”</p><p>Gao Beilei was shaken, and incredulity painted her eyes and face. She hurriedly asked, “Why? What exactly do you want to achieve by doing this?”</p><p>“I have my reasons, so don’t ask me more,” Tang Xiu lightly replied. “What you have to do in the next two years is to make as much money as possible for me and enough money for yourself. Once the two-year deadline is up, I’ll give you 10% of the shares in the company. At that time, whether you’re still in charge of the company or just want to enjoy your life, you just need to wait for dividends later.”</p><p>Gasp…</p><p>Despite having a tough character, Gao Beilei couldn’t help but gasp after hearing Tang Xiu’s statement as a storm raged inside her heart.</p><p>10% shares? Just the current valuation of the Magnificent Tang Company’s total assets alone was amounted to 1 trillion yuan, give or take. 10% of the shares was equal to 100 billion.</p><p>And Tang Xiu just gave her 100 billion yuan so casually? Why?</p><p>Gao Beilei, who always thought that she was very intelligent with her high IQ, was bewildered by Tang Xiu’s decision.</p><p>In response, Tang Xiu smiled indifferently. “Don’t look so surprised. 10% of the shares are just a small reward for you. I’ll present you an extra reward if you can satisfy me with your performance within these 2 years. I guarantee the present I’ll give you will be something you can never buy even if you can become a trillionaire in the future.”</p><p>Gao Beilei shuddered inwardly and nodded wordlessly. Tang Xiu didn’t want to elaborate more, so she no longer asked. Regardless of whether she could really get 10% of the company shares in the future, she would still follow Tang Xiu’s instruction. She could only go all out and be more serious at work if she wanted to have such a handsome reward.</p><p>The cars moved fast. While sitting in the back seat, Tang Xiu’s mind was full of thoughts, thinking about the future of the Magnificent Tang Corporation. His departure from Earth to the Immortal World 2 years later was inevitable. In all likelihood, his family would also be leaving, so there was no need for the Magnificent Tang Corporation to exist anymore once he left.</p><p>However, some people would still stay here. For instance, Ouyang Lulu’s family. Even though her parents, grandparents, siblings, and a small number of her relatives would follow them, there were still many others in the Ouyang Family. He planned to gift some shares of the Magnificent Tang Corporation to the Ouyang family, and it could be counted as a dowry for her.</p><p>Aside from them, there was also the Mu Family of Beijing, Zhang Xinya and Zhang Xinyue’s relatives, Xue Yu’s relatives in the Miao Region, and many others…</p><p>Tang Xiu didn’t wish to have any regrets when he left them. He took their loved ones. However, leaving their relatives who remained on Earth with some shares of the Magnificent Tang Corporation should be enough.</p><p>Suddenly, Tang Xiu recalled another person, a woman.</p><p>He took out his phone and dialed Chen Xiaowan’s cell number. After his call was picked up, Chen Xiaowan’s surprised and happy yell came from the phone, “Where the hell did you die, Brother? You even dare to forget your own sister?”</p><p>Tang Xiu distanced the phone away from his ears until her voice was toned down a bit. Then, he smiled wryly and replied, “How could I forget you, Sis Xiaowan? It’s just I got something to deal with by myself that lasted 3 years of time. Anyway, I just returned to Shanghai from abroad and now am on the road to the Magnificent Tang Corporation from the airport, so I got time to call you.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
