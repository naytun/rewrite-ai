It felt very refreshing to him after having gone through a busy life for so long and suddenly relaxing now. He then went downstairs and had breakfast with a group of people who stayed overnight last night. Afterward, Tang Xiu, Su Ben, and Gao Beilei headed to the Magnificent Tang Corporation along with Scarface Qiang.</p><p>This morning, a message then spread throughout the company that the previous winery director, Dai Qiang, turned out to be framed and then lost his position. However, Big Boss Tang Xiu found him personally and entrusted him with a higher position as Deputy General Manager of the Magnificent Tang Corporation.</p><p>The person himself may not have an unwarranted reputation, but it still shocked many people. Further, everyone also realized that Dai Qiang had a very close relationship with Tang Xiu.</p><p>In the evening, Tang Xiu received Miao Wentang, Shao Mingzhen, and several family’s patriarchs at the Magnificent Tang Corporation, and then signed the cooperation to develop the island in the South China Sea. 80 billion yuan had been pre-paid and transferred, and the project only needed some required follow-ups to supervise. Subsequently, it was expected that the Magnificent Tang Corp.’s project in developing the island into the world’s top tourist location could be carried out smoothly. The project itself would be headed by a senior executive from Magnificent Tang Corporation.</p><p>****</p><p>The next day, Tang Xiu brought Tang Ahlang and left for the for Taklamakan Desert. The secret base built by the Chinese authority was located there, and the person in charge of the site was the Director of the Special Abilities Bureau, Duanmu Lin. Even most of this agency’s members were also stationed there.</p><p>“What have you learned from your observation after following me in the last few days, Ah Lang?” Sitting on the train bound for the southern Xinjiang, Tang Xiu calmly looked at Tang Ahlang on the couchette in front of him.</p><p>“How Master deals with people,” Tang Ahlang respectfully said.</p><p>“Only this aspect?” asked Tang Xiu with a faint smile.</p><p>“In general, it’s indeed only this aspect, though there are also some more important details to emphasize.” Tang Ahlang shook his head and continued, “Master met acquaintances to maintain and to grow the relationship between both sides. You also subtly approached people close to you to set off on our journey in the future. Other than that, you made decisive and fast decisions when you removed all the unwanted elements in the Magnificent Tang Corporation. All in all, all the events show that you’re someone who has ways with people and also greatly attaches importance to relationship and righteousness.”</p><p>“I don’t recall asking you to comment on my conduct, Brat.” Tang Xiu rolled his eyes and snappishly said.</p><p>“I just expressed what I’ve learned from you, Master,” Tang Ahlang smilingly replied.</p><p>“What is it?” asked Tang Xiu curiously.</p><p>“Wisdom.” Tang Anhlang smiled.</p><p>“Meh, if you wanna kiss my ass, just do it directly and don’t beat around the bush.” Tang Xiu shook his head and smilingly said, “Anyway, what’s your progress in learning the content of the array manual?”</p><p>“I’ve grasped 30% of it, but I have to consult the remaining 70% with you since I don’t understand them,” Tang Ahlang answered. “I’ve marked everything I don’t yet understand, so I guess I’m going to ask you now.”</p><p>“Alright!” Tang Xiu nodded.</p><p>The two of them then sat on their respective soft couchettes. Tang Xiu himself had previously considered instructing Tang Ahlang the knowledge about arrays whenever he had time, so he reserved this four-couchette room.</p><p>Time passed by quickly.</p><p>All the way on the road, Tang Xiu lectured and Tang Ahlang studied. Both master and disciple were enthusiastic to play their roles. Finally, after changing special cars a few times, the two people stood on the edge of the Taklamakan Desert. Tang Xiu also bought a lot of daily necessities on the way here, including food and water, all of which were stored in his interspatial ring. Therefore, he didn’t need to worry about the lack of supplies in the desert.</p><p>Two days later.</p><p>At this time, Tang Xiu arrived at a flat ground in the desert and calmly walked with Tang Ahlang. Finally, the two of them stopped at the edge of an oasis.</p><p>“It should be around here given the position, Master,” Tang Ahlang took out a map from the interspatial ring and said after carefully observing the location and comparing it with the map.</p><p>“Yeah, it should be here.” Tang Xiu nodded. “What else do you notice?”</p><p>Tang Ahlang carefully observed the surroundings and thought in silence. Then, he said, “The communication signal here has been shielded since my cell phone caught no signal, and the energy fluctuations in this place are rather abnormal given the compass isn’t working, either. Further, I’ve observed this oasis too. It’s quite strange, there’s no sign of life nor any source of water. On the contrary, the world’s spiritual energy here is rich beyond my expectations. Such a situation shouldn’t be possible given the location. Lastly, the temperature the moment we came to this oasis differs from the outside roughly by at least 20 degrees. This is not normal.”</p><p>“Your observation is quite thorough and attentive, but rather ordinary coming from you.” Tang Xiu smiled slightly.</p><p>“There’s something else?” Tang Ahlang confused.</p><p>“Try to take a look around to the distance from the spot we’re standing now. Do you notice something different from the area when we walked here?”</p><p>Tang Ahlang thought more for a while and then said with an ashamed expression, “You’re right, Master. When we saw the oasis from the outside, the area was just about four basketball courts in size. But after we came here, the visual distance I can see is at least up to 2 kilometers, and I can’t see anything beyond 2 km. Further, although we paused for a while, we only walked for about less than 500m, meaning that the visual distance we can see outside is different from the real size of the area here.”</p><p>“You just said before that the world’s spiritual energy here is a bit different, and so is the energy fluctuation. Haven’t you figured out why?” Tang Xiu added.</p><p>Tang Ahlang thought for a while and then suddenly said, “Ah, this oasis is covered by an array! It’s just I wasn’t able to sense it when we came from the outside.”</p><p>“That’s right. This area is indeed blanketed by an array, and I was the one who arranged it myself.” Tang Xiu smiled and said, “The area of this oasis is roughly around 1,000 square kilometers, but it looks to be reduced in size by several folds after I arranged the array. As a double precaution, I also shielded any communication signal within a few hundred kilometers area and arranged a special magnetic field. Therefore, even those satellites in orbit won’t be able to detect anything in this place.”</p><p>“Is there anything particular in this place, Master?” Tang Ahlang was bewildered.</p><p>“You’ll know about it soon.” Tang Xiu smiled lightly. “Also, stay silent later and just listen, observe, and think. Well, some people are going to see us here.”</p><p>“Umm?”</p><p>Tang Ahlang’s expression slightly shifted after hearing this and his gaze suddenly shifted into the distance, surprised. A spot in the midst of a green expanse of grass 200 meters ahead suddenly opened up and a green vehicle came out fast shortly after, coming towards them in several seconds.</p><p>Bam…</p><p>The car’s door was quickly opened and two young men holding rifles came out. Both of them wore LCD goggles and aimed their guns at Tang Xiu and Tang Ahlang with vigilance.</p><p>“Who are you and how did you get here?” One of the young men in camouflage suit coldly asked in a deep voice.</p><p>“You don’t know me, so you’re new here, aren’t you?” Tang Xiu smiled and said, “Don’t tell me Duanmu Lin has yet to hang my photo in this base for you to respect?”</p><p>“Huh…”</p><p>The two young men exchanged dismayed glances and immediately looked angry. The one that just talked lifted his gun’s muzzle and shouted, “Do you think you can just say the name of our Chief? Who the hell are you? Answer me, else don’t blame us for taking hard measures!”</p><p>Tang Xiu narrowed his eyes and glanced at the guns in their hands. He then smilingly said, “That must be a laser gun, yes? It should be quite powerful and able to penetrate iron walls at least about 50cm. Try to shoot me. I want to see if this gun is as powerful as recorded in the data.”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>The two men were dumbfounded. They never dreamed that Tang Xiu knew that the guns in their hands were laser guns. It must be noted that the laser gun had just been developed roughly a year ago. It was quite powerful with an extremely far firing range. They could see their long-range targets as long as they wore long-range vision LCD goggles.</p><p>Still, was there something wrong with this guy’s head? He wanted them to shoot at him with such a powerful laser gun? Did he want to commit suicide or something?</p><p>“Where the hell did this lunatic come from?”</p><p>Both of them faintly had a headache and hesitated.</p><p>“What are you two worried about, huh?” Tang Xiu lightly smiled and said, “I told you to shoot me and let me have a look, didn’t I? I’m really curious whether the developed laser gun is really as powerful as reported.”</p><p>The eyes of the young man who spoke glinted. He had a faint hunch that the young man standing in front of him shouldn’t be ordinary. It was very likely that he was also an ability user like him. He had just awakened his special ability about one and half a year ago and then became a quite formidable ability user after undergoing training. Further, this place was the most secretive and important base in the country, and the people who could casually come here were not ordinary people.</p><p>“Shoot!”</p><p>He took a deep breath and pulled the trigger to shoot Tang Xiu.</p><p>Zap…</p><p>A laser beam was shot from the gun and directly hit Tang Xiu’s chest. The youth expected that the guy in front of him would be severely injured even if he didn’t die. It was because he himself would also be injured even though he was an ability user.</p><p>However, what happened next left him utterly flabbergasted. The laser beam that hit the chest of the young man in front of him simply stopped and was unable to move forward. The laser beam seemed to be blocked by a transparent energy shield.</p><p>“No way!”</p><p>The young man’s eyes bulged out and nearly popped out. He saw that the laser beam was not only able to injure this stranger but also unable to leave any scratch on this young man’s clothes.</p><p>This…</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
