The Great Tang Empire, which once set off the whole wave of terror on Earth by destroying the top three organizations in the world, House Dolan, and the terrorist forces of the Darkwind organization, had completely disappeared from the world.</p><p>Still, no one dared to ignore this force, especially those figures and forces in power. All of them chose to stay dormant, quietly waiting for the next storm the Great Tang Empire might set off.</p><p>Four days to the designated time.</p><p>At the flight line of Shanghai Airport, Li Laoshan was leaning on a black Mercedes-Benz SUV, smilingly looking at Tang Xiu step down the ladder. Counting the time, it had been more than 3 years since the last time he met Tang Xiu. He oftentimes daydreamed and missed the days they spent together.</p><p>The difference in their ages was obvious, but they were the best of friends in spite of it.</p><p>Li Laoshan looked at Tang Xiu as he got closer. Opening his arms, he moved to hug him and smilingly said, “Damn, I’m so glad you came back, Brother! But why didn’t you at least cry out to call me when you got out of the cabin?”</p><p>Tang Xiu patted Li Laoshan’s back before releasing him, then smilingly said, “Me calling you over? Say, like you wanted me to yell, ‘Hey, buddy. I, Hu Hansan, am back’ or something? Hahaha… Anyways, your tonnage seems much better than ever, Fatty Old Bro!”</p><p>Li Laoshan blushed and rolled his eyes at Tang Xiu in response. He shot back snappishly, “Shit, you really know how to hit my sore point, don’t you, brat? But it’s true that I was kinda ecstatic when you called me yesterday. You dumb head really got no conscience, only remembering your old bro at this time. Just tell me, you won’t leave again after returning this time, right?”</p><p>Tang Xiu put away his smiling face and said, “I’m only here for a day and will be leaving the day after tomorrow. This may be the last time we meet, Brother.”</p><p>“What the heck do you mean?” The smile on Li Laoshan’s face froze. He stared daggers at Tang Xiu and asked.</p><p>Tang Xiu didn’t explain and helplessly said, “Old Brother Li, how about you take the wheel and I sit on the front seat?”</p><p>Li Laoshan pondered for a moment before giving instructions to his driver. He immediately got into the driver’s seat. As Tang Xiu got inside, Li Laoshan immediately started the car and drove out of the airport. The reason why he could take his car into the airport was thanks to borrowing Tang Xiu’s name.</p><p>After the car left the airport, Li Laoshan began the conversation with a serious face.”I know you very well, Brother Tang. You never speak nonsense. Where exactly are you going this time?”</p><p>Tang Xiu pointed his finger upward and calmly replied, “I taught you a cultivation technique in the past, so you should have gained some achievements in your cultivation in the past few years. You also know that a man always seeks his way up just as water seeks its way down. I can break the barrier of this world soon, so it’s meaningless for me to stay here longer. That’s why I want to meet some of my longtime brothers before I leave.”</p><p>Li Laoshan fell into silence.</p><p>Speaking about walking on the cultivation path, he indeed had entered into this rank and could be regarded as a cultivator himself. After all, he had been cultivating for several years and his strength was now at the Foundation Establishment Stage. He already knew that Tang Xiu was going to become an immortal. However, he had long been aware of his own lacking aptitude. It was nearly impossible for him to reach such a cultivation realm and then ascended to become an immortal and meet with Tang Xiu in the Immortal World.</p><p>Thus, as Tang Xiu just said, this meeting would be the last time the brothers could meet in this life.</p><p>In the evening.</p><p>The two brothers got drunk at Paradise Manor. Afterward, Li Laoshan was taken away by his bodyguards to rest, whereas Tang Xiu intentionally didn’t force out the alcohol of his system. He just took a shower leisurely while washing away all the unwillingness. Then, he changed his clothes and drove back to the Bluestar Villa Complex.</p><p>At this moment, a group of young people had gathered in Tang Xiu’s villa. Some of them didn’t know each other and some others were already acquaintances. But all of them conversed harmoniously due to each being related to Tang Xiu.</p><p>“Shit, why hasn’t Big Bro come back yet? The dishes delivered by the Everlasting Feast Hall will be cold soon.” Long Zhenglin caressed his bald head while his burly figure leaned on the door of the room and his eyes gazed outside.</p><p>Yuan Chuling, who had added more tonnage to his weight recently, was hugging a curvy hot girl with a delicate face. He put out the cigarette and smilingly said, “Big Bro said that he’ll come back, so he definitely will, Long Zhenglin. Man, I’ve not seen him for years already. I’ve been missing him for so many years, and I don’t give damn care to wait for a bit longer.”</p><p>Long Zhenglin rolled his eyes and let out a strange grin. “You miss Big Bro, huh? Isn’t the belle in your arms going to be jealous?”</p><p>“Nah, I’m not jealous,” the hot girl tilted up her chin and smilingly said.</p><p>The quiet girl next to Yue Kai suddenly interjected. “I think she’ll be jealous. That’s for sure. Some men here do care more about their brothers than their women. That makes me very jealous.”</p><p>“Hahaha…”</p><p>The whole house burst into laughter.</p><p>Aside from Long Zhenglin, there were also Yuan Chuling, Yue Kai, Hu Qingsong, Zhao Liang, Xue Chao, Long Zhengyu, Ji Mu, Bai Tao, Huang Xu, Fei Shan, Qin Shaoyang and some others. Besides these young masters, there were also six girls who were the companions brought by some of them, as well as their girlfriends or wives.</p><p>Suddenly, Long Zhengyu’s eyes lit up as he gazed at the door and ran towards outside, shouting, “You’re back, Big Bro!”</p><p>Right as Tang Xiu entered the gate of the courtyard, he saw Long Zhenglin rushing towards him, smiling and stretching his arms to give him a big hug. After releasing each other, the rest of his longtime brothers also rush out of the villa.</p><p>The scene was full of laughter and merry.</p><p>The group of young people in their 20s stayed in the courtyard for a long time.</p><p>After everyone returned to the villa’s living room, Tang Xiu glanced at the six girls while Long Zhengyu introduced them. Afterward, he directly took out six jade pendants from the interspatial ring and handed them to the six females, saying, “Older Sisters-in-law, Younger Sisters-in-law, I’ve met some of you but not others. However, since you all come together with my brothers, I’d like to offer my sincere blessings to you all. I hope you can accept this first meeting gift from me.”</p><p>The six females all knew Tang Xiu’s identity, so they didn’t refuse. After saying thanks, the curvy girl even praised. “Big Brother, you have no idea how Yuan Chuling keeps giving me an earful of how great you are all day long. But seeing you in person is really much better than hearing about you from him hundreds of times. I’m really glad Brother Yuan can have a brother like you.”</p><p>Tang Xiu slightly smiled in response and then said, “Sisters-in-law, I didn’t expect that my brothers would bring you all here. But since we’ve met, would all sisters-in-law be kind enough to accept my invitation and play at Paradise Manor? The people there will arrange everything for you.”</p><p>“Ehh? What do you mean?” The curvy, hot girl stared blankly before she subconsciously turned to stare at Yuan Chuling.</p><p>At this moment, several young people in the room also looked confused and stared bewilderedly at Tang Xiu. They knew Tang Xiu and understood the meaning in his words. It was obvious that Tang Xiu wanted these females and their family members to leave.</p><p>Yuan Chuling frowned and asked again, “Big Brother, are you…”</p><p>Tang Xiu ignored him. He looked at the door with a smile and said, “Tang 28, tell the others to prepare cars and take them to Paradise Club. Remember to tell the General Manager there to prepare delicious dishes and drinks. Tell him to satisfy these ladies’ requests as best as he can.”</p><p>“Understood!”</p><p>Tang 28 flashed from the outside and entered. He then looked at the six females and said, “Please follow me, ladies.”</p><p>Finally, the six females followed Tang 28.</p><p>Tang Xiu then turned around. He glanced over everyone’s faces and then said aloud, “Somebody, please move out the dinner table from the dining room over here.”</p><p>Suddenly, four 12-years-old teenagers showed up from the other room and dashed to the dining room. They quickly moved the dining table and chairs to the living room. The tea table originally placed in the living room was moved away, leaving only some sofas that were moved outward a bit.</p><p>Long Zhengyu creased his brows and asked, “What’s wrong with you, Tang Xiu?”</p><p>Tang Xiu didn’t respond and waved his hand instead, as 10 boxes of God’s Nectar suddenly appeared on the table. Afterward, he quickly opened the wine box and took out a bottle of God’s Nectar and removed the remaining 60 bottles in front of everyone. Flicking his finger, the 60 bottles’ caps were plugged out. Only at this time did Tang Xiu speak in a deep voice, “Brothers, I’m going to drink 3 bottles of God’s Nectar to show my respect for you all.”</p><p>Having said that, he downed 3 bottles of God’s Nectar in one breath. The moment everyone’s face changed, Tang Xiu wiped off the alcohol stains from the corner of his mouth and spoke again in a deep voice, “I have a bad personality, and it has been very difficult for me to make real friends. However, I was lucky to meet you guys.”</p><p>Long Zhengyu interjected, “Please don’t say that, Tang Xiu. You’re someone who values relationships and virtues, we…”</p><p>Tang Xiu raised his hand to interrupt him. He then took a deep breath and said, “Please listen to me first. I’ve always been very cautious and wary even when I’ve become brothers with you guys. It was because I’ve once experienced the bitter taste of betrayal that left deep pain in my heart. But then, I met all of you, people whom I really recognize as brothers. All of you are this Tang Xiu’s brothers—my brothers.</p><p>“Brother is not a word you need to say, but one that one admits in the heart. From today on, I’ll engrave the face of each of you in my heart. Even if today is the last time we meet, I absolutely will never forget you all.”</p><p>After speaking, Tang Xiu took out a few packs of cigarettes. He opened one, took a cigarette and then lit it up. He took several puffs before he slowly said, “I’m going to leave. And this time… I’m perhaps leaving for eternity.”</p><p>Long Zhengyu dashed toward Tang Xiu, stared daggers at him, and then spoke in a deep voice, “The transportation means today is very developed. No matter where you are in the world, we can find you as long as we miss you. Please don’t say such a farewell. It’s like saying we’ll be separated in life and death. We’re brothers and will forever be brothers for a lifetime!”</p><p>Tang Xiu forced a smile and said, “I, too, believe in your last line, but the place I’m going to is not in any corner of this Earth. I’m a cultivator. I know you may have discovered some particularities and anomalies around me after getting along with me for so long, and heard of my identity as a cultivator. If anything, I have my path I must traverse on, whereas you guys also have a life you want to live forward. Although I do wish to have you guys by my side as I go forward, you have your own path to take, while I must take my own.”</p><p>“Where are you going to, exactly?” Long Zhengyu asked in a deep voice.</p><p>“The Immortal World.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
