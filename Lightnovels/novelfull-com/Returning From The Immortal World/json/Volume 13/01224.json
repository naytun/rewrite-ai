At the same time, the breathing of thousands of practitioners turned heavy as their desires were aroused.</p><p>In this world, such a magic weapon was something one could only find through fortuitous encounters but not at will. If the cultivator was an expert spearman and obtained this lance, that person would definitely become more powerful and his combat effectiveness would rise exponentially.</p><p>“2.5 billion dollars! It’s the amount of liquid cash I can put out. Don’t blame me for being ruthless if any of you choose to compete with me for it! You’ll die without a burial place.” A 2-meter tall hulking man growled with bloodshot eyes.</p><p>“3 billion dollars! Heh, do you think I’ll be afraid of you?”</p><p>A bald man abruptly got up overbearingly and shouted aloud.</p><p>The giant man’s expression greatly changed and a murderous aura crazily burst out from him as his figure instantly bolted away toward the auction platform and tried to grab the magic weapon.</p><p>Slash…</p><p>A sword beam suddenly appeared out of the blue and slashed the giant man’s body into halves in mid-air. The instant after, a large aquamarine net instantly appeared and enveloped the giant man’s remains and disappeared near the entrance to the auction floor.</p><p>Gasp…</p><p>All the guests attending the auction abruptly got up and gasped at this moment. Many of them knew who the giant man was. They knew how powerful he was, yet they didn’t expect that he would be killed instantly and none of them was able to see the person who did it.</p><p>Who could it be? Who has such a fearsome power?</p><p>All of a sudden, everyone felt a chill on their necks and fear inside their hearts. The fearsome strike had deterred them completely.</p><p>Tang Xiu slowly walked out of the other entrance. As he came to the auction platform and came to Higgert calmly, he lightly patted Higgert’s shoulder first and motioned him that he had nothing to worry about. Afterward, he grabbed the microphone and said, “Ladies and Gentlemen, I set up this Genesis Auction House to run a business. I don’t want anyone to make trouble here. Whoever dares to snatch any article other than obtaining it through legal transactions must prepare themselves to die!”</p><p>The moment after, Duanmu Lin stood in the first row of the seats. He floated up and then descended next to Tang Xiu. After nodding to Tang Xiu, he received the microphone and said, “Tang Xiu is right. This is China. Use your money if you want to get what you want. But if you just want to be a bandit and rob the auction articles, not only will you violate the laws of this country, but you will also face China’s Special Abilities Bureau!”</p><p>The guests exchanged dismayed glances with disbelief on their faces. They already knew that Tang Xiu was the owner of Genesis Auction House and it was understandable that he would come out in person after such an incident. But how did an official from China’s Special Abilities Bureau also come out?</p><p>Could it be that… the party behind this auction is China’s Special Abilities Bureau?</p><p>Many cultivators did intend to rob the items directly if they couldn’t buy the items they desired at first. But now it seemed like not only was there a mysterious expert holding the fort in the dark, there was also another entity—China’s Special Abilities Bureau. The latter alone was a force they couldn’t afford to provoke that easily, else they’d likely end up dying here.</p><p>The following events were carried out very smoothly. Except for the first two items which were sold at high prices, the latter auctioned items were just ordinary antiques and jewelry that were sold at reasonable prices. The auction proceedings for these items lasted until noon with a total of more than 80 articles.</p><p>At lunch.</p><p>The auction held by Genesis Auction House was quite peculiar and designed to appeal to affluent customers, while the Everlasting Feast Hall in Shanghai had too few chefs. Thus, quite a number of chefs had been temporarily transferred from Jingmen Island, Beijing, and Hong Kong to prepare the needed rich meals. Tang Xiu himself had ordered some people to deliver 200 boxes of God’s Nectar from the Magnificent Tang Corporation warehouse, all of which were served to all guests free of charge.</p><p>As the clock hit 2 PM and all these rich people had enough drinks and meals, the auction resumed. The first four articles auctioned in the afternoon session were still subjects of fierce biddings and were sold at sky-high prices. The first day of the auction was then concluded at 8 in the evening.</p><p>12 o’clock at night.</p><p>In the GM’s office on the third floor of the Genesis Auction House, when Andy, who was in charge of finance, arrived and reported the earning records, Tang Xiu, Hao Lei, Kang Xia, and even Ji Chimei looked at her with faces full of anticipation.</p><p>Andy slightly smiled and raised the account statement in her hand. She then said with a beaming face, “We’ve checked and calculated the data. A total of 180 articles have been sold today with total revenue of 46.832 billion US dollars.”</p><p>Tang Xiu slowly let out a breath of relief. Although he knew that the amount of money he made today was astronomical, he still felt a bit excited after he heard the specific number.</p><p>“I think the revenue we can obtain tomorrow won’t be as high, but it’s very likely that the last day of the auction two days later will definitely make us flabbergasted. I just can’t help but look forward to the total revenue earned after the conclusion of this three-day auction.</p><p>“Also, be it the Magnificent Tang Corporation or Grand Fortune Jewelry, both will need to stay low-profile afterward. However, all Tang Sect disciples must keep moving everywhere to purchase a lot of cultivation resources around the world.”</p><p>The third day passed.</p><p>The unprecedented auction held by Genesis Auction House that had become a sensation all over the world had finally concluded and all the guests who attended the auction participated in the biddings and bought hundreds of articles had all left.</p><p>The total revenue was 180 billion US dollars! Equal to over 1 trillion yuan.</p><p>The auction earned Tang Xiu a colossal amount of money and the days of being strapped for funds had finally come to an end.</p><p>****</p><p>Beijing, House Tang’s residence.</p><p>Tang Guosheng had issued an order to summon all members of House Tang to return to their ancestral house. Members of the house were coming one after another, and even Tang Yunpeng, who was in charge of major issues in the outside world, rushed back in a hurry.</p><p>“What exactly happened?”</p><p>Tang Yunpeng, who had a high position outside, unintentionally burst out an aura of someone in power even if he didn’t mean to when he asked Tang Min, who had just arrived. The latter only shook her head and said that she was also in the dark about it.</p><p>Suddenly, Tang Min said, “Anyway, it seems that Tang Xiu has arrived in Beijing about 2 hours ago. If my hunch is correct, he should be discussing some issues with Father now.”</p><p>Tang Yunpeng looked a bit surprised. After he entered the room with Tang Min, he saw his father, Tang Guosheng, sitting on the sofa with a complicated expression and apparently thinking about a complex issue, whereas his Second Uncle, Tang Guoxing, and Third Uncle, Tang Guoshou, looked excited instead, even though their fingers that clamped cigarettes were slightly trembling.</p><p>“First Uncle.” Tang Xiu got up and greeted respectfully.</p><p>Tang Yunpeng smiled in response. He walked to Tang Xiu and patted his shoulder, sighing. “I have been imagining to what extent you can reach many times, but now I understand that I still underestimated you. You earned over 1 trillion yuan from one auction. I don’t think even the total revenue of all banks in China in a year can compare to that.”</p><p>“Well, I also paid quite a lot for this auction, First Uncle.” Tang Xiu forced a smile.</p><p>“Power is the foundation of a clan, but wealth is a weapon of the family.” Tang Yunpeng nodded and went on, “House Tang is getting more powerful and even has faintly become the largest family in the whole China. It’s all mainly from your contribution.”</p><p>“I’m afraid that I’ll also become a variable for the decline of House Tang to become an ordinary family in China as well, Uncle.” Tang Xiu forced a smile yet again.</p><p>Tang Yunpeng furrowed his brows and asked, “What do you mean by that?”</p><p>Tang Guosheng sighed and waved to him as he forced a smile and said, “I’ll explain to you later, Yunpeng. I summoned everyone here due to some important things I need to announce.”</p><p>Tang Yunpeng looked doubtful and hesitated, then he walked to the door and called all the core members of House Tang into the room. All pairs of eyes then kept shifting from Tang Xiu to Tang Guosheng.</p><p>Tang Guosheng took a deep breath and said in a deep voice, “All core members of House Tang have arrived, so I’m now announcing one issue. All of you listen to me. Starting today, Tang Yunpeng will take over the Patriarch position of House Tang and he will be responsible and has the right to decide every affair in the family.”</p><p>“Father!”</p><p>Tang Yunpeng’s expression changed and he hurriedly called out. He quickly glanced over at his Second Uncle, Tang Guoxing, and Third Uncle, Tang Guoshou, only to find that they didn’t seem to care about it, as though they had learned about the issue in advance.</p><p>“Yunpeng, I’m already old and it’s just time to hand over the responsibility and rights over the family, so don’t blame your father for making this decision.” Tang Guosheng spoke, “Our family needs you to manage it on your shoulder alone. You can pick out a successor after you carry out the job for 10 years before you can relax afterward.”</p><p>“But this really baffles me, father.” Tang Yunpeng frowned and said, “I can’t blame you on anything even if I take over your position as the Head of the family, right? Isn’t this supposed to be a happy event that I should feel happy about?”</p><p>Tang Guosheng shook his head with a forced smile and then spoke again, “Then, I declare my last order as the Head of Tang Family. Aside from Yunpeng, the other core members of House Tang will have to relinquish their official positions in the government or other business affairs. Arrange the matter with the government well, whereas the business side will be handed over to the Magnificent Tang Corporation under Kang Xia’s management.”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“What’s going on?”</p><p>“This…”</p><p>Each and every member of the Tang Family was stunned and looked at Tang Guosheng in disbelief. It seemed like this order shocked them the most.</p><p>Leaving their position, handing over their authority as well as their businesses?</p><p>What kind of huge accident happened in the Tang Family, exactly? Else, how could it…</p><p>“I give you all seven days to deal with all your issues.” Tang Guosheng went on in a deep voice. “A week later, all core members of House Tang will leave Beijing and China. I believe you all know about Nine Dragons Island Xiu’er has bought before. That will be the place where all core members of our family will migrate to. Our family will no longer be involved in worldly affairs anymore starting from now on aside from Yunpeng alone. Every one of you will focus all your energy to practice martial arts and cultivation!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
