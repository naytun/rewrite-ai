They didn’t expect that the terrifying expert in front of them would make such a request.</p><p>Could it be that he had a grudge towards his own disciple? Why did he force them to go all out to kill his disciple?</p><p>Tang Ahlang swiftly cast a technique and unleashed the immortal sword stored in his body towards the two young men instantly. He realized that his Master’s order meant that he must kill these two people, or he would be killed by them today. This order was both a way to hone himself as well as a trial for him.</p><p>“Kill…”</p><p>The two young men no longer hesitated. The desire to survive became a trigger and drive to go berserk. They weren’t saints. Their hands were stained by blood. Even their Master ended up like a dead stray dog in the hands of this man. Hence, the only chance for the two of them to survive was to kill this young man, hoping that this youth’s Master would keep his word.</p><p>“Lightning Rune!”</p><p>In nearly a flash, they took out two paper runes from their sleeves and activated it, hurling lightning bolts directly at Tang Ahlang.</p><p>Standing more than 10 meters away, Tang Xiu’s eyes instantly narrowed. He noticed that the lightning runes activated by these two youths were unexpectedly paper runes he refined himself and were auctioned out at the Genesis Auction House three years ago.</p><p>“Interesting.”</p><p>A smile crept up on the corner of Tang Xiu’s mouth as he observed the two youths who were full of desire to kill.</p><p>Tang Ahlang had never had a life-and-death fight with cultivators and was shocked when facing dozens of hurling lightning bolts that sealed off all the space around him. Even if he were to quickly retreat, his speed wouldn’t be able to beat the speed of the lightning bolts.</p><p>“Decagon Killing Sword!”</p><p>Tang Ahlang steeled his heart and instantly manipulated his immortal sword and formed 10-sword-beam formation. His body shook violently when the lightning bolts bombarded the sword beams array, causing him to take a few steps back before he was able to stabilize himself.</p><p><em>Creak, creak…</em></p><p>The two youth’s figures began to change at the moment, revealing a pair of fangs and sharp nails. At the same time, a pair of wings instantly grew on their backs. The moment they flapped their wings, two streams of black energy turned into sharp arrows and hurled toward Tang Ahlang lightning-fast.</p><p><em>They are vampires?!</em></p><p>Tang Ahlang had never seen a real vampire before. He only heard that this race existed in some European countries. He even heard that some vampires had a deep friendship with his Master.</p><p>“Psychic Wave!”</p><p>Lacking combat experience, Tang Ahlang used offensive moves like a defensive one to block the series of lightning bombardments and resisted the incoming dark energy arrow. At the same time, he also exhibited another type of strike that he was good at.</p><p><em>Buzz…</em></p><p>The two vampires attacking Tang Ahlang suddenly trembled and let out shrieking screams, causing their dark energy arrows to disperse.</p><p>Meanwhile, Tang Ahlang’s figure lunged and streaked up into the air tens of meters high like a cannonball. He then unleashed the Decagonal Sword Array move once again. This time, he used the move not to defend but to take the initiative to launch a strike.</p><p><em>Slash, slash, slash…</em></p><p>Bloodstains appeared on the two vampire’s bodies. But both of them had rich combat experience and quickly brandished their staffs to form a huge shield with their dark energy, blocking the incoming sword beams. At the same time, they also continuously released dark energy arrows at Tang Ahlang from both sides. The bizarre trajectory of the arrows caught Tang Ahlang off guard, causing the dark arrows to explode as they hit his chest.</p><p><em>Puah…</em></p><p>Coughing up a mouthful of blood, the jade pendant on Tang Ahlang’s chest shattered and eventually turned into dust, dispersing in the wind.</p><p>“F*ck! Off!”</p><p>The immortal sword flew back to Tang Ahlang in a flash. The sword beams it created blitzed like lightning bolts, dispersing the dark energy arrows. However, the moment he was off guard yet again, two sharp feathers followed the next incoming countless dark energy arrows and straightly hit his left arm and right chest.</p><p><em>I gotta calm down and keep my head cool! My combat experience is not as rich as theirs, but I’m faster and stronger than them. If I can observe their moves with a cool head, I can definitely find the flaws in their attacks and then launch a counterattack.</em></p><p>Although he was injured, he forced himself to calm down. His eyes turned sharper. As his trembling body stabilized, he used his spiritual sense to launch another psychic wave attack, causing the two vampires to scream and flee.</p><p>“Flame…”</p><p>Casting another technique, Tang Ahlang conjured flames out of thin air and then turned it into a fire rain. The overwhelming attack blotted out the sky and oppressively crushed towards the two vampires.</p><p>“Wind…”</p><p>A rolling twister appeared around the flame out of nowhere and formed a flaming twister as though a ring of fire halo around the sun, causing the speed of the flames to increase by several folds.</p><p>“Blade…”</p><p>The moment his immortal sword hovered and surrounded Tang Ahlang’s body and destroyed the barrage of dark energy arrows coming at him, a sharp dagger suddenly appeared in his hand. It was a dagger—a self-protection type dagger given by Master’s lady, Kang Xia, who personally picked it up in the Nine Dragons Island’s treasure vault.</p><p>“I’ve never killed anyone, but I’ve slain hundreds of fierce beasts. Now that you’ve turned into beasts, then I’ll reap your lives!”</p><p>He had the advantage in speed and quickly pursued along with the rain of fire twister, appearing in front one of the vampires in a flash. As he launched a meteor-like punch into the rain of fire twister, the violent punch was magnified dozens of times and bombarded the vampire. He quickly bolted forward with the dagger in hand and pierced one of the vampire’s wings the moment the latter was forced to retreat.</p><p>“BURN!”</p><p>A flame blob suddenly appeared on the vampire’s wounded wing. In nearly a flash, the flame blazed and swept across the whole wing.</p><p>“Aaargh…”</p><p>The extreme pain caused the vampire to shriek and scream miserably, but the response that greeted him next was meteoric sword beams that pierced his body.</p><p>“BROTHER!!!”</p><p>The other vampire never dreamed that his big brother would be pierced by their opponent in such a fashion so quickly. Although he knew that the Bloodkin had abnormally strong bodies and wouldn’t die as long as their Core Nucleus wasn’t destroyed, his brother’s miserable state caused him to nearly lose his mind.</p><p>“Feather…”</p><p>He flapped his wings and a band of feathers instantly shot forward. With the speed doubled and with the addition of the dark energy arrows, they appeared in front of Tang Ahlang in the blink of an eye.</p><p>Life and death had never been so close as in this moment.</p><p>Tang Ahlang could even sense the impending shadow of death looming over his head. Unfortunately for his opponent, he didn’t panic because he knew that he would be closer to death if he lost his calm. While watching the incoming dark energy arrows and feathers resolutely, his fingers constantly moved as he cast a secret art. In the next moment, the fire twister all over the sky instantly condensed and formed a flaming sword covered by twister flame.</p><p>It was a magical skill he created himself after enlightenment fighting the fierce beasts in the pocket world. The flame sword flashed and cut the vampire’s body. The moment it slashed the vampire’s body, the speed of the feathers that filled the sky sharply dropped by several folds.</p><p>“Block!”</p><p>The instant after, he instantly manipulated his True Essence energy to form a transparent shield in front of him and then coughed a mouthful of blood. His body flew backward and fell to the ground. If it wasn’t for his tough body after having undergone tempering, he would have turned into a meat pulp from the heavy fall.</p><p>“Hmph…”</p><p>Tang Xiu, standing in the courtyard, saw the vampire with one wing destroyed not even care about his brother’s death and flee when Tang Ahlang fell. He immediately threw a dagger and directly crushed the Core Nucleus in his body.</p><p>Afterward, Tang Xiu appeared in front of Tang Ahlang and lifted him from the ground. While looking at Tang Ahlang’s scarred state with a disappointed expression, he shook his head and said, “You would have died if that fleeing vampire chose to launch a powerful attack against you. You failed this trial. I want you to work more diligently later and not let me see another defeat.”</p><p><em>Cough, cough…</em></p><p>Tang Ahlang coughed up two mouthfuls of blood. He suppressed the violent and chaotic energy inside his body and replied with a depressed face, “I’ll keep it in mind, Master. I’ll definitely work harder to temper myself and increase my combat experience.”</p><p>Tang Xiu nodded in response and took out a Holy Healing pill. He stuffed it into Tang Ahlang’s mouth and said, “You have half an hour to recuperate, then we’ll continue our trip. I’ll give you other chances to fight in the next two months, from which you must learn how to survive. As long as you survive, you’ll be able to adapt to the bloody storm when we arrive in the Immortal World in the future.”</p><p>A firm and resolute look filled Tang Ahlang’s eyes. He knew that his Master was disappointed in him this time. Given his current cultivation level, he should’ve been able to kill the two vampires with ease.</p><p>After half an hour, Tang Ahlang jumped up from the ground and respectfully said, “My injury has mostly healed, Master.”</p><p>Tang Xiu nodded and ordered. “You have another half-hour to recall and reflect on the previous fight. I want you to give me at least three ways to easily kill the two vampires half an hour later.”</p><p>Tang Ahlang then sat cross-legged on the ground. His expression turned thoughtful and his eyes kept flickering.</p><p>He recollected the fight bit by bit and analyzed it again and again.</p><p>Finally, the first method that could easily kill those two vampires took shape in his mind and a look of shame appeared on his delicate face.</p><p>A few minutes later, he was able to deduce the second method.</p><p>15 minutes later, he deduced the third method, but he didn’t stop his analysis and continued to deduce more. His analysis speed turned faster as time passed. In just half an hour, he had come up with 11 methods to easily kill the two vampires. An ashamed expression then covered his face as he lifted his head to look at Tang Xiu.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
