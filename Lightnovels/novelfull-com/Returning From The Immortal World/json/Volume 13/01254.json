These people came from all races and various countries with different cultivation systems.</p><p>Is this still killing and exterminating the Dark Shaman Clan? How come we must fight against these people for no reason? Could it be that… these people are all foreign aids from the Dark Shaman Clan? But these people don’t look like they are cultivators, nor are they subordinates of that young man surnamed Tang from China, do they?</p><p>However, after fighting for 10 minutes, the experts from Celestial Wizard Clan noticed that most of these people only had average strength even though their number nearly reached 10,000 people. The strongest among them was probably at the Spirit Formation Stage and there were only two people comparable to the Nascent Soul Stage. It was still a chasm of comparison compared to the quality of the Celestial Wizard Clan’s ranks.</p><p>We can kill to our hearts’ contents here!</p><p>The elders and experts of Celestial Wizard Clan similarly had this idea and thus went all out when unleashing their power. Constantly conjuring magical wizardry art, they kept mowing and killing members of Sacred Flame Organization.</p><p>“Kill them all and the 10 billion dollars are ours!”</p><p>Vulcan was also aware of the gap of strength between two sides, but he didn’t care about it. First of all, he had the advantage in number, which was more than 10 times that of the enemy. Even if they were to lose a number of people, he could still gather as many experts with 10 billion dollars.</p><p>Money is paramount—that was the one and only creed of Sacred Flame.</p><p>Men would die for fortune as beasts would for food. For the sake of obtaining the 10 billion dollars reward, all members of Sacred Flame turned into a frenzy, many of whom had the idea to perish with the enemy. Thus, they forced the enemies to keep retreating and inflicted heavy damage and killed many of them.</p><p>At this moment, the Sacred Flame side seized the initiative with their current momentum and gained the upper hand. The fight between two sides escalated into a frenzied and frantic battle. Human life was just worthless at this moment, and the blood of those who still lived boiled, eyes turned bloodshot and incited their primal savageness.</p><p>****</p><p>On the fifth island.</p><p>Tang Xiu sat quietly in a garden house while watching the surveillance video on the display that gave him a clear situation of the ongoing battle on the fourth island. What made him feel relieved was that Singluen and some experts of Dark Shaman Clan he led there didn’t directly join the battle and hid in the distance while observing the killing scene via a high-powered telescope.</p><p>“The Celestial Wizard Clan will suffer heavy blows on the fourth island, it seems.”</p><p>Standing behind Tang Xiu, Tang Guang commented and a smile climbed up on his handsome face.</p><p>Tang Xiu glanced at him and lightly replied, “Don’t jump to conclusions before things are clear. There still are variables you need to analyze even if you make any speculations. The present battle situation where the Sacred Flame has at least 10,000 experts, they may bring great damage to the Celestial Wizard Clan if they do fight with all their strength. But do you think this bunch of motley crews whose creed ‘money is supreme’ really have what it takes to contend with the highly-united Celestial Wizard Clan?”</p><p>“But even ants can kill elephants with their numbers, Grand Master,” Tang Guang argued. “The Sacred Flame has more experts, at least 10 times greater than that of the Celestial Wizard Clan. With such an advantage in numbers, even if they are defeated, the Celestial Wizard Clan wouldn’t have it better either, right?”</p><p>“Striking power is indeed very important in the war, but momentum on the battlefield is just as important,” Tang Xiu explained. “Members of the Sacred Flame are now fighting with full strength due to being stimulated by money. But as their losses get worse and worse, they will never take money into account again. They are also a rational bunch and understand that it’s worthless to have so much money if they die. With such a thought in mind, their momentum will gradually decline. By then, only death will await them.”</p><p>Tang Guang gave it a thought for a while and felt that Tang Xiu’s reasonings were sound. However, he wore a puzzled expression and asked, “Why do I feel that you have some kind of resentment towards these Sacred Flame people, Grand Master? They obviously are our ally in this cooperation, but why don’t you order us to get into action?”</p><p>“Hmph, they are the culprits who abducted Chen Zhizhong.” Tang Xiu sneered. “What they believe is money. They will work and serve whoever gives them money, and the one who hired them to abduct Chen Zhizhong is the Celestial Wizard Clan. I already spent 15 billion dollars to hire them to kill these Celestial Wizard Clan’s people. It’s just a business deal, so why can’t I make them be cannon fodder at this time to kill some Celestial Wizard Clan’s experts for us?”</p><p>Cannon fodder?</p><p>Everyone present was touched, especially Chen Zhizhong, who also stood behind in the crowd. Prior to this, he didn’t understand why his Master Tang Xiu would hire Sacred Flame’s people. After all, the culprits who severely injured and abducted him until he was detained here were the same bunch of people.</p><p>He now realized that his Master Tang Xiu carried out revenge for him! Further, it was a machination that would kill two birds with one stone.</p><p>Time fleeted by and half an hour passed in the blink of an eye. The brutal killings inflicted huge losses on both sides. Even though Vulcan with the Sacred Flame’s members he led faintly had the upper hand, all the disciples of Tang Sect just kept watching the dozens of surveillance footage intently. There was not the slight sympathy in their eyes and instead, wishing that the battle of the two sides became more intense.</p><p>Suddenly, Tang Guang pointed at one of the surveillance screens and called out, “These bunches of Sacred Flame are gonna be unlucky. The Celestial Wizard Clan seems to be going all out now! You guys take a look at them. Some hundreds of their experts are catching up and they’re quite… fast!”</p><p>Tang Xiu shifted to the said surveillance screen and saw hundreds of experts of the Celestial Wizard Clan led by a hulking man storming over lightning-fast towards the battlefield. Their speed was indeed very fast. After some estimation, Tang Xiu judged that some of these experts should be at least comparable to Nascent Soul Stage cultivators. Suddenly, his focus shifted and his countenance turned more serious. There were two figures that moved much faster than those Nascent Soul Stage experts, overtaking the hundreds of people and the first to arrive on the battlefield.</p><p>Further, each of their strikes brought fearsome might and the joint attack of these two figures killed tens of Sacred Flame’s experts in the blink of an eye.</p><p>“Spirit Formation Stage! These two are at least comparable to the Spirit Formation Stage. This Celestial Wizard Clan seems to have deeper heritage than we think.” At present, Tang Guang, who had broken through the Spirit Formation Stage, muttered with a grim face.</p><p>Tang Xiu nodded in response and added, “That’s right. They’re indeed experts at Spirit Formation Stage. Further, that black-robed old fogy should be comparable with a Spirit Formation late-stage expert. If anything, this is quite interesting, though. Them coming out in a full swing just saved us some time to storm their nest to obliterate them.”</p><p>Having said that, Tang Xiu shifted to Mo Awu next to him and ordered in a deep voice, “Contact Singluen and tell him to return immediately with the experts of Dark Shaman Clan! These hundreds of experts from Celestial Wizard Clan have joined the fray, so Singluen’s group won’t affect the situation even if they join the battle.”</p><p>“But Grand Master, the Sacred Flame may suffer heavy losses with these hundreds of Celestial Wizard Clan’s experts enter the battlefield, right?” Tang Guang hesitantly said, “You see, they’re now losing the momentum and many of them even began to flee.”</p><p>“No worries!” Tang Xiu lightly smiled and said, “The battle won’t be over that easily. Although the Sacred Flame lost over 1,000 people since the battle began, the Celestial Wizard Clan also lost more than 200 people. Even if the members of Sacred Flame flee, the Celestial Wizard Clan’s people will also be in hot pursuit to hunt them. Hence, the battle on the fourth island won’t end within 2 hours.”</p><p>As expected, the battle on the fourth island didn’t stem beyond Tang Xiu’s estimation. Even though the experts of Sacred Flame Organization kept retreating, they were still entangled by the experts from Celestial Wizard Clan. The two sides fought again for more than 3 hours, and only less than 4,000 Sacred Flame’s experts were left behind, whereas the rest of them fled to the fifth island with a lot of scars.</p><p>“Boss!”</p><p>Singluen rushed to the monitoring room with his five Guardian Elders.</p><p>Tang Xiu turned to him. After seeing that Singluen didn’t have any scars, he smilingly said, “Well done. Some of you have used wizardry arts and those members of Celestial Wizard Clan will soon find out about it. It won’t take long for them to give chase. Well, the good thing is, those ragtags from the Sacred Flame didn’t escape to the sixth island as previously planned but fled toward our fifth island, though.”</p><p>Singluen stared blankly and wondered. “If they are escaping to our position, will it make the Celestial Wizard Clan be on guard?”</p><p>“I don’t think so.” Tang Xiu sneered. “The more profound the heritage of the clan, the more conceited they will be. The Celestial Wizard Clan lost so many people; they will never give up. Just wait here. The Celestial Wizard Clan will definitely storm over here after recovering and making some adjustments.”</p><p>Having said that, Tang Xiu got up and issued an order in a deep voice. “Head to the seashore to greet those Sacred Flame’s bunch. Once they land on the island, immediately place them on the defense net with us. Their role as cannon fodder is over, but they still have to take part in the battle.”</p><p>“Umm, you’ve planned all this previously, haven’t you, Sect Master?” Chi Nan suddenly asked.</p><p>“A man of brains can see it through, but don’t bother to say it, you know.” Tang Xiu smilingly replied.</p><p>It took only a flash for not only Chi Nan to realize it, but also all the experts of Tang Sect in the room. They finally realized that even if anyone wanted to get to the sixth island as quickly as possible, they still had to pass by the fifth island first. Further, there was still also the concern of the enemy pursuit who chased them to the sixth island once they arrived there. Thus, it would be better to head straight to the fifth island and join the Tang Sect members to face the Celestial Wizard Clan since the odds of winning would also be greater.</p><p>No one can compare to Sect Master in machinations and schemes, indeed.</p><p>At the moment, the same thought filled the minds of all the Tang Sect’s disciples in the room. However, recalling that the bereaved dogs of Sacred Flame would soon flee to their positions, they quickly rushed outside and informed the others to be ready for battle at any time.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
