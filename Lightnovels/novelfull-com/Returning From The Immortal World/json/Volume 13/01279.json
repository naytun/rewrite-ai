He was well aware of the strength of his second brother. Yet, that young man killed him in just one blow. It was obvious that this fellow’s strength was extremely terrifying and definitely someone he couldn’t afford to contend with.</p><p>“RUN!”</p><p>Without any care about the body of his second brother, the man instantly cast a secret technique that caused his speed to multiply several times as he fled lightning-fast.</p><p>Tang Xiu chuckled coldly and cast a secret technique. The gray-haired man felt that his waist was bound with a stream of energy that pulled him backward. He couldn’t break free no matter how hard he tried.</p><p>“Cage containment!”</p><p>Tang Xiu moved his fingers and instantly drew some array patterns. In a flash, an array had fully covered an area with a range of one kilometer that contained the grey-haired man and the three men within. Afterward, he smiled and said, “You’ll never be able to break this array. The only way for you to survive is to kill my disciple. But if you can’t kill him, then it will be you who’ll be killed, of course.”</p><p>Getting shot with the same old tricks one after another did give a very significant effect. The four men suppressed their fears after hearing Tang Xiu’s statement and directly stormed over Tang Ahlang to kill him. Their speed was very fast and the might they unleashed was very powerful. Coupled with their teamwork and the area of movements that was limited to a radius of 1,000 meters, Tang Ahlang finally faced a thrilling and perilous fight that nearly killed him several times.</p><p>At first, Tang Ahlang could only keep avoiding desperately before he gradually adapted to the rhythm of the encirclement attacks. His mind was even able to calculate faster and faster and then he began to fight back. Although the might of his counterattacks was insignificant at the beginning, it continued to increase. In just 10 minutes, he fully adapted to the battle rhythm and began to suppress the four people without them being able to fight back.</p><p>“It should end soon, huh?”</p><p>After seeing up to this moment, Tang Xiu was already very satisfied.</p><p>“DIE!”</p><p>The immortal sword controlled by Tang Ahlang suddenly blasted out. It was like the sun had exploded in front of the four people. Immediately after, the four men’s pupils shrunk and they could only watch as sword beams shot at their eyes. None of them were able to avoid the strikes no matter how desperately they tried.</p><p><em>Puff! Puff! Puff! Puff!</em></p><p>Four bodies fell along with their decapitated heads.</p><p>After beheading these four people, Tang Ahlang wiped off the bloodstain on his face and released his True essence energy to shake off the blood that covered nearly all his clothes. Afterward, he cast a water-based immortal technique, washed his body directly, took out some clothes from his interspatial ring, and stuffed the older ones after he got changed hurriedly.</p><p>“Master!”</p><p>Tang Ahlang dashed to Tang Xiu’s front and raised his hand to touch the striking wound on his left cheek. His smile at this time, however, was particularly bright.</p><p>“Your combat skills have improved rapidly. Your ability to adapt to the situation in battle is remarkable.” Tang Xiu nodded with satisfaction. “However, it’s still far from enough, so I’ll take you to other places in the next few days. You’ll have to go through such fights again before you can carry out your next mission.”</p><p>“Ehh? You have some missions ready for me to carry out, Master?” Tang Ahlang curiously asked.</p><p>“You can expect that the duty I’m going to give will be a very heavy one.” Tang Xiu nodded and said, “This duty will put the life and death of tens of thousands of people on your shoulder. Therefore, the most important aspect you need to improve as of now is your combat experience and the taste of life-and-death atmosphere on the battlefield. Keep this in mind. Even though I count this as your task to carry out, this also serves as a golden opportunity for you. Grasp it well and make me satisfied with your performance since this will benefit you greatly.”</p><p>“Understood!” Tang Ahlang nodded, and his expression turned extremely resolute.</p><p>****</p><p>In the following days, Tang Xiu took Tang Ahlang to various Asian countries. Through the Great Tang Empire’s intel network, he found other five places occupied by evil cultivators. After the series of battles and much tempering and honing, Tang Ahlang’s fast transformation gave Tang Xiu quite a surprise.</p><p>In these several days, the jade pendant he gave Tang Ahlang had warded him from fatal injuries twice. It was still hanging on Tang Ahlang’s waist although there were a few more cracks on it.</p><p>At the basin of a mountain valley.</p><p>Tang Ahlang was standing atop a mound of flesh and blood. Bodies were seen everywhere in the surroundings. He wiped the blood on his face and his eyes still contained a bit of killing intent. His head then titled up as he came to Tang Xiu and asked, “Where shall we go next, Master?”</p><p>“It’s enough. We should go back now.” Tang Xiu shook his head.</p><p>Tang Ahlang spaced out for a moment before his tense expression relaxed. The murderous intent in his eyes gradually dissipated. After washing himself using a magic spell, he changed his clothes, took a Holy Healing pill, and then respectfully said, “I think I’ve fully adapted to the atmosphere on the battlefield after fighting these tens of days. Aside from improving my combat experience, only now do I realize that I used to be like a guardian of a gold mountain, but I still couldn’t get enough meals since I had no idea how to utilize that gold mountain to buy food.”</p><p>“Well, you’ve stimulated your potential. I can say that your initial transformation has been completed in just several days.” Tang Xiu lightly smiled in response and said, “All things considered, you’ve done well, and this will be greatly beneficial for you in the future. However, don’t become arrogant and complacent. You should now be well aware of the fact that you could’ve died several times already had it not been for the protective talisman I gave you. That’s why you must keep in mind to never treat enemies lightly in the future, no matter who they are. Plan carefully and unleash everything you have to strike any enemies you face regardless of their strength and cultivation levels.”</p><p>“I understand, Master.” Tang Ahlang respectfully nodded.</p><p>During these 10 days or so, all major forces throughout the Asian region had shrunk. The emergence of a mysterious assassin had become public knowledge. This person boasted a very powerful strength, so powerful that they were scared senseless.</p><p>Further, the tragic and miserable situation of those who were hit was also passed to the leaders of all forces. After reading the information, all of them remained silent for a long time and chose to stay dormant. No one tried to investigate the identity of this mysterious grim reaper. It wasn’t that they didn’t have the intention to kill this person, but rather that they didn’t have the guts to.</p><p>Their fear was so great that they even chose to ally and stay together for fear that this Grim Reaper would strike them.</p><p>****</p><p>On Nine Dragons Island.</p><p>The first thing Tang Xiu did when he returned to Nine Dragons Island was to issue an order. The four major army corps were to be dispatched collectively and each army would infiltrate some regions, respectively the four regions occupied by four targets: The Pyramid, League of Archcrusaders, Stygian Club, and House Dolan.</p><p>****</p><p>Half a month later.</p><p>Las Vegas in the United States was the biggest city in Nevada, internationally famous for its reputation as a gambling city. Here, the gambling industry was the core in tourism, shopping, and vacation that comprised an integral whole of the famous city. All of which earned the city the fanciful moniker of “The World’s Entertainment City” as well as “the Wedding Capital of the World”.</p><p>Santa Emperador Casino.</p><p>Touted as the largest and most luxurious casino in Las Vegas, the casino was patronized by more than tens of thousands of guests from all over the world every day. Some people got rich overnight and others ended up penniless.</p><p>In the VIP room on the third floor.</p><p>Thick beads of sweat appeared on Du Chengfeng’s forehead. His complexion paled as he looked at the less than 20-years-old youth in front of him with incredulity. On both sides of the gambling stakes, a white man and a big black man looked at the smiling, boyish-looking youth with horrified eyes.</p><p>“You guys know that those who owe money must pay interest! Each of you owes 4.8 billion dollars. Leave your fucking life here if you got no money to pay it.” Tang Ahlang took out a cigarette and lit it, taking a deep puff and stating with a smile.</p><p>“You must be cheating, punk!”</p><p>The burly black man abruptly got up, yelling and glaring furiously at Tang Ahlang.</p><p>The white man followed suit and angrily shouted, “That’s right! You gotta be fucking cheating! Else it’s impossible for you to have those cards! Oriental punk, do you know how grave the consequences are for cheating in front of me, Asda?”</p><p>Tang Ahlang looked disappointed and shook his head. “You both don’t wanna pay given your attitude, huh! If I recall correctly, those who don’t pay their debts here will be taken care of by the Boss of this place even if I don’t kill you. What say you? Do you really refuse to pay for your lives and choose to die here?”</p><p>The white man turned to look at a certain middle-aged man and shouted sternly, “Manager Phillip, I want a guarantee from your casino. This punk must be cheating. I want him to be punished!”</p><p>Near the gambling table, an old-fashioned middle-aged man wearing gold-rimmed glasses slowly shook his head and said, “He didn’t cheat. We have 16 surveillance cameras in this VIP room, along with 16 casino staff. Even the dealer himself didn’t find him cheating. All in all, you both have lost today, so you will have to pay, though 4.8 billion dollars is not a small sum.”</p><p>“Did you guys hear?” Tang Ahlang laughed and said, “Those who gamble must be ready to lose. You lost, so you gotta pay. You know, I’m one who likes to socialize. I also love money and never like to kill. You can leave after each of you pays me 4.8 billion dollars. Else, not only will you die, but even your buddies and families will also bite the dust.”</p><p>Despair filled Du Chengfeng’s eyes. He took his handkerchief, wiped off the sweat on his face and bitterly said, “Little Bro, you know the saying not to invite calamity to your family, yes? Today, Du Chengfeng admits that I don’t have much money. I can only come up with 300 million dollars at most. If you must kill someone, just kill me, but leave my family out of this.”</p><p>“KILL HIM!”</p><p>“YOU’RE DEAD!”</p><p>The burly white man and the black man pulled out the pistols from their waists at the same time. The eight bodyguards they brought also followed suit and aimed their guns at Tang Ahlang, ready to shoot.</p><p><em>Bang, bang, bang…</em></p><p>A series of gunfire sounded, and the white man and black man suddenly fell into a pool of their own blood at the same time. Their eight bodyguards were all also ruthlessly murdered by the ten security guards of the casino.</p><p>Du Chengfeng’s two bodyguards also pulled out their pistols, but they didn’t pull the trigger and just stood on both sides of Du Chengfeng, looking vigilant and ready to face any attack.</p><p>“Little Brother…”</p><p>Du Chengfeng’s lips squirmed a few times before he finally shouted in Chinese. He felt that using the language could be the last straw that could save his life because he suspected that Tang Ahlang was a Chinese national.</p><p>This was also his last gamble. He might be able to save his poor life if he bet a correct one, but if he was wrong, he knew that he would really bite the dust here today.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
