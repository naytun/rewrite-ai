What he needed to do now was wait for the news. If William could take out 800 million yuan, then the Longs wouldn’t pick up trouble with them anymore, at least on the surface. However, the machinations that had been set up for them would bring up more troubles for these people.</p><p>As dusk came, William personally contacted Tang Xiu and asked his accompany to the Imperial Dragon Villa. After the 800 million yuan had been transferred to Long Hanwen’s account, the latter made a call to let Cal Solund go.</p><p>“Shall we stay and have dinner together, Uncle Long?” Tang Xiu smiled and looked at Long Hanwen.</p><p>“How can I dine with this guy in my place when my son is still lying in the hospital now?” replied Long Hanwen coldly. “And you, Tang Xiu. You’re a good Big Boss. You had better avoid to have any dealings with the Harbo Group in the future. Be wary and careful towards these cruel and ruthless people for they will bite you sooner or later.”</p><p>“Ugh…”</p><p>Tang Xiu’s smile immediately froze and he glanced fast at the awkward-looking William. He then yawned and hurriedly said, “Well, we’ll disturb you no longer since you’re busy, Uncle Long. But shortly put, I’d like to thank you for your time as well as giving me face.”</p><p>Immediately after, he and William left the Long Family’s manor awkwardly. William then spoke to him with an apologetic look, “I need to apologize to you again, Boss Tang. I shouldn’t have misunderstood you before. Now that we’ve settled this problem… could you… consider the cooperation between my company and yours? You know, we came to China and Star City in good faith and goodwill, wishing to cooperate with your Magnificent Tang Corporation so we can earn massive fortune together.”</p><p>Tang Xiu waved and said, “Apology accepted, but I chose not to cooperate with your Harbo Group. I may not a big man myself, but my words still have weight and I still have the integrity to uphold as well. My company has issued that announcement. If I were to take it back, wouldn’t it mean that my company has no credibility? If I were really to take this move, which major company around the world would dare to cooperate with my company again later?”</p><p>William was silent for a while and then replied with a bleak expression, “I’ll no longer pester Boss Tang about this matter since you’ve made up your mind. I just hope that you can consider providing a chance of cooperation with Harbo Group in other businesses in the future.”</p><p>“Alright!” Tang Xiu nodded.</p><p>An hour later, William took more than 10 of his men and quickly returned to the Long’s Dining Hall. But as just as he strode into the site’s entrance, he saw many people jam-packed in the lobby on the first floor.</p><p>“Take a look at what happened!”</p><p>Being in a foul mood, he didn’t want to stay in the lobby and issued the order. As the Director of China’s Harbo Group, he had made disappointing errors which led to the announcement from the Magnificent Tang Corp. that they would never cooperate with his company—a failure which became his main responsibility alone.</p><p>“Make way!”</p><p>The subordinates William just sent squeezed into the crowd and shouted loudly at the crowd around. His voice made William, who was about to leave, halt his pace abruptly.</p><p>Shortly after, William’s face was flushed red. What he saw there was Cal Solund lying on the floor like a dead dog. His condition was too horrible to look at, causing William to wish he could find any crack to drill in at once.</p><p>This was really shameful—a total disgrace!</p><p>Cal Solund’s condition was so horrible with the tendons of his feet and arms cut off and two of his front teeth gone. He wouldn’t have been able to recognize him immediately if he wasn’t familiar with him. But the most conspicuous and important thing was, Cal Solund’s upper body was naked and red characters were written on his chest: He who insults others must be humiliated.</p><p>“Take him!”</p><p>William didn’t want to stay here even a second longer and shouted loudly with a grim face. He turned and strode towards the elevator quickly. He didn’t notice that some dressy and foppish young men in suits were fixedly staring at him with sinister eyes.</p><p>****</p><p>At the Magnificent Tang Corp.</p><p>The moment Tang Xiu returned, he immediately ordered some people to publicize what happened today. In just less than 2 hours, the heads of companies all over the world heard about today’s matter. The announcement made everyone admire Tang Xiu, and even many of these companies decided that the cooperation with Magnificent Tang Corp. was a priority.</p><p>In the spacious and bright GM’s office, as Tang Xiu sat on the soft couch while Kang Xia was about to serve a cup of hot tea for him, a figure suddenly appeared in front of Tang Xiu out of the blue.</p><p>“News just came from the U.S., Grand Master.”</p><p>“What is it about?” asked Tang Xiu.</p><p>“It’s about the three companies, Cupid, Dandelion and Sava Groups. We’ve already investigated the details of their owners. Cupid is deeply related to a certain U.S. politician who’s its biggest shareholder, whereas the Big Boss behind Dandelion is a man with considerable status in the Stygian Club. Even some Stygian Club experts have been protecting the representative of the Dandelion Group who came to China. The Sava Group’s details are rather complicated, but we have determined that two of its shareholders are deeply related to the Pyramid.”</p><p>Tang Xiu squinted and sneered. “Heh, what deep backgrounds they have. Let these dogs fight with their own kind. An, secretly assassinate the experts of Dandelion company and strike some of the Harbo ones. Mix their bodies together to make it like they’re fighting each other. Then, make it so that the directors of these two companies appear at the same time.”</p><p>“Only targeting Dandelion?” asked Tang An to confirm the order.</p><p>“The assassination is only for the Dandelion, but you are to assault some from the Cupid and Sava in secret. Leave them at the Long Family’s Imperial Dragon Manor. We’ll wait for the next development and watch the show afterward.” Tang Xiu went on.</p><p>“Understood!”</p><p>Tang An replied and then vanished.</p><p>Kang Xia brought the hot tea and came to Tang Xiu’s front. After looking around, a forced wry smile appeared on her beautiful face as she hesitantly spoke, “I’m kind of feeling uncomfortable, Boss.”</p><p>“What makes you feel so?” asked Tang Xiu with a puzzled face.</p><p>“You always have such a mysterious person around you that I can’t even notice. Someone keeps appearing out of the blue in front of you. If it keeps going on like this, I won’t dare to be intimate with you again later for fear, that someone suddenly appeared and just watched us when we… are… doing things…”</p><p>Tang Xiu was stunned and immediately wore a strange expression. He understood who this “person and someone” Kang Xia just mentioned was. He neglected this issue and couldn’t realize it prior to this, but her reminder made him realize that it was rather improper to have Tang An keep hiding in the dark following him all the time.</p><p>It must be noted that he had many women. If he were to have some “activities” with them and Tang An was around. In that case…</p><p>The thought sent a chill run down his back. He reached out to pull Kang Xia over and gently hugged her. “It’s indeed my negligence. But hiding in the void is Tang An’s talent, and it’s even quite difficult for me to find her if she doesn’t want to be noticed. Alright, I’ll arrange an array first so she won’t easily observe us when we got some happy time later.”</p><p>“Or you can just arrange the array in advance, at least in the bedroom we stay in,” said Kang Xia helplessly. “Else, I’d always have goosebumps haunting me.”</p><p>Tang Xiu hollowly laughed and nodded.</p><p>“Anyhow, what plans did you discuss with Long Hanwen, though?” asked Kang Xia. “It seems that there are tons of good shows to watch!”</p><p>“Long Zhengyu is my friend and some people injured him gravely.” Tang Xiu said, “There’s no way I can just sit back and do nothing. They dare to assault him here, so they must pay the price. However, our company is now in the limelight and at the forefront of the wave, so I can’t just do anything that can harm its reputation. That’s why I can only deal with this Harbo Group in secret.”</p><p>“Is there anything I can do to help?” asked Kang Xia.</p><p>“You don’t have to do anything else for the time being.” Tang Xiu shook his head. “Also, Hao Lei will come to Star City in a few days. I will need your advice when I discuss something with her later.”</p><p>“Is it about the auction?” asked Kang Xia hurriedly.</p><p>Tang Xiu nodded and continued, “That’s right. It’s indeed about the auction. And I also have some other ideas in mind. The Magnificent Tang Corporation only has a few products, so I think it would be great to establish the biggest auction house in the world along with the Grand Fortune Jewelry. And I also have a way to spice up the situation of the auction house later.”</p><p>“With what methods, exactly?” Kang Xia asked hurriedly.</p><p>“Medicinal pills,” Tang Xiu answered with a smile.</p><p>“You want to sell those pills to outsiders?” Kang Xia was surprised.</p><p>“I’m going to develop two types of pills,” explained Tang Xiu. “One is a drug that can temper the body and another one that can prolong life. These two pills won’t be very effective, but it will be very beneficial to whoever takes it for many years.”</p><p>“So these two pills will be the main and finale articles of every auction, then?” asked Kang Xia again.</p><p>“That’s right.” Tang Xiu nodded. “I’m sure just these two pills are enough to make people all over the world go crazy. However, these two pills will need to be packaged and sold under the brand name of healthcare products.”</p><p>“I can already see those super-rich people all over the world flocking here.” Kang Xia nodded.</p><p>“I’m quite amazing, am I not?” Tang Xiu smilingly said.</p><p>Kang Xia kissed him on the lips and faintly said, “You know, I thought you were a guy who was oblivious of the immensity of the world when I first received your call. I thought you were playing a prank on me intentionally back then. Back when I came to Star City and first met you, I kinda felt very disappointed and thought that you were too young. However, I’m now glad and feeling fortunate for the decision I made before.”</p><p>“I was so dirt poor and very weak at that time.” Tang Xiu replied with a smile, “To be honest with you, the success and development of the Magnificent Tang Corp for these two years can never be separated from you. It should be I who should be grateful for being able to get such a cherished treasure like you.”</p><p>Kang Xia smiled. “Well, Andy is also a precious treasure…”</p><p>“Ugh…”</p><p>Tang Xiu’s expression stiffened and suddenly, a headache struck his head.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
