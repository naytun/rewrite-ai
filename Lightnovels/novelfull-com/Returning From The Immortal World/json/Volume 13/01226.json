He immediately dialed Tang Xiu’s number and spoke to him in a deep tone, “Come home right away. I have something to talk to you.”</p><p>“Give me half an hour,” replied Tang Xiu on the phone.</p><p>Less than an hour later, Tang Xiu came back from the outside. He let out a smile after seeing Tang Yunpeng and said, “I heard Duanmu Lin came over?”</p><p>Tang Yunpeng excitedly asked, “Xiu’er, care to tell me how you did it? He… he’s, well… a bit different from before.”</p><p>“It’s nothing big, actually.” Tang Xiu smilingly replied, “Duanmu Lin is the Director of the Special Abilities Bureau and I thought that having him on our side will be very beneficial to our family, so I taught him a cultivation technique and gave him some pills. Well, I also promised him that he could join the Tang Sect and become a true cultivator after a few decades, as well as… allowing him to leave with us.”</p><p>“Leave? Where to?” asked Tang Yunpeng hurriedly.</p><p>“The Immortal World,” answered Tang Xiu with all seriousness.</p><p>Tang Yunpeng suddenly jolted and asked in shock, “The Immortal World? As in… the realm which is the final destination of all cultivators after they’ve ascended?”</p><p>“That’s correct!” Tang Xiu nodded.</p><p>Tang Yunpeng fell into silence for a long while and then seriously asked, “Xiu’er, where’s this Immortal World, exactly? Is it really like what has been told in legends—a paradise-like realm… like a Heaven?”</p><p>“The scenery in the Immortal World is indeed like Paradise, and there also exists great things hard to find on Earth. However, that place is not Heaven.” Tang Xiu shook his head and there was a hint of a sneer on his expression. “Honestly describing it, that place is like Hell compared to Earth.”</p><p>“You…” Tang Yunpeng opened his mouth but didn’t know how to express his feeling.</p><p>“First Uncle, any world is based on a natural selection where only the fittest will survive.” Tang Xiu said, “What I just said may sound a bit extreme, but it isn’t groundless nor unreasonable. If you want to feel that the Immortal World is a paradise, then you must possess formidable strength, for the weak will only live like dogs or pigs over there. It’s a place where law, order, and true peace have never existed. The whole Immortal World is hundreds of millions of times bigger than the Milky Way. You can find myriads of races and countless powerful experts literally everywhere. You must think that Immortals are powerful beings, right? Let me tell you, thousands of Immortals meet their demise literally every day. Even the number of souls who meet their end every day could reach hundreds of millions.”</p><p>After seeing Tang Xiu stop explaining, Tang Yunpeng murmured, “Yet you still want to take our family…”</p><p>Tang Xiu raised his hand to interrupt him and seriously said, “First Uncle, if you want to be stronger and live longer, then the Immortal World is where you must go. That place has Immortal Pills and Immortal Ambrosia and you can also temper yourself to be more powerful there. Don’t you want to live for thousands of years, tens of thousands of years, or even longer? Do you not want to have the ability to destroy a planet with the flick of your finger and ruin a galaxy with a single punch? Uncle, Earth is too small a place. Only by going to a higher plane can we enjoy much better scenery while continuously seeking the meaning of life and living a thrilling and magnificent life.”</p><p>Tang Yunpeng felt like his blood was boiling, a surging urge he had never felt before.</p><p>The Immortal World and possessing formidable power himself!</p><p>He then stared at Tang Xiu fixedly and asked in a heavy voice, “How did you know about all this, Xiu’er?”</p><p>Tang Xiu took a deep breath and shook his head before slowly saying, “Uncle, I can’t tell you about this as of now, so please inquire no longer. The day we set foot in the Immortal World, I’ll naturally explain everything to you. What you need to do now is to go all out in cultivation. I hope you can at least reach the Spirit Formation Stage a few decades later. Alright, you won’t be able to fathom many things I say as of now, so I’ll teach you how to cultivate first.”</p><p>Tang Yunpeng nodded.</p><p>Late at night.</p><p>As Tang Xiu headed to the door and was about to return to his room to rest, Tang Yunpeng’s voice came from behind him. “Xiu’er, Duanmu Lin told me something today. He said that I’ll be transferred soon and my next station should be Shanghai.”</p><p>Tang Xiu halted his pace and smilingly replied, “Well, our Magnificent Tang Corp. does indeed still need your care if you’re in Shanghai, Uncle. Besides, having wealth is indispensable if we want to stand tall on this planet, to begin with. Not to mention that we’re going to spend a lot of money in the next 10, 20, or 30 years. Even 1 trillion yuan is perhaps not sufficient for our purpose.”</p><p>“No worries.”</p><p>Tang Xiu spent the next three days visiting the HQ of Special Abilities Bureau to have a drink with Duanmu Lin and discuss some issues, then he gave the man some cultivation resources before leaving. Afterward, he stayed at the Tang Family’s residence to cultivate and taught a cultivation technique to Tang Yunpeng and helped him in his cultivation.</p><p>After spending three days, Tang Yunpeng could already sense the circulation of energy in his system. But it was mainly due to Tang Xiu not hesitating to expend his own cultivation and doing his best to guide Tang Yunpeng in his cultivation.</p><p>****</p><p>December 15th.</p><p>Large snowflakes fell without any warning early in the morning. There was no announcement from the weather station that snow would fall today. Tang Xiu was about to leave Beijing for Shanghai when he received a call from Bai Tao.</p><p>“Tang Xiu, Qin Shaoyang and I are at Monarch Club. Care to join us?”</p><p>“Got it. I’m heading there right away.”</p><p>Tang Xiu hung up. He did have the intention to see Bai Tao and Qin Shaoyang before leaving. He didn’t have many friends in Beijing except for these two. Especially Bai Tao, whom he got acquainted with when he first came to Jingmen Island and thanks to his relationship with Long Zhengyu and Ouyang Lulu. It could be said that Bai Tao helped him purchase a lot of precious herbs which had helped him greatly when he just returned to Earth.</p><p>He then left the house and walked out of the alley. After catching a cab on the street and telling the driver to head to the Monarch Club, he then called Mo Yi in Shanghai.</p><p>“Is there something up, Tang Xiu?” Mo Yi’s voice came from the phone.</p><p>“Professor Mo, can you put off your current work? I’ll be in Shanghai tonight and there’s something I need to speak with you about,” said Tang Xiu.</p><p>“Do you have some other big plans in mind, Tang Xiu?” asked Mo Yi. “The current research project is at a critical juncture. I think we can expect a good outcome in about 2 months.”</p><p>“The next plan is very important. It isn’t only for you, but it will also bring endless benefits for humanity as a whole.” Tang Xiu said, “Well, let’s talk about it later. Wait for me in… Paradise Manor.”</p><p>“Alright, then!”</p><p>Mo Yi knew that Tang Xiu was never one who talked big. Since he said there was an important issue to talk about, then it should be very important.</p><p>Tang Xiu hung up and was about to phone Duanmu Lin when he suddenly heard the cab driver smilingly saying, “You youngster does really have a way in putting airs, Little Brother. A plan that is so great that it can greatly benefit humanity as a whole? Care to share it with me?”</p><p>Tang Xiu glanced at him and lightly said, “Well, the plan is very simple. I’m going to build a few places for human habitation in the Milky Way. Besides, our human race is nesting way too long on Earth, so we should start to set foot on the journey to govern the universe. That’s why we must start inhabiting and developing the entire Milky Way. Also, humans must start to form an interstellar fleet to protect our hometown here.”</p><p>“Pfft, hahaha…”</p><p>The cab driver couldn’t help but burst out laughing. He patted the steering wheel and grinningly said, “Well, you’re really… amazing… little brother! I’ve seen many braggarts, but definitely none as amazing as you.”</p><p>Tang Xiu just let out a faint smile in response and didn’t retort back.</p><p>How could this cab driver understand his plan, to begin with?</p><p>At the Monarch Club.</p><p>With a cigarette clamped between his lips, Chen Haoran was hugging two pretty girls while provocatively staring at Qin Shaoyang. Next to him were five youths with unusual demeanors, with arms folded and wearing mocking expressions as they looked at the ashen Qin Shaoyan.</p><p>“I give you 2 weeks, surnamed Qin! If you still refuse to sign this contract by then, I’ll make sure you and your old man can never set foot in Beijing again! Just wait and see if you don’t believe me!” said Chen Haoran with a smile.</p><p>“Do you really think I’m afraid of you, Chen Haoran?” replied Qin Shaoyang with indifference. “You want to fight me so we both can perish together? Go ahead. The Qins may be just a small family, but don’t think we’re not ready to risk everything if you wanna have a go. I don’t believe your Chen family still has a foothold somewhere in Beijing after the clash, either.”</p><p>Chen Haoran’s expression changed and he fiercely said, “Hmph, you used to have Chu Yi and Tang Wei by your side and House Tang to cling onto, Qin Shaoyang. But now, the Tangs are nearly finished! I don’t know which powerful person they have offended, but all of them went missing. Whom can you depend on now? Who else can support you?”</p><p>“I will!”</p><p>Bai Tao came from a distance with a cigarette between his lips. He glanced at Chen Haoran and the five young men in front of him. He then indifferently said, “I don’t think the Tang Family is finished. Even if they are, there’s still my Bai family! Chen Haoran and the rest of you guys, Shaoyang is my friend. Don’t blame me for being ruthless if you dare to provoke him.”</p><p>Chen Haoran stared at Bai Tao with dread in his eyes. He was silent for a short while, then differently said, “Bai Tao, are you sure your family can fight against our six families?”</p><p>“I can still completely ruin your six families by myself even without the Bais.”</p><p>Tang Xiu came out of the corner several meters away. He then swept over everyone before his eyes landed on Chen Haoran and indifferently said, “Do you dare tell me who your family is? I’ll make sure your family will be removed from the capital overnight. Do you believe it or not?”</p><p>“Tang… Tang Xiu?”</p><p>Chen Haoran’s pupils shrunk with incredulity visible on his face. It was known that every member of House Tang had disappeared now except for Tang Yunpeng, so he never expected to see Tang Xiu here.</p><p>House Tang was a behemoth that had become a pressing existence in the hearts of many people. There was a day when nobody from any family dared to be their enemy, while Tang Xiu himself was the most treasured grandson of House Tang’s patriarch and a man who had done many sensational things in the country. Even if he had the courage, Chen Haoran had no guts to really confront Tang Xiu.</p><p>“What horseshit Tang Xiu, huh? All the members of the Tang family have resigned from the official posts and have all gone missing! Even their businesses have been merged into the Magnificent Tang Corp. What are you afraid of?!” Another young man was furious at Tang Xiu’s remarks and hurled mocking remarks in disdain.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
