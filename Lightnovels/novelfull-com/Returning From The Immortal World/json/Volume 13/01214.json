He needed time to digest what Tang Xiu had told him. He no longer bothered about the incident happened in Star City and, ever since he knew Tang Xiu, he was crystal clear his bottom line in no matter what he did. At the very least, he would never do anything harmful to the country.</p><p>That… was already enough for him!</p><p>****</p><p>Tang Xiu hurried to the Star City Chinese Medical Hospital the next morning. Long Zhengyu hadn’t yet woke up and Tang Xiu examined his condition again to make sure his system functions were gradually recovering and his injuries didn’t worsen. Only after he finished the examination did he finally feel relieved.</p><p>Shortly afterward, he headed to the Magnificent Tang Corporation and issued a series of orders, one of which was to send some people to various countries around the world to investigate the background of the multinational corporations that came to Star City.</p><p>Three days later, he contacted Jezek and asked him for the findings of the investigation. The man told him that he hadn’t yet found the person who secretly shot the video. Tang Xiu immediately expressed his anger and told Jezek to cease his investigation at once and that he would investigate it by himself. He also told the man directly that the Magnificent Tang Corporation would never cooperate with the Dandelion Group.</p><p>Immediately after, he held a plenary meeting to invite all the head representatives of these various countries’ corporations to come to the Magnificent Tang Corporation’s site.</p><p>Inside the conference room that was large enough to accommodate thousands of people, the head representatives of all companies sat quietly in the auditorium and waited for Tang Xiu’s arrival. Nobody spoke and there was no exchange whatsoever between them. The whole atmosphere was very heavy and quiet.</p><p>Creak…</p><p>As the door to the conference room was opened from the outside, 8 sturdy men quickly entered the hall and lined up in two rows. Tang Xiu was accompanied by Kang Xia and headed straight to the stage. His eyes coldly swept over the audience before he slowly started his speech. “Welcome to the Magnificent Tang Corporation, Ladies and Gentlemen.”</p><p>Clap, clap, clap…</p><p>The enthusiastic applause burst out and only gradually dissipated when Tang Xiu raised his hand.</p><p>Tang Xiu continued, “I’m perfectly aware of everyone’s purpose in coming to China and I’m crystal clear that each and every one of you are optimistic to cooperate with my Magnificent Tang Corporation. Prior to this, I was ready to sign a partnership with some of the corporations here because each of these companies does indeed have remarkable capital.</p><p>“However, you must have heard of the recent incidents in Star City as well. My best friend, Long Zhengyu, who’s also the Long Group’s successor, was seriously injured on his own site. He’s still unconscious now. I was very angry when I learned about it, but I had to suppress that anger since the people who hurt him are just like you—or rather, the friends of my company who came here for my company.</p><p>“I also helped to free the assailant who is from Harbo Group and squeezed my time to visit House Long’s residence with William from this company. I exhausted myself in the negotiation and favors I have to pay for it and only then was I barely able to help William free this person.</p><p>“I thought that was the end of this incident. I really did.</p><p>“But what happened next? Just a few days ago, the representatives of four companies led a group of martial artists under them and engaged in some mortal combats! Six dead bodies were even found in a hotel like the Long’s Dining Hall! Now I would like to ask you something here. Even after the Magnificent Tang Corporation has issued that announcement, some people still acted in a foolhardy and reckless manner. Do you think the honor of my company is so worthless that you can wantonly make such a huge incident in Star City? Do you think Tang Xiu’s words are so worthless that you can turn a deaf ear?”</p><p>The anger in Tang Xiu’s eyes looked more intense as he spoke up to this point. He tightly clenched his fist and punched the table powerfully and shouted, “I’m now very furious since the Chinese officials are now trying to pressure us, saying that we must pay attention to the public order and social stability of Star City and to never cooperate with such gangsters and the likes!</p><p>“Hence, I’m going to solemnly announce my stance to everyone now. The Magnificent Tang Corporation will NOT cooperate with any foreign companies for the time being. Even if you put out a mountain of gold before my eyes, you can expect to receive my rejection!”</p><p>Just as his voice faded away, all the representatives in the conference hall abruptly got up in that instant with disbelief on their faces. Many of them wore indignant expressions.</p><p>“But we have nothing to do with these incidents, Mr. Tang! You can’t just flatly deny us like that! We’ve always respected the law of your country and made every effort to prepare anything we could, hoping that we can cooperate with the Magnificent Tang Corporation.”</p><p>“Mr. Tang, those four American companies are indeed unreasonable! They took your words as a sideshow and should be punished. I think it’s right for your company not to cooperate with them. But we did nothing wrong and even poured all of our energy in order to strike the deal with your company. So please take back your statement and give us a chance. I believe my terms will satisfy you!”</p><p>“Please don’t act on impulse, Mr. Tang. We’re all businessmen and cooperation is what we do to make a fortune together. You just need to ignore those who don’t follow the rules and play gangsters like them.”</p><p>“Please take back what you just said, Boss Tang. We really came with sincerity and goodwill.”</p><p>“Mr. Tang…”</p><p>Many representatives spoke with anticipation on their faces.</p><p>Tang Xiu quietly listened to them until they finished speaking. Then, he indifferently said, “Then, how can I trust you? Can I still believe anyone of you? I’m now under pressure from the country, so I hope you can forgive and understand the circumstances we are in. Hence, the Magnificent Tang Corporation will shut its doors for any cooperation with any company for the time being. We need to revise and devise a new plan. So please go back and wait for our decision. Certainly, you can expect that we will select the approved companies among you after we’ve made the decision. We will send our representative to negotiate for the cooperation with the approved companies later.”</p><p>The meeting quickly ended with all the representatives feeling indignant. But Tang Xiu’s reasonings were indisputable, so nobody dared to jump out and confront him despite their discontent. Even these people wisely shut their mouths.</p><p>Shortly afterward, everyone jointly held a banquet at the Long’s Dining Hall and invited Tang Xiu to attend it. Tang Xiu didn’t refuse this time and engaged in some friendly chat and toasts with these representatives, and only didn’t mention anything about the cooperation.</p><p>And thus, these companies’ representatives from all over the world led their teams and left, and Star City suddenly turned tranquil for a while.</p><p>However, these representatives didn’t know that immediately after they left, Tang Xiu ordered some people of his company to leave for various countries in secret to conduct investigations on the background of their companies. A series of information was then transmitted continuously for the next month or so, which became the subject of analysis by Tang Xiu, Kang Xia, and the top executives of the Magnificent Tang Corporation.</p><p>The situation in China was tranquil, but thousands of miles away in the United States, the tide of undercurrents was moving in the dark. Whether it was the people of the Harbo, Dandelion or some others from other companies, as well as the big personages behind them, all of them issued orders to strike their enemies, be it openly or secretly.</p><p>And thus, the brutal and ruthless battles commenced under the surface.</p><p>Tang Xiu himself received information in Star City and learned that the Stygian Club and Pyramid were engaged in at least a dozen skirmishes in just a month. Additionally, another variable that Tang Xiu didn’t expect was the involvement of the League of Archcrusaders in the fray. They even secretly cooperated with the Pyramid people, resulting in heavy losses to the Stygian Club.</p><p>“Start the operation!”</p><p>While staying in Star City, Tang Xiu passed the order to the Tang Sect disciples who were laying dormant in the United States. Then, nearly 100 experts of the Tang Sect immediately moved to carry out a series of plans after receiving the order.</p><p>Adding fuel to the flames, framing and making other parties into scapegoats.</p><p>The ploys may seem despicable, but they did yield extremely outstanding results and eventually caused more severe frictions among the three forces. Even the most serious clash resulted in hundreds of deaths and thousands of injuries.</p><p>During this period, a message quickly proliferated around the world, even to some small remote countries, that the Magnificent Tang Corporation and the Grand Fortune Jewelry had jointly set a grand auction house and would hold an unprecedented huge auction on December 1st in Shanghai. The auction attendance itself was free for anyone and any force, with the only condition that they must prepare liquid cash of at least 9 figures.</p><p>Shortly after, another news was spread out that the threshold was raised since there were too many rich people who had a relationship with both companies wanting to attend this unprecedented auction. Thus, the threshold was raised to over 300 million in liquid cash. But for participants and forces who had registered in advance, they were still included in the original 100-million threshold.</p><p>On November 20th, Tang Xiu returned to Shanghai since the auction would soon be held. He invited some business friends in China in person and exempted them from the threshold along with others invited by him. Even then, most of these people still had net worth at least several billion yuan.</p><p>Shanghai.</p><p>Inside the luxury villa in Bluestar Villa Complex, Tang Xiu rubbed his temples with some headaches while looking at Andy, who acted like a cute lass. Sitting on the sofa opposite Andy was Mu Wanying, whereas Ouyang Lulu sat on the other side, discontentedly grinning with one of her legs atop the other.</p><p>“Uh, well, you gals can chat. I still got things to tend to.”</p><p>Tang Xiu was really reluctant to stay here. After leaving Bluestar Villa Complex at a very fast speed as though he was escaping from something, only then did he finally feel relieved secretly.</p><p>He believed those three queens wouldn’t start World War III since they were in his house, so they would at least tolerate each other no matter how noisy their quarrel became.</p><p>“Where I should go…?”</p><p>Tang Xiu’s face looked a bit dull when he stood at the entrance of Bluestar Villa Complex and looked at the coming and going cars on the avenue. Only then did he realize that he had nowhere to go.</p><p>Ring, ring, ring…</p><p>The crisp ringtone of his cell phone rang, so he instantly took it out and looked at the caller on the screen. The caller turned out to be Jin Xingkui.</p><p>“What’s up, Brother Jin?” asked Tang Xiu directly after he picked up the call.</p><p>“I called you since I heard you’ve returned to Shanghai, Brother Tang,” replied Jin Xingkui with a happy tone. “Anyways, do you have some time so we can drink some cups?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
