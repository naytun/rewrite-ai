Never once had he ever faced any event that made him feel so strange and terribly flustered like this one.</p><p>What should I do?</p><p>Countless thoughts swirled through his mind, but he found that there was nothing he could do. He couldn’t even find the one responsible for the assassination so far—the one who gave them so much pain. After a long time, he then shouted, “Contact Old Wolf! He has been dormant in China for too long and it’s time for him to wake up! Tell him that we must find Cal Solun no matter the cost, else all of us will be in for big trouble.”</p><p>“Understood!” The sturdy man replied respectfully.</p><p>William sighed inwardly. He already spent 800 million yuan. If he failed to bring Cal Solund back to the U.S, it was very likely that this brat’s father, that ruthless major stakeholder of Harbo Group would butcher him!</p><p>BANG…</p><p>The sound of gunfire in the distance reached his ears.</p><p>William’s expression changed. He ran to the wall where the windows hadn’t been installed yet and set his sight to the distant horizon. Within the distance that his eyes could see, a group of sturdy people was chasing several people. Along with the continuous sound of gunfire, some of the fleeing people fell to the ground. The same scene also happened to some people who pursued them. The chaser and the chased kept firing at each other and mutually claimed the lives from both sides.</p><p>“It’s Old Wolf, Director!”</p><p>The sturdy man nearby suddenly turned his head and cried out quickly.</p><p>William trembled. As the two sides got closer, he could also see Old Wolf running while holding someone whose face he couldn’t see clearly.</p><p>“Let’s catch up and support them!”</p><p>William pondered for a moment and immediately shouted.</p><p>Suddenly, two figures dashed away downstairs with extremely fast movements like spirit apes. They kept grabbing the handrails of the stairs before jumping down, and quickly, they appeared on the first floor of the building. As Old Wolf was less than 300 meters away from them, the two men dashed toward him quickly under the shielding of a low bunker.</p><p>“WHO IS IT?”</p><p>Old Wolf desperately ran as fast as he could while towing Cal Solund when he suddenly noticed that some people were hiding nearby and immediately shouted. However, he immediately regretted his action after seeing the two big men hiding in the corner.</p><p>It turned out that they were on the same side.</p><p>His heart eased up a lot. He didn’t wait for an answer and quickly rushed into the building. The ten or so experts left beside him also dashed into the building and disappeared in a flash.</p><p>At their rear, about less than 50 men with guns led by two men and a woman, bolted fast to the building quickly. They didn’t immediately enter the building for fear of an ambush.</p><p>Slash, slash, slash…</p><p>Just as these forty-plus men scattered around, two figures suddenly appeared from hidden spots on both sides. In just a few seconds, four big men were grabbed from behind and a hand covered their mouths while sharp daggers flashed to tear their throats and pierce their hearts.</p><p>The killing of these four people didn’t even alarm anyone around.</p><p>In front of the building.</p><p>Of the three people who acted as their leaders was a very tall woman. A strong aura exuded from her even though she was wearing gold-rimmed glasses. She twisted her neck and fiercely said, “Jezek, C. Lawrence, our men have clearly investigated the Harbo’s manpower in China. Except for that old dog William, this Old Wolf is the last one. They both have run here for their last struggles, so I suggest our three parties send our men in to kill them right away!”</p><p>Jezek grinned hideously. He stroked his chin and said, “It was quite difficult, but we managed to force William to flee to this place, so we can definitely kill them without anyone noticing. With that Old Wolf fleeing here, it means this place is their designated meeting point. Let’s stop procrastinating and strike them!”</p><p>“ATTACK!”</p><p>C. Lawrence also shouted fiercely.</p><p>In the building, William looked at Cal Solund Old Wolf brought to him. The looming killing intent was visible in his eyes as he regretted his choice in striking Long Zhengyu and using this damned idiot Cal Solund for the purpose. How could this messed up incident happen if it wasn’t because of the incident with the Long Family?</p><p>“William buddy, we gotta find a way to flee this place. The Dandelion, Cupid, and Sava Groups sent quite the number of their experts to chase us. We’ll just wait for death if we stay here,” Old Wolf said. He was a man in his 40s with dark skin and a not so tall figure—the type of average-looking and inconspicuous man among the crowd.</p><p>William took a deep breath and replied, “I’ve never been so sure prior to this, but I can tell now that the three of them are really against us. But there’s something I don’t get. Why did they join forces all of a sudden to deal with us? Although there were some frictions between me and them, it wasn’t enough to make them tear all decorum and fight to the bitter end like this. Besides, there’s another thing making me wonder. Do they not want to get the cooperation contract with the Magnificent Tang Corporation?”</p><p>Old Wolf’s eyes flickered and he replied without being salty or weak, “I think it’s likely that those three companies have reached some kind of secret agreement with the Magnificent Tang Corporation. It’s either that or the Star City’s Long Group is involved in this farce. But in short, we are now enemies with them either in public or in the dark.”</p><p>William analyzed it for a short while. He felt helpless inwardly, but there were no other better means available for him, so he issued an order. “Notify them both that we’re retreating!”</p><p>In the passageway where the elevator was designated to be built, a rope was hung to the basement. William and his men grabbed the rope and descended quickly and the dozen people arrived in the underground parking lot.</p><p>“Let’s go! Those bastards will never expect us to flee. Find a way to escape to Star City and leave China as quickly as possible! As long as we return to the U.S., I can make those bastards pay a painful price.” William powerfully raised his fist and shouted with boiling killing intent.</p><p>But as his voice faded away, a group of figures flickered and approached fast. These tens of shadows quickly appeared at the entrance of the spacious underground parking lot in a few seconds.</p><p>At the front were Jezek, C. Lawrence, and the woman with steaming killing aura, Avril. All of whom stared dagger at William with visible contempt on their faces. Jezek was the first to pace forward and smilingly said, “Have you been well, my old buddy, Sir William?”</p><p>William frowned and, with killing intent overflowing in his eyes, he coldly replied, “Jezek! You damned dog bastard! I really should’ve killed you in the U.S.”</p><p>The smile on Jezek’s face disappeared without a trace. He raised his right arm and shouted as he flung it down, “Annihilate them!”</p><p>“KILL!”</p><p>C. Lawrence and Avril didn’t hesitate. Everyone had come to this point and all of them were decisive people when it came to battles. They immediately stormed over towards William and his dozen men.</p><p>Guns were of no use in this situation, so each and every one of the combatants took out their respective cold weapons and engaged in mortal combat for a while. William himself wanted to flee immediately, but he kept getting pestered by Jezek’s group of three. If it wasn’t for Old Wolf protecting him at the side after he put down Cal Solund, he would have been killed by these people at the first strike.</p><p>In a hidden corner about tens of meters away from the scene, Tang An with her usual bronze mask witnessed the unfolding scene with an excited look in her eyes. At the same time, she was holding a video recorder to tape the scene of this fight.</p><p>“KILL THEM ALL!”</p><p>William tilted his head up and roared all of a sudden. His suit suddenly blasted out as the muscles all over his body started contracting. In just a few breaths, the size of his figure was enlarged several times and his height now reached about 2 meters high with hairs crazily elongated from head to toe.</p><p>“You’re a werewolf?!!”</p><p>Jezek, C. Lawrence, and Avril were flabbergasted. Jezek. however, felt an especially deep regret after finding out that William was a werewolf. He swung over his long blade towards Lawrence, whose position was very close to him, and directly slew the man before he kicked Avril afterward.</p><p>The sudden change was really unexpected. It made all the combatants around stop fighting and look at Jezek with disbelief on their faces.</p><p>Jezek raised his head up and roared as his body began to transform. In just a few seconds, he also turned into a werewolf.</p><p>Avril’s pupils shrunk and she angrily shouted, “These damned werewolves are all members of the Stygian Club! I truly failed to notice that these damned Harbo and Dandelion Groups turn out to be industries owned by the Stygian Club. Everyone, KILL THEM! KILL THEM ALL!!!”</p><p>William looked ecstatic. It never crossed his mind that Jezek, who used to have many grudges with him, turned out to be a werewolf just like him—a member of his own race. For a moment, the feeling of climbing back to heaven from hell made him burst out into laughter. “HAHAHA, let’s kill them all, Brothers! Let’s kill these Cupid and Sava bastards!”</p><p>“KILL!”</p><p>“DIE…”</p><p>The intense mortal combat ensued yet again in the unbuilt underground parking lot. Jezek’s crossover led to serious blows against the Cupid and Sava Groups. Further, Lawrence had been killed and the experts from the Cupid Company were as though losing their backbone and gradually fell into a disadvantage.</p><p>A ray flickered in Avril’s bloodshot eyes as she watched her men falling in the surroundings, as well as those Cupid people who looked to have the intention of escaping. She suddenly shouted aloud, “Everyone, listen! Whether it’s the brothers or sisters from Cupid or Sava, I’ll reward whoever kills the enemy! You’ll get 100 grand for each man you kill, and I’ll top up the reward to 10 million dollars if we can annihilate them completely!”</p><p>As always, many people would transform into brave combatants when such generous rewards were offered.</p><p>In that instant, everyone from either the Cupid or Sava Groups was as though having taken steroids. They blasted out their whole battle potential and doubled their combat power. Some of them straightly stormed over the enemy and roared aloud while killing them. The fortune stimulated their nerves and aroused their spirit to fight and kill again to get more rewards.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
