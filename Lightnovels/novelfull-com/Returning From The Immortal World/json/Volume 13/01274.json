Keep in mind, you just need to investigate these people from various countries around the world. I’ll assign someone else to deal with the following moves later.”</p><p>“Understood!”</p><p>Jin Shi replied and was about to hang up when he suddenly recalled something else. After a moment of hesitation, he said, “Are you now in a secret base in China, Your Majesty?”</p><p>“Yes, I just arrived here,” Tang Xiu said.</p><p>“Your Majesty, according to our intel cells in China, there are two groups of foreign forces that have infiltrated the Hetian recently. Our intel operatives encountered those two groups two days ago and injured four people before they finally lost their tracks. From the last trails, before they disappeared, we inferred that they should be heading towards the Taklimakan Desert. Further, we also found from surveillance video that they have purchased living supplies in Hetian City, which means that they’re preparing to infiltrate the desert.”</p><p>“You mean, they came for this secret base?” Tang Xiu asked.</p><p>“I dare not guarantee it 100%,” said Jin Shi.</p><p>Tang Xiu pondered for a short while and said, “Text me the number and characteristics of these two groups and all the intel information you’ve gathered about them. Additionally, assign some people to monitor the Hetian region. If you spot them again, don’t make a rash move and just directly report to me.”</p><p>“Acknowledged!”</p><p>Tang Xiu hung up and shifted to Duanmu Lin, asking, “Has any foreign force sneaked into the Taklimakan Desert?”</p><p>Duanmu Lin forced a smile and said, “A total of 23 people came to the Taklimakan Desert in these 3 years, but all of them were killed by our people. They were intel operatives from various countries and forces, many of whom were practitioners. In fact, this secret base itself is extremely hidden, but we need many materials and we must purchase the mechanical molds from abroad. It’s inevitable that it would attract attention.”</p><p>Tang Xiu nodded silently. Then, he said, “I’ll order my intel operatives to closely monitor the movements in China to keep all the spies away. But Jin Shi just reported to me that two groups of people sneaked into the Hetian region and their goal should be this place. Are you going to send your men to remove them or should I go deal with them myself?”</p><p>“I’ll send my men to deal with them!” Duanmu Lin said after thinking about it.</p><p>“Alright,” Tang Xiu said.</p><p>Quickly, Zhu Long left with tens of formidable ability users. None of them brought high-tech weapons so as to prevent any accidents, and they didn’t take the strange green vehicle either. They just drove the desert off-road vehicles that were commonly used in the world and quickly sped up in the Hetian region’s direction.</p><p>Meanwhile, Tang Xiu toured the secret base under Duanmu Lin’s lead. Many of the tech products were objects that Tang Xiu had seen, so he didn’t feel a bit interested.</p><p>“What’s this place?”</p><p>Four-plus hours later, when everyone passed through another door to the outside, Tang Xiu noticed that Duanmu Lin didn’t seem to want to lead him inside. He immediately pointed to a certain spot and asked.</p><p>“It’s nothing worth visiting since it’s only a warehouse that stores energy crystals,” Duanmu Lin lightly said. “In front of us is an alien plant botanic area. That place will definitely be an eye-opener for you.”</p><p><em>Energy crystals?</em></p><p>Tang Xiu was secretly taken aback. When he handed over the energy crystal converter to Duanmu Lin previously, he had secretly sent his people to evacuate a large number of energy crystals stored in the three-star vestige. He even duplicated the energy converter and the method to manufacture energy crystals. Over the past three years, the members of the Empire on Nine Dragons Island under Mo Yi’s leadership had been secretly manufacturing these energy crystals with four lines of energy converters. Each line could produce nearly 100 energy crystals every day.</p><p>“Duanmu Lin.”</p><p>Tang Xiu had no intention to leave anymore, and his tone when addressing this man changed.</p><p>Hearing the new address made Duanmu Lin’s heart thump, but he kept a calm expression on the surface and said, “Are you not interested in the alien plant botanic area? We can have a look elsewhere if you’re not really interested.”</p><p>A hint of disappointment flashed in Tang Xiu’s eyes. He shook his head and said, “I want to remind you that you only have two years left. If you’re still unable to put away your idea, then I’m afraid you can only stay here forever.”</p><p>Duanmu Lin was slightly furious inside. He was a great personage and an experienced man, how could he not sense the threat in Tang Xiu’s words? The threat aroused his resentment and triggered his inborn stubbornness as he said lightly, “I have my own duty. As long as I’m in this position, I’ll stay here.”</p><p>Tang Xiu suddenly smiled, and his smile was particularly very bright as he said, “Anyhow, I’m really curious about the alien plant botanic area. Take me to see it!”</p><p>Duanmu Lin looked at Tang Xiu’s back as he turned and left with an upside-down mood and complicated feelings. Had Tang Xiu insisted, he wouldn’t stop Tang Xiu from entering the energy crystal storehouse and would even give him some if he asked.</p><p>Tang Xiu, however, didn’t insist. He even showed such an expression even after he stubbornly showed his stance. At this moment, he realized that Tang Xiu had given up on him.</p><p>He opened his mouth and wanted to apologize, but he quickly swallowed it back. However, regret crazily grew inside his heart.</p><p>In case that he was given another chance, he would’ve never refuted Tang Xiu, let alone said that. However, he knew that Tang Xiu never went back once he decided on something. No matter how he explained and pleaded, there was no hope left for him.</p><p>Still, the Immortal World was a place he had been wanting to go so much. He wanted to live longer and become stronger. But his impulse threw away this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity and filled his heart with bitterness.</p><p>****</p><p>In the next two days, Tang Xiu stayed at the base, observing various high-tech products. He even had the impulse to refine some high-tech magical tools or even immortal tools.</p><p>“Ah Lang, what do you think about the effect that can be produced by combining immortal cultivation with science and technology?” Tang Xiu spoke while standing on the oasis above the base with a thoughtful look.</p><p>“Immortal cultivation has immortal power, whereas science and tech also offer its respective benefits. The combination of the two by utilizing the advantage of each and eliminating its weaknesses will certainly produce infinite benefits. However, how to combine them still needs to be considered and researched further. Otherwise, we can expect deviations to occur and damage both aspects.”</p><p>Tang Xiu nodded in response and looked at Tang Ahlang. “You’ve made great progress in just three years. I can tell that you’ve really grown up, just missing the last step.”</p><p>Tang Ahlang was a bit embarrassed by Tang Xiu’s remarks, but there was still a hint of confusion in his eyes as he asked, “What last step, Master?”</p><p>“Well, you’re still a boy and not yet a man, in my eyes.” Tang Xiu chuckled and said, “Only when you’ve tasted the nourishment from a woman can you be considered as a real man, you know.”</p><p>“Ugh…”</p><p>An awkward look painted Tang Ahlang’s boyish face. He shook his vigorously and stated, “I’d rather stay as a boy forever than become a man, Master. I’m afraid that I’ll end up like you.”</p><p>“Huh? Come again?” Tang Xiu looked dull.</p><p>Tang Ahlang grinningly said, “Well, I’ve seen how fierce Master’s wives are.”</p><p><em>Cough, cough…</em></p><p>Tang Xiu’s breathing stopped for a moment, and he coughed hard several times afterward. If Tang Ahlang were 10 years younger, he would have definitely smacked his ass.</p><p>This brat unexpectedly… How could he dare to rebuke and tease his own Master?!</p><p>Suddenly, Tang Xiu’s expression shifted and he looked towards the distance. To his surprise, Zhu Long and two experts from the Special Abilities Bureau were fleeing in the desert a few kilometers away. Bleeding wounds could be seen all over their bodies, while tens of figures were moving lightning-fast behind them in hot pursuit.</p><p>“They are foreigners, Master,” Tang Ahlang said.</p><p>Tang Xiu nodded and said, “Zhu Long led a team a few days ago to hunt and kill those two groups that have sneaked into the desert. It’s very likely that he ran into some powerful people and got hunted, ending up so badly like this.”</p><p>Having said that, his slim figure flickered and appeared in front of Zhu Long in less than two breaths. Seeing how their miserable condition, he asked indifferently, “How about the others?”</p><p>The three people finally relaxed the moment they saw Tang Xiu. Zhu Long squeezed out a bitter smile and replied with wriggling lips, “They are all dead. Mr. Tang, they are very powerful. Much more powerful than anyone who has infiltrated the desert previously.”</p><p>Tang Xiu nodded and said, “As far as I know, there should be two groups of them. What about the other one?”</p><p>“The other group was from the Stygian Club. We had just got rid of them when these Pyramid people intercepted us. All of us might have died had we not fought so desperately.”</p><p>“Zhu Long, go back and tell Duanmu Lin that I will not come here again from now on,” Tang Xiu said. “Also, I want him to not look me anymore. Further, I hope he never forgets the promises and commitments he gave me before.”</p><p>“What do you mean?” Zhu Long looked bewildered, but he finally nodded silently.</p><p>During their talk, tens of experts from Pyramid had already surrounded the five people. Their leader, a big man, who wore a black mask and wielded a long saber, coldly glared at Tang Xiu and said, “It seems that our previous investigation is correct. You guys are absolutely carrying out a project in this desert. Spit out what you’re doing here and maybe I can spare your life.”</p><p>Tang Xiu indifferently smiled and said, “You should have bought that magic long saber at the Genesis Auction House in Shanghai three years ago, right?”</p><p>“How did you know that?” The big man’s expression changed and he looked vigilant.</p><p>“Because I’m the one who made it.” Tang Xiu slightly smiled. “If you don’t believe me, take a look at the hilt. There’s a small character on it.”</p><p>“Tang?”</p><p>The big man didn’t even glance at the hilt, but his finger pressed on the small mark.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
