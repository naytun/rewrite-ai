A rich life force began to flow back to Tang Xiu continuously, improving his cultivation by leaps and bounds and sharply increasing his strength.</p><p>This strength and power…</p><p>Deeply sensing the taste of this power and the feeling of bloating up and that everything was under his control, Tang Xiu was slightly trembling. It was a stage he had experienced before—something he was very aware of. Although his body had incorporated the Immortal Force, he couldn’t be regarded as an ordinary immortal at all as his power was now comparable to an Earth Immortal expert.</p><p>But the most important thing from such a sharp rise in power was the fact that he could now use many immortal secret arts and divine abilities he was previously unable to. With his current strength, he could even easily kill ordinary Celestial Immortals.</p><p>“It does feel great.”</p><p>As the Immortal Tribulation subsided, Tang Xiu slowly stretched his body and a confident smile climbed up his face. He couldn’t help but whisper to himself inwardly.</p><p>Suddenly, his smile was frozen and he spaced out for a short while. He suddenly realized another thing. Back when he crossed such tribulation in the past, he always had to face hallucinations, but he didn’t face one just now.</p><p>“Is it because I’ve removed the demon barrier in my heart, so I no longer have such mental demon’s disturbances?” Tang Xiu frowned before accepting his reasoning as a reasonable inference and slowly felt relieved from the tension.</p><p>At a faraway spot.</p><p>You Zhong was still dumbstruck and tongue-tied as the horrible Immortal Tribulation subsided. When he looked at Tang Xiu’s smiling face, he seemed to have just seen the most incredible marvel in his life and his mouth became slack-jawed.</p><p>Gu Yan’er, on the other hand, looked ecstatic. She turned to glance at You Zhong nearby and burst into laughter immediately, unable to hold her urge to. Then, she asked, “You feel that it was too easy, don’t you?”</p><p>“It looks too easy, indeed.”</p><p>Lips squirming, You Zhong murmured, “The might of the Immortal Tribulation I must face before was far worse than the one I just saw. It was like a narrow escape for me, and I was barely able to withstand it. But he… why do I feel like he just treated his tribulation like a joke? Such a mighty tribulation, yet it looks like it just gave him a tickle. This… there’s no way the Heavenly Dao all but sent such billowing thunders but turns out to only send him tiny drops of rain, right? Say, like deliberately throwing out the game to support him or something?”</p><p>“Pfft, hahaha…”</p><p>Gu Yan’er didn’t hold back her laughter. She then looked at the fella’s shocked expression and smilingly said, “Do you know who he is? He’s my Master. Such Immortal Tribulations to him is simply like a child’s play. I tell you one thing. He may have just crossed his Immortal Tribulation, but his present strength is very likely more than enough to make a Celestial Immortal like you kick the bucket.”</p><p>You Zhong slowly turned and looked at Gu Yan’er’s beautiful smiling face. Although her beauty did stir his heart, he still shook his head silently and then said, “He just got promoted to an ordinary Immortal. Even though he has rich combat experience and powerful strength, the most he can fight against is those at the Earth Immortal Stage at most. I think your notion is not funny if you think he can fight me.”</p><p>A playful look flashed in Gu Yan’er’s face and said, “No worries! There will be a time for you to see it.”</p><p>“Yan’er.”</p><p>Tang Xiu flashed and appeared in front of Gu Yan’er. He saw that You Zhong looked a bit strange but didn’t pay attention to him and lightly smiled instead. “Well, since I’ve successfully crossed the tribulation, then it’s time for us to deal with some more serious issues. Those three clans are too poor, and I just consumed a lot of the resources, so we need to grab more.”</p><p>“Are we gonna keep finding targets randomly in this vast region, Master?” Gu Yan’er nodded and said, “Say, like robbing some big clans in this Immortal Domain?”</p><p>“Nah.” Tang Xiu shook his head and said, “We already robbed the three largest clans in this region. I don’t think we can get anything better if we go robbing the other clans here. Besides, if memory serves, the Polychromic Lucent Domain should be nearby. That region boasted many powerful Immortals, so we’re going to explore that place. We should be able to gain tons of harvest there.”</p><p>“Well, it’s indeed better to rob a powerhouse than ransacking some poor clans.” Gu Yan’er nodded and said, “Then, what about this guy, Master? Are we gonna kill him or just let him go?”</p><p>“There’s no need to kill him. He’s not our enemy, and his strength is not a threat to us.” Tang Xiu shook his head and said, “Alright, let’s have him follow us first, we can let him go after we have robbed enough cultivation resources.”</p><p>You Zhong wiped off the cold sweat from his forehead and interjected in a hurry. “Yes, yes! I may be weak, but I’m still a Celestial Immortal Stage expert. I’m sure there’s something I can do to help you. Besides, I don’t have any malice towards you and even feel grateful to you instead. Had it not been for you, I would’ve died in the hands of my clan’s people, let alone had my revenge.”</p><p>“You do have some discretion and are well aware of the situation.” Tang Xiu replied, “If anything, we don’t like to kill innocent people. We’ll take you to the place that has Auric Profusion Source later as long as you obey our orders. You can be sure that you won’t leave empty-handed, of course. When we snatch enough cultivation resources, we’ll give you a ten-thousandth of all the resources as a reward.”</p><p><em>A ten-thousandth share?</em></p><p>You Zhong’s eyes lit up and looked ecstatic. Even though a ten-thousandth may sound little, it was definitely an amazing amount of wealth to him. He knew that the number of cultivation resources this pair had robbed from those three clans was astronomical. Just those resources alone were already enormous.</p><p>“Thank you. Thank you, Senior. I’ll definitely spare no effort to do anything you ask me to.”</p><p>His manner was much to Tang Xiu’s satisfaction. Before they left in a flash, he even spoke to him, “You’re not bad yourself. You have never taken any resources from the You Clan all these years at least. Even though your strength is average, you do have quite a spirit. As Immortal cultivators, we must have the guts to fight against the Heavens, demons and all sorts of evildoers. The Immortal World is a brutal place where you’ll be eliminated if you don’t fight, and you can expect to die in the hands of more powerful enemies. If you keep cultivating diligently, there’s a chance that you can be a super powerful expert that shakes the plane in the future.”</p><p>You Zhong himself agreed with Tang Xiu’s words, but he couldn’t help but feel that he was being looked down at inwardly. A weak person who had just become an immortal gave him such guidance was truly like a not-funny joke.</p><p>A week later, the trio had arrived at the Polychromatic Lucent Starfield.</p><p>The region had a floating supercontinent so vast that one wouldn’t be able to see its border. Some celestial beings in the Immortal World had once tried to measure it one after another by flying, but the region was so big that even a Perfected Golden Immortal expert would spend several years flying from one end to another.</p><p>This starfield had a particular trait with the existence of soul-stirring and beautiful prismatic lights everywhere. However, the scarlet clouds fluttering in the air proved to hinder one’s sight greatly.</p><p>“This place is Polychromatic Lucent Starfield? I’ve only heard of this place before, but I’ve never been here.” You Zhong curiously watched the scene in the surroundings, but he was secretly alert inwardly because he had heard that this place was fraught with dangers and crises may greet anyone with each step they took. One slight carelessness was enough to kill anyone without a burial ground here.</p><p>Tang Xiu nodded in response and then said, “I’ve been here before, this place is indeed the Polychromatic Lucent Starfield. Alright, let’s set off. There’s a particular creature that will be greatly beneficial to us. Now that we’re here, we’re not just going to rob cultivation resources of others, but also get some good stuff.”</p><p>“What kind of special creature are you talking about, Master?” Gu Yan’er curiously asked.</p><p>“Firecloud Cicada.” Tang Xiu smiled.</p><p><em>Firecloud Cicada?</em></p><p>Gu Yan’er was stunned before she happily smiled. “Ah, that’s quite a good thing, indeed. If we can get them and obtain some other suitable materials, then we can refine a Versicolor Coral Garb.”</p><p>Yet again, a strange expression was cast on You Zhong’s face. Although Tang Xiu had just broken through to the Immortal Stage, to him, this man felt more and more mysterious.</p><p>He also knew about this Firecloud Cicada.</p><p>This creature was not only very powerful but also very valuable. A Firecloud Cicada could be sold for a lot of Immortal Stones. He wouldn’t need to worry about cultivation resources for at least a century if he could get one.</p><p>“This Firecloud Cicada is very powerful, Senior. I don’t think I have the slightest chance to catch it even if I run into one. Further, I heard that it exists in a very dangerous place. Should we reconsider the plan again?” You Zhong hesitated, but he still needed to voice his opinion for the sake of his own life.</p><p>Tang Xiu glanced at him and lightly said, “Nah, no need to reconsider anything. I already made up my mind.”</p><p>Afterward, the trio entered the territory of Polychromatic Lucent Starfield. After many days of fast travel, they finally stopped on a crimson mountain peak. It wasn’t like they didn’t want to continue their journey, but it was because there was a fight that blocked their path in front. The monstrous and fearsome sword energy and the swift and powerful sword light made all of them not dare to take it lightly.</p><p>“Interesting.”</p><p>Tang Xiu stood under a red tree and calmly watched the fight from tens of kilometers away. With his current eyesight, let alone seeing for tens of kilometers, he could even see the scene thousands of miles away clearly.</p><p>In the sky, tens of Immortal were involved in a fight. Precisely Speaking, those Celestial Immortals in white attire were besieging a black-robed man under the leadership of a Profound Immortal. The black-robed man himself was very strong and was at least at the Golden Immortal Stage. However, he was already full of scars and his injuries seemed very serious, he was barely able to fight back the tens of Celestial Immortals and that Profound Immortal.</p><p>What alerted Tang Xiu and Gu Yan’er was not the fight between the two parties, but rather the presence of the three old men standing near those people. Two of them were obviously a group with those Immortals in white, whereas one of them was with the black-robed big man.</p><p>Each of these three people had a very powerful aura. Gu Yan’er, who was an expert at the Golden Immortal Stage now, could tell from their aura alone that they at least had the same cultivation level as her. There was also a chance that they were Perfected Golden Immortal experts. Even if they were not, they should be at least at the Golden Immortal late-stage.</p><p>“Oh God! I know that Immortal who’s being encircled! He’s Darknorth Immortal, the Master of Aurelian Artifice Sect. How come such a dignified Golden Immortal Stage expert like fell into such a miserable situation?” You Zhong exclaimed in a low voice with disbelief on his face.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
