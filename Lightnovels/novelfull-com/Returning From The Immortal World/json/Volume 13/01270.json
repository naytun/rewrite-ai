This subordinate of yours should also feel the same.”</p><p>“That’s right!” The young man nodded and then added, “All of my money has been used to buy things that can help me improve my strength all these years indeed.”</p><p>“I suppose you always buy it on the black market, yes?” Tang Xiu smilingly said, “To be honest, I also have been wanting to visit the black market to broaden my knowledge. But I haven’t been able to go there since many things got me occupied.”</p><p>“Well, that place is neither a good or bad place if you ask me,” the young man replied.</p><p>Tang Xiu smiled indifferently in response, shifted back to Gao Beilei and faintly said, “The wicked tumors in the Magnificent Tang Corporation are to be eradicated directly. The list I just gave those guys is the names of Chen Liwei’s lackeys. Therefore, you are to announce that Chen Liwei and more than 20 people under him were fired by the company because of corruption. Other than that, you are to summon the Head of the Security Department of the Magnificent Tang Corporation here now!”</p><p>Gao Beilei nodded, but then she hesitated as she thought that Tang Xiu would strike the Security Department as well. “Boss, the Security Department’s Head, Su Ben, has always been a loyal and honest figure here. He’s also very capable. I don’t think he’s in cahoots with Chen Liwei’s group.”</p><p>Su Ben?</p><p>As a smile climbed up on Tang Xiu’s face, he could see the concern and worry flash past Gao Beilei’s eyes. Then, he chuckled and said, “I know Su Ben. But I’m a bit surprised to see you protecting him! That’s a surprise to me. I suppose you have a good personal relationship with him, yes?”</p><p>Gao Beilei hesitated before a bitter smile appeared on her face and she said, “Actually, we’ve been concealing our relationship to the company for the time being. But now that Boss asked me about it, I have to tell you that… Su Ben and I… are husband and wife. We already have the legal certificate for more than a year, but we haven’t had a banquet yet.”</p><p>“Huh? Come again?”</p><p>Tang Xiu suddenly got up from the sofa and looked at Gao Beilei incredulously, asking, “You… you got married to Su Ben? How did you… get together?”</p><p>Gao Beilei looked a bit shy, but she quickly suppressed it and replied, “Su Ben has an honest and pure character, and I gradually came to like him after getting along for some time. In actuality, it was I who pursued him…”</p><p>Tang Xiu looked at Gao Beilei with an expression of being at a loss whether he had to cry or laugh. He waved to the young man to leave, leaving him and Gao Beilei in the office. Afterward, he poured a cup of tea and took it as he walked to Gao Beilei and handed it to her, which made her extremely flattered. Then, he said, “Big Sis-in-law, I had no idea you had such a relationship with Brother Ben before, so many of my actions were rather offensive to you. I hope you can forgive me. Also… don’t tell Brother Ben about what happened between us today. Otherwise, he’ll definitely smack me for sure.”</p><p>Gao Beilei was flabbergasted and dumbly stared at Tang Xiu, who wore a forced smile. Her shock was even greater than when she heard Tang Xiu was a cultivator.</p><p>Big… sister-in-law?</p><p>The dignified Big Boss of the Magnificent Tang Corporation, a fearsome cultivator who is addressed by his subordinates as Your Majesty, a super big personage… yet he actually… called me… big sis-in-law?</p><p>This… what kind of a big joke is this?</p><p>Looking at Gao Beilei’s face, Tang Xiu realized that Su Ben hadn’t told her about his relationship with him, so he smiled and said, “Big Sis-in-law, Brother Ben and I actually grew up together. We used to live in the Su Family Village, and the two of us were neighbors. Well, strictly speaking, we are kind of relatives since each household in the entire Su Family Village is still related by blood. I brought Brother Ben to Star City and arranged for him to be a security guard at the winery then. I’ve been too busy all these years and even went into seclusion overseas to cultivate, so I have no idea about his progress and achievement now. It never occurred to me that he’d have married you secretly.”</p><p>Only now did Gao Beilei finally understand. Looking at Tang Xiu’s smiling face, she could feel his feelings.</p><p>“Boss, then you and Su Quan…”</p><p>“Well, we all grew up together. If you ask me,” Tang Xiu chuckled, “we’re all close brothers. And, although my family name is not Su, my mother is surnamed Su.”</p><p>Quickly after, Su Ben rushed into the General Manager Office and rapidly asked the moment he came inside, “Beilei, you called me over in such a hurry. Did something hap…”</p><p>He didn’t finish his words because he saw Tang Xiu.</p><p>Tang Xiu greeted him with a smile, opened his arm and laughed. “Hahaha, it’s been a few years since the last time I saw you, Brother Ben! Well, you look much better than before. To think that you even got married to Gao Lei, the famous General Manager of the Magnificent Tang Corporation. Damn! You truly deserve to be admired. That’s so damn great, Brother.”</p><p>Su Ben looked excited and his eyes were slightly red. He dashed towards Tang Xiu, opened his arms and gave a big hug. He slapped Tang Xiu’s back with his fists and then said, “I finally see you again, Tang Xiu! It’s been a few years indeed. I’d have gone already to search for you everywhere had it not been for Chief Kang telling me that you went into seclusion to cultivate.”</p><p>“No worries, Brother! I’m all fine and dandy!” Tang Xiu chuckled and smilingly said, “Anyhow, you seem much stronger now after more than 3 years, no? You have broken through to the Golden Core Stage?”</p><p>“Hahaha. It’s all thanks to you for sending those cultivation resources to me, Quan, and Xiangfei frequently, Brother!” Su Ben gruffly laughed and said, “Else, it would’ve been impossible for my cultivation to progress so quickly.”</p><p>Tang Xiu was stunned and then wryly smiled. “Uh, I never gave such an order. It should be Kang Xia!”</p><p>“Meh, we’re all family. You or Kang Xia are all the same.” Su Ben laughed.</p><p>Gao Beilei, on the other hand, was in disbelief as though she just got acquainted with Su Ben again and exclaimed with incredulity, “You… you’re also a cultivator?”</p><p>Su Ben said with an apologetic expression, “Please don’t blame me for hiding it from you, Beilei. Tang Xiu forbade us to tell anything to anyone about it. Not even to our loved ones. That’s why I never told you about it. But I’ve been meaning to talk to him when I meet him again later all this while, to see whether you can also cultivate.”</p><p>Gao Beilei’s mood was overly complicated. Everything that happened today made her feel like she was riding a roller coaster.</p><p>Suddenly, she seemed to recall something and hurriedly asked, “Then you should also know that Reese is also a practitioner, shouldn’t you? You also know that there are four powerful experts protecting me, right?”</p><p>Su Ben nodded and said, “I already knew their existence ever since I met you. However, I’ve talked with Reese in private and then learned that he wants to repay his debt. I know that not only will he not harm you, but he’ll also protect you in secret. As for those four guys sent by Chief Kang, well, Chief Kang notified me about it previously.”</p><p>Gao Beilei was annoyed and angrily snapped. “You had better kneel and do some washboard when you get home later!”</p><p>“Uh… I…”</p><p>Su Ben awkwardly raised his hand to scratch the back of his head.</p><p>Tang Xiu laughed secretly and watched as Gao Beilei played the strict wife against the henpecked Su Ben. He patted Su Ben’s shoulder and said, “Anyhow, when are you and Sis-in-law going to hold a wedding banquet, Brother Ben? That’s right, I gave Sis-in-law a jade pendant before to protect her safety, but it’s just a trashy one-time-use magic tool. Sis-in-law, please accept this cultivation technique manual. It’s a very powerful immortal cultivation technique, and you can begin cultivating straight away. Ask Brother Ben to guide you frequently and you’ll be able to make great achievements in the future.”</p><p>Gao Beilei took the cultivation technique manual and asked with a surprised look, “Boss, the jade pendant you gave before me… can it really protect me?”</p><p>“Yeah.” Tang Xiu nodded and explained, “It’s a defensive type magic tool. Though its grade is very low, it can protect you from any ordinary accident. For instance, a car accident. Even if a large truck speeding at 200 km/h were to directly hit you, you would still come out unscathed. You would also be okay even if someone were to shoot you with a gun. However, this magic tool will be destroyed after being used once.</p><p>Gao Beilei’s lips wriggled a few times and her heart moved a bit. She didn’t expect Tang Xiu to be concerned and considered her safety the first time he met her.</p><p>How could that jade pendant be regarded as trash? That was a life-saving amulet!</p><p>Subsequently, Tang Xiu and Su Ben recounted their old days before the three people left the General Manager Office. At the same time, a great storm was caused by the Magnificent Tang Corporation’s actions.</p><p>Chen Liwei, the Deputy General Manager of the Magnificent Tang Corporation, abused his position for personal gain, embezzled a huge amount of money and was directly fired.</p><p>The Director of Magnificent Tang Winery was in cahoots with Chen Liwei and was directly sacked due to the huge amount of funds he embezzled.</p><p>The Deputy Manager of the Magnificent Tang Sales Department…</p><p>The Regional Manager of the Magnificent Tang Corporation…</p><p>…</p><p>More than 20 mid-level and high-level executives of the Magnificent Tang Corporation were fired all at once—an event that shocked the entire company’s employees and made them scared.</p><p>Further, the personnel of the company also learned from the various channels that the Big Boss, Tang Xiu, had come back and all of the decisions were given by the Big Boss himself. It was then followed by an announcement:</p><p>“Big Boss has personally decreed that any senior executive of the Magnificent Tang Corporation, regardless of who and their position, that previously used his position for personal gain will receive reduced punishment as long as they admit their faults and return the embezzled money. Otherwise, once the investigation starts and they are found guilty, not only will they be fired, they will also be handed to the judiciary with follow-up legal proceedings.”</p><p>The news quickly spread throughout the entire Magnificent Tang Corporation in just half a day, and it was even known to the entire business society in Shanghai.</p><p>5:30 in the evening.</p><p>Before the employees of the Magnificent Tang Corporation got off work, more than a dozen high-level executives came and admitted their faults one after another. They pledged to return the embezzled money and were willing to be demoted and relegated.</p><p>As the General Manager of the Magnificent Tang Corporation, Gao Beilei was embarrassed to face Tang Xiu after all these incidents. However, Tang Xiu himself didn’t care about it. He just smiled and consoled her before he went straight to visit the industrial park. His actions made Gao Beilei grateful, and Su Ben felt warm inside.</p><p>During this time, another shocking and breaking news also quickly spread throughout the company and caused a great sensation.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
