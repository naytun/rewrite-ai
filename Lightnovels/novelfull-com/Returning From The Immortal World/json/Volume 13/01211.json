Still, the members of Cupid and Sava Groups were gradually falling into a weak position despite the heavy financial stimulus from Avril. After clearly noticing this situation, Avril immediately issued a retreat order. However, neither William nor Jezek wanted to give up the chance and began to pursue Avril and the rest.</p><p>The eyes of the seriously injured Old Wolf with Cal Solund next to him suddenly turned wide as he watched a sword tip pierced his chest. He was hardly able to turn his neck only to see a mysterious female with a bronze mask.</p><p>“This should be enough.”</p><p>A curved arc appeared at the end of Tang An’s mouth. Her figure then flickered and vanished afterward. She no longer kept watching the fight of these experts but quickly left at the speed of lightning.</p><p>The fight today was just the appetizer and a trailer, for the “real fun” would unfold next. When Tang An returned to South Gate Town and appeared outside the villa’s courtyard, her bronze mask-covered face looked a bit annoyed. She really couldn’t think of the reason why her Grand Master, Tang Xiu, would arrange such an array here that made her unable to appear before him silently.</p><p>“Kang Xia.”</p><p>The moment she came to the door, she saw Kang Xia sitting on the sofa silently in deep thought. Then, she indifferently asked, “Is Grand Master upstairs?”</p><p>Kang Xia laughed secretly. Tang An had never been able to silently enter the villa since Tang Xiu arranged the array here. With a slightly tilted mouth after seeing the slight anger in Tang An’s eyes, she said, “He’s waiting for the news in his study.”</p><p>“Hmph…”</p><p>Tang An softly snorted and turned toward the stairs.</p><p>Inside the study room.</p><p>Tang Xiu looked at Tang An who just came in and immediately got up from the sofa, asking, “You got everything recorded?”</p><p>Tang An gave him the camera and replied, “It’s been filmed, but I didn’t catch up to capture the final pursuit. You should watch this video, Grand Master. I’m sure you’ll find it very interesting.”</p><p>Tang Xiu’s expression slightly shifted and he immediately played the video.</p><p>After a long while, he turned to Tang An with a strange expression and asked, “So the Stygian Club’s people are behind Dandelion. But to think that the ones behind the Harbo Group are also from the Stygian Club is rather unexpected. That means, Cal Solund’s father should be a member, right?”</p><p>“That should be right.” Tang An nodded. “Even if he isn’t, he must have a deep connection with the Stygian Club.”</p><p>Tang Xiu took a deep breath and said, “I’m giving you another task, An. Immediately spread this video out. Make sure every force who came to Star City receives this video, but keep in mind to do it in secret. Additionally, send this video to the HQs of these four companies in the U.S. They want to play on the stage, so let’s fulfill their wish to have some good time to play well with one another to their hearts’ content.”</p><p>Tang An nodded in response. “Two of the top three forces in the world are involved. Regardless of the Stygian or Pyramid, these two forces are already in full swing in their clash. Even if this issue can’t make them tear all the remaining decorum, it’s very likely that this will add fuel to the flames. Also, is there anything else you would like me to carry out, Grand Master?”</p><p>Tang Xiu narrowed his eyes and slowly said, “Contact Mo Awu’s team to deal with the issues in Japan as fast as possible and then head to the U.S. to lurk in various cities there. I think this skirmish between Stygian and Pyramid will end in two months, so once their spat ends, Jin Shi will immediately head to the U.S. and start laying out the foundation for our intel network there.”</p><p>“I see.” Tang An nodded. “Mo Awu and the rest may have not been engaged in intelligence work before, but they do have their share of experience in intelligence issues as they often had dealings with those intelligence organizations when carrying out their missions in the past. I’m sure they can lay out the foundation so the prototype of the intel network can be formed when Jin Shi catches up there.”</p><p>“True. So off you go, then.”</p><p>Tang Xiu waved and watched her leave the study with flickering eyes. The turmoil between these major companies in the U.S. and the battle between these two super forces would definitely make the world turbulent. This meant that it would also provide a chance for the Tang Sect to fish in troubled waters and reap great benefits.</p><p>Prior to this, the sect’s foundation was really too weak, so he never took any major move. He even had to find ways to avoid the conflict between Tang Sect’s disciples and all the cultivation forces from various countries that went to the waters of Nine Dragons Island then. But now, even though his sect couldn’t be called as powerful, they already had enough capital. If he waited for a few years, he could expect to see the sect’s strength to become much stronger when the outstanding cultivation talents of those children army started to stand out.</p><p>Suddenly, he recalled one thing. It was about Banshou’s team. He never asked them about their cultivation even though they had obtained cultivation arts. He then took out his cell phone and dialed Banshou’s number.</p><p>“It’s me, Banshou.”</p><p>“Any instruction for me, Boss?” Banshou’s voice came from the phone.</p><p>“Where are you now? How is the progress with your cultivation?” asked Tang Xiu.</p><p>Banshou’s dry voice replied, “We have yet to sense the flow of qi so far, Boss. But we’re not losing heart and keep trying hard every day, though. Each of us keeps practicing for at least two hours daily. Ah, that’s right. We’re now on Jingmen Island.”</p><p>“Anyway, it’s been a long time since I ordered you to suspend the adoption of street children before. It’s time for you to start the operation again,” said Tang Xiu.</p><p>“That’s great!”</p><p>Banshou was pleasantly surprised and replied, “We haven’t actually been idle during this time, Boss. Not all of our time has been spending time on cultivation, either. We often move about around the country since we got four teams in total. Also, we found over 100 good children recently, but since you told us to cease adopting them, I only assigned someone to follow and keep watch over them in secret.”</p><p>“Good job,” said Tang Xiu. “There’s another thing I want you to do. I need at least one person in those four teams to be proficient in various languages and someone familiar with some countries abroad.”</p><p>“Do you want us… to extend our search for street children abroad, Boss?” Banshou was surprised.</p><p>“That’s right. But begin the operation in Asia first. You don’t need to recruit many children in each country, just a thousand is enough.”</p><p>“I’m gonna summon everyone right away and get them here to report to you, Boss,” said Banshou excitedly.</p><p>“Tell them to rush to Star City within 2 days!” said Tang Xiu. “I’ll be waiting for them here.”</p><p>After he hung up and was about to leave the study, he suddenly heard a knock on the door and Hao Lei’s voice came outside. “Hao Lei is here to report, Sect Master.”</p><p>“Come in!” Tang Xiu replied.</p><p>As the door opened, Hao Lei and Kang Xia walked into the room. A faint ambiance exuded from the current Hao Lei which was clearly an aura caused by the internal energy of mid-stage Golden Core.</p><p>“Not bad.”</p><p>Tang Xiu nodded at her and then took out another interspatial ring from his ring. He then handed it over to Hao Lei. “These are the articles to be auctioned. Drop your blood first for ring ownership and have a look at them.”</p><p>Hao Lei nodded and took the ring. Not long after she followed Tang Xiu’s order to drop her blood on it, her beautiful face looked dull with disbelief in her eyes.</p><p>She was truly shocked!</p><p>She never dreamed that Tang Xiu could provide so many treasures. Not to mention the pieces of jewelry, she could tell in just a glance that these hundreds of antiques and curios were quite valuable treasures.</p><p>“Sell all of these goods in the one-off auction,” said Tang Xiu. “Additionally, I need you to set up a large auction house; I think the best place for it is in Shanghai. I gave you 1 billion yuan for promotional funds before, and I’ll give you 5 billion more to set up this auction house.”</p><p>Hao Lei thought for a moment and slowly replied, “We must have an exclusive building that belongs to us if you want to establish an auction house, Sect Master. I’m not talking about leasing a few floors in some edifice, but a building that is completely ours. The other urgent things also include the auctioneers and fixed staffers, along with security personnel; security must be the top priority given the value of the objects stored in the auction house.”</p><p>“I won’t bother dealing with these aspects, so I’m giving you full authority to manage them.” Tang Xiu said, “Also, I’m going to contact Xiaoxue later to ask her to transfer a group of experts from the sect to assist you.”</p><p>Hao Lei hesitated for a moment before nodding. “Then, I’ll do my best.”</p><p>****</p><p>As dusk came and the red glowing blob dyed the sky red, a cold wind began blowing to every corner of Star City and brought certain footage to the hands of several hundreds of forces. The 10-minute-long video, however, caused a great stir, and these forces kept sending the video around the world through the internet.</p><p>Beijing, the HQ of the Special Abilities Bureau.</p><p>Duanmu Lin, who just had dinner, was talking to Zhu Long about the demonic beasts’ issue in the Himalayas when a thin young man quickly rushed into the room and passed a tablet PC, reporting. “Chief, we just received stirring footage from Star City!”</p><p><em>Star City?</em></p><p>Duanmu Lin frowned and, after taking the tablet, asked, “Where’s Tang Xiu?”</p><p>“He’s in Star City,” the young man replied.</p><p>Duanmu Lin shook his head and forced a wry smile. “This brat is truly talented in stirring things up. He always stirs up major events no matter where he goes. Just like the turmoil in Japan some time ago, which was caused by him going there. I suspect that this incident is also one of his crafts. Alas… let’s watch the footage first. I hope this brat didn’t make a mess excessively.”</p><p>“But Chief, the content of the video has nothing to do with Mr. Tang, although I’m sure that he’s deeply related to the incident if we dig further,” said the young man. “Accurately speaking, it’s inseparable from his company, the Magnificent Tang Corporation.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
