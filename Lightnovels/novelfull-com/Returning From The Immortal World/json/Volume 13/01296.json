With You Zhong in tandem, it took them only 10 seconds to kill the last three Celestial Immortals.</p><p>As the Star Devourer Insect turned into a streak of light and re-entered Tang Xiu’s body, Tang Xiu’s gaze shifted to Gu Yan’er’s fight in the distance. He was still too weak to help her, but he was relieved after seeing that she had killed one of the two Clearwater Clan’s Golden Immortals. The other Golden Immortal was struggling to fight back and could be killed by Gu Yan’er at any time.</p><p>He didn’t notice that You Zhong, who didn’t seem to feel anything that his body was full of wounds, was staring at him with a stunned expression at this moment.</p><p>You Zhong was flabbergasted. He had been watching the fight all the time. Aside from the last strike unleashed by Darknorth Immortal that killed a Profound Immortal and two Celestial Immortals, he saw the other eight Celestial Immortals besiege Tang Xiu, two of whom were devoured by a bizarre insect creature, and Tang Xiu killed the rest. Even counting the bizarre insect as a helper, such performance was too dazzling.</p><p>Further, there were still those three Celestial Immortals who besieged him, two of whom died in Tang Xiu’s hand. Meaning that Tang Xiu killed 8 Celestial Immortals during the whole fight. Such combat power was simply terrifying. It must be noted that he just crossed his Immortal Tribulation and became an Immortal!</p><p>Leaping over such cultivation levels and going for the kill. Moreover, he jumped two levels for the kill. Such a feat was something that You Zhong only heard from the legends. It was his first time encountering it in reality in thousands of years. Recalling that he harbored some contempt when this fella gave him some instructions, You Zhong couldn’t help but feel ashamed inwardly.</p><p>If he were to break through to the Earth Immortal Stage, wouldn’t he be able to devastate those at the Celestial Immortal Stage as easily as killing a chicken? If he were to break through to the Celestial Immortal Stage, he may be able to ruthlessly slaughter those at the Profound Immortal Stage, no? Going higher, if he were to advance to the Profound Immortal Stage, that means even those at the Golden Immortal Stage…</p><p>The shock made You Zhong shudder inwardly. The way he looked at Tang Xiu was now full of enthusiasm.</p><p>Suddenly, his mind recalled something and he quickly turned to look towards the battle not far away. He saw the last Golden Immortal of Clearwater Clan being killed by Gu Yan’er, and she was now flying in this direction.</p><p>“Are you alright, Master?” Gu Yan’er came to Tang Xiu, intimately pulled Tang Xiu’s hands and asked.</p><p>Tang Xiu smiled slightly in response and said, “A few Celestial Immortal nobodies can’t pose too much threat to me. What about you? You actually killed them in such a short time, you should’ve restored your strength to the last-stage Golden Immortal, right?</p><p>“I may have lost all my immortal artifacts and am unable to cast many spells and divine abilities as powerful as before, but it’s still easy to deal with some weak Golden Immortals with my current cultivation level. Even if we run into some Perfected Golden Immortals, I’m still confident that I can escape with you, Master,” Gu Yan’er replied with a smile.</p><p>Even though Tang Xiu knew that Gu Yan’er was once regarded as a fearsome female devil in the Immortal World, he rarely ran into occasions where he witnessed her taking action, to begin with. But after this fight, he must admit that he had to look at her with a new outlook. Back when he advanced to the Golden Immortal Stage, wasn’t he also capable of doing what Gu Yan’er just did?</p><p>“Thank you for coming to our rescue, two immortal friends. This Everblithe is truly grateful. The three of you are my Aurelian Artificer Sect’s benefactors from now on.” The fully scarred ancestor of the Aurelian Artificer Sect caught up. The fearsome power showcased by Gu Yan’er gave him a shock, but he felt much more grateful inwardly due to that. He was well aware that had it not been for the sudden rescue of these three people, he and Darknorth Immortal would have kicked the bucket today.</p><p>Tang Xiu’s eyes glinted with surprise. He carefully observed the old Golden Immortal who called himself “Everblithe” and asked, “My elder had some intersections with the Aurelian Artificer Sect in the past. Are you a disciple of the same generation as Everglyph in the Aurelian Artificer Sect?”</p><p>Darknorth Everblithe was surprised. “I’m indeed a disciple of the same generation as Everglyph in the sect. May I know who the elder of Fellow Immortal is?”</p><p>“You should know about the ‘Golden Forge Heavenly Scripture’, right? My elder once mentioned it to me that he came to this Immortal Domain several thousands of years ago by chance and also left some immortal karma here.”</p><p>The Golden Forge Heavenly Scripture?</p><p>Darknorth Everblithe’s eyes instantly turned saucer as disbelief overflowed in his eyes. He was still wary and guarding against Tang Xiu’s group of three a moment ago. But after the name was mentioned, his wariness vanished without a trace, replaced by deep elation and gratitude.</p><p>The main reason why his Aurelian Artificer Sect was able to become a renowned powerful faction in this Immortal Domain was exactly due to their monumental work of art—the Golden Forge Heavenly Scripture for immortal artifact refining—a masterpiece regarded as a treasure by his sect. This masterpiece came from a mysterious powerhouse several thousands of years ago, who exchanged it with some refining materials obtained by his sect.</p><p>“Immortal friend, are you… a junior of that Senior?” Darknorth Everblithe was so excited that his breathing turned slightly faster and he asked expectantly.</p><p>“Only a few people in the Immortal World know about this ‘Golden Forge Heavenly Scripture’. Nobody else knows ever since my elder told me about it several millennia ago. Do you think I’m lying to you?”</p><p>“No, no. I don’t dare.” Darknorth Everblithe excitedly said, “I was just an Earth Immortal several thousands of years ago. My status was too low to even be able to meet such a noble Senior at that time. But it’s been my regret for millennia, regardless. I really never thought that I’d be so lucky to run into a descendant of that Senior today! May I know your honorable name, Immortal friend?”</p><p>“I’m the Great Tang Heavenly Emperor,” Tang Xiu replied with a smile.</p><p>Darknorth Everblithe was slightly stunned and a slightly strange feeling appeared in his heart. It must be noted that those who dared to use the “Heavenly Emperor” or “Great Emperor” titles in the entire Immortal World were those super-powerful powerhouses who had reached the Supremacy Stage. A few Perfected Golden Immortals also used such titles, but they were all fearsome and terrifying figures that were nearly comparable to those Supremes.</p><p>But this brat in front him who seemed to not have reached the Earth Immortal Stage really had the guts to call himself the “Great Tang Heavenly Emperor”? Was he not afraid of being laughed at?</p><p>Darknorth Everblithe could only laugh inwardly and then said, “Well, Great Tang… Heavenly Emperor… that’s quite a wonderfully prestigious name. Anyway, Sect Master and I went out this time to catch some Firecloud Cicada. We never expected to run into these Clearwater Clan’s people. They concealed their evil intention with their amiable look and offered to join us. But then they attacked us when we were unprepared. But the three fellows, fortunately, came to our rescue in the nick of time. This grace will always be remembered in our hearts. By the way, may I ask where are three fellows heading to?”</p><p>Tang Xiu turned around and made a gesture to Gu Yan’er. After watching her quickly search for the interspatial ring carried by the Clearwater Clan’s people, he then turned around and said, “Those Firecloud Cicadas are also our goal, to be honest. We’d like to catch some of them to refine some Versicolor Coral Garbs when we get back.”</p><p>Darknorth Everblithe stared blankly for a moment. Then, he immediately let out a forced smile and said, “If it weren’t for me and Sect Master being injured, we could’ve offered our help to you. But we…”</p><p>“What about the healing elixirs you carry?” Tang Xiu interrupted him and asked.</p><p>“We’ve already taken all of them,” Darknorth Everblithe said.</p><p>Tang Xiu pondered for a moment and then asked again, “By the way, do you have some Chiba Grass, Evermore Toadstools, Blood Hazelnuts, and Snow Phoenix Dews?”</p><p>Darknorth Everblithe immediately nodded. “Except for the Snow Phoenix Dew, which is a precious Spirit Liquid, the other three are just common medicinal herbs. I happen to have them here.”</p><p>After asking Darknorth Everblithe for four kinds of pill concocting materials, Tang Xiu hinted at the old man to check Darknorth Immortal’s injuries. While under the protection of Gu Yan’er who just returned, he then took out the Demon God Soul Devourer Cauldron and began to concoct Springtime Elixir. This elixir was easy to concoct with average efficacy, though it still had a very good healing efficacy for Immortals under the Golden Immortal Stage. Certainly, the elixir was several times more potent than the Holy Healing pills Tang Xiu had refined before.</p><p>Upon seeing that Tang Xiu was about to concoct some pills, Darknorth Everblithe was slightly surprised inward, but he still moved fast to the spot where Darknorth Immortal was recuperating. After doing a diagnosis, he was relieved to see that Darknorth Immortal’s life was not in danger though his injuries were too severe. He just suffered from over-drafting his Immortal Force.</p><p>In a flash, three days passed. As Tang Xiu cast the Pill Assimilation incantation, the lid of the Demon God Soul Devourer Cauldron suddenly floated up and tens of crystal-clear Springtime Elixirs floated out of the tripod. Tang Xiu quickly took out a jade bottle and stuffed them inside.</p><p>During these three days, You Zhong had been waiting nearby. He thought that Tang Xiu only had a scant knowledge in alchemy and just wanted to concoct some healing elixirs to spend some time. However, the moment the cauldron lid was opened and he saw those tens of crystal-clear elixirs and smelled their rich medicine scent when they floated out from the cauldron, his eyeballs bulged out and nearly popped out from their sockets.</p><p>Those were Springtime Elixirs—a very previous healing elixir! Who could afford such a healing elixir except those from super forces?</p><p>Further, something thing that made You Zhong fall apart was the scene of the Springtime Elixir concoction process itself. How could it be possible to successfully refine dozens of elixirs at a time? For information, this guy had just advanced to the Immortal Stage. He was not even an Earth Immortal yet, for God’s sake!</p><p>Looking similarly as shocked as You Zhong was the ancestor of the Aurelian Artificer Sect, Darknorth Everblithe. He had seen many Pill Masters concoct pills and elixirs, but he had never seen such a freak who only needed a small number of medicinal materials, yet was able to refine tens of Springtime Elixirs.</p><p>Darknorth Everblithe watched Tang Xiu put away the furnace before he came floating in front of him and hesitantly said, “Great Tang Fellow Immortal, what you just concocted was the Springtime Elixir, right? But as far as this elixir is concerned, I’ve never seen anyone use so few medicinal materials yet was able to concoct so many of them…”</p><p>Tang Xiu lifted his hand to interrupt him and threw 10 Springtime Elixir to him. Afterward, he slightly smiled and said, “Take these elixirs. You’ll know whether they’re Springtime Elixirs or not after taking it.”</p><p>Darknorth Evertblithe hesitated, then took one. As he felt a potent efficacy from the medicine, not only did his expression slightly shifted, but he also nodded and said, “This is indeed the Springtime Elixir. Further, it’s a mid-grade one. The attainments of Fellow Immortal Great Tang in alchemy have exceeded my knowledge. Truly admirable!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
