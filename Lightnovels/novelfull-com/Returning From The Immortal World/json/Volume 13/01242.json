He was just 17-years-old and finished all the curriculums from primary school to high school in five years. He was a genius who had an amazing memory and fast comprehension ability.</p><p>He could understand the meaning behind Tang Xiu’s line. In ancient times, it was said that a Master for a day was a father for a lifetime. A Master was not a teacher, nor was the one who received a batch of students and then sent them off later. One who became a Master was like a family, or rather a father, thus, a Master and his or her disciples had inseparable bond in the truest sense.</p><p>“Then I’ll give it my best!” A firm look was shown on Ah Lang’s face.</p><p>“An hour is 60 minutes, and four minutes have already passed.” Tang Xiu smiled. “You only have 56 minutes left.”</p><p>Ah Lang’s face slightly changed. He immediately took a seat and immersed himself in memorizing the content of the Soul, Heart, and Spirit Cultivation art manual.</p><p>However, he looked a bit overjoyed after a few minutes passed. He found that his memory now worked better than before. He needed a great deal of effort to memorize the book he read before, but he could now read much faster with just a glance. He found his memory kept working better in memorizing and continuously grew much sharper. He could even easily memorize the content just by skimming.</p><p>My brain works much better now.</p><p>Ah Lang also wanted to understand this aspect more, so he immediately focused his mind and concentrated on reading more. 40 minutes later, he finally finished reading the last word on the manual and recited all the contents in his mind. There were only a few parts he hadn’t fully memorized, so he read the manual again. Afterward, he closed the manual and said, “I’ve read all of them.”</p><p>“Have you fully memorized them?” Tang Xiu asked.</p><p>Ah Lang nodded. “I can recite the entire content now.”</p><p>Tang Xiu nodded in approval with a smile. Then, he walked to the broken chair in the room and took a seat. He shook his head and said, “No need to recite it! I’ve been here for a long time and transformed your body too. Now I’m thirsty.”</p><p>“I’ll serve the tea for you.”</p><p>Ah Lang turned around. But after he paced a few steps, an overjoyed look overflowed in his eyes. He quickly poured a cup of tea and hastily came back to Tang Xiu and directly knelt on the floor while offering the teacup with both hands. “Please have tea, Master.”</p><p>Tang Xiu received the teacup. He didn’t rush to drink it but smilingly said, “It’s still missing from formally a swearing-in to acknowledge a Master. But well, it’s close enough.”</p><p>Then, Ah Lang knocked his head thrice before looking up at Tang Xiu.</p><p>Tang Xiu happily nodded to him in response. He sipped the hot tea with a smile. He then propped up the boy from the floor and asked, “What’s your surname?”</p><p>“I and my three brothers have no surname, Master.” Ah Lang shook his head.</p><p>“I’ve heard a bit about your situation. Now, tell me about yourself.”</p><p>“There’s nothing worth to tell about, Master.” Ah Lang bitterly said, “I had three brothers, and two of them died when I was still small, whereas my first brother is now in prison, in which he may have to stay there for life. As a matter of fact, they are not my blood brothers; even those brothers closest to me never knew the true relationship between the four of us.”</p><p>“Continue!” Tang Xiu nodded.</p><p>“The four of us lived in the orphanage before and we were all abandoned as infants.” Ah Lang went on, “Later on, the person in that orphanage abused us all day. First Brother and Second Brother then took us to escape secretly, but the youngest sister died shortly after we escaped, leaving only the four of us, brothers. Afterward, we kept fighting and struggling with others for food and to get some money. Second and Third Brothers were then killed by some people, whereas First Brother went to jail.”</p><p>Tang Xiu nodded slowly and thoughtfully said, “What did your First Brother do to make him go to prison?”</p><p>Hatred flashed in Ah Lang’s eyes before he replied, “He took revenge for the Second and Third Brothers. But the fact is, those who killed those bastards were me, Wang Hu, and Wang Long. First Brother took all the crimes on his own shoulders to avoid all of us going to prison.”</p><p>“In which prison is your First Brother detained?” asked Tang Xiu again.</p><p>“Qinchuan Prison.”</p><p>Tang Xiu took out his cell phone and dialed Zhu Long’s cell number, saying, “I need to take someone out from Qinchuan Prison. He’s just a civilian, but his brother is my disciple who will follow me in the future. Report my request to Duanmu Lin and ask his approval to release this man.”</p><p>“Got it!” Zhu Long curtly replied and directly hung up. It didn’t take long before the man called back.</p><p>“How was it?” Tang Xiu asked after picking up the call.</p><p>“Director Duanmu has replied that it’s fine. On the condition that the person you just mentioned doesn’t stay in China and best not to make any major disturbances again later. Also, Aquababe has left for Qinchuan Prison. Shall I contact her to send the person to you directly, or are you going to pick him up in person?”</p><p>Tang Xiu looked at Ah Lang and asked, “What’s your brother’s name?”</p><p>“Ah Dong,” Ah Lang answered.</p><p>“His full name,” Tang Xiu said.</p><p>“Just Ah Dong. The ID issued by the government for us in our class before only had Ah Lang and Ah Long.”</p><p>Tang Xiu wryly smiled and spoke to Zhu Long again, “I’m currently not far from Qinchuan Prison, so I’m going to pick him up myself. Please contact Aquababe in advance that I’m waiting for her there!”</p><p>Tang Xiu put away his mobile phone and shifted to the excited-looking Ah Lang. He lightly smiled and said, “I’m giving you another opportunity since you have no family name. If you can cultivate up to the Golden Core Stage within 2 years, I’ll bestow you my family name.”</p><p>“Tang?”</p><p>Ah Lang’s eyes lit up. He resolutely nodded and said, “I’ll do my best to not betray your expectation, Master. You… can you really bail out my brother from prison?”</p><p>Tang Xiu smiled lightly in response and replied, “We’re going to Qinchuan Prison tonight to pick him up. But there’s something I want you to do before that.”</p><p>“Master, this should be about these brothers of mine, right?” asked Ah Lang.</p><p>“It’s really easy to speak with you. Well, that’s a likable good point of smart people.” Tang Xiu chuckled. “You’re right. You chose to follow me, but what about them? Do you want me to take them all with you, or do you want them to stay? Of course, I’ll give each one of them a sum of money. The amount may not be big, but it should be enough for each of them to live for more than 10 years.”</p><p>“I’d like to bring them with me if I may, Master.” Ah Lang replied, “They will be very sad if I’m the only one who leaves with you.”</p><p>Tang Xiu nodded and said, “If so, we’ll take them together. But before that, you must ask their opinions first and ask whether they want to go with you.”</p><p>“Understood!”</p><p>Outside the room.</p><p>Wang Hu and Wang Long were standing restlessly outside the door with eyes staring at the door. Although they couldn’t see anything, they hoped that they could at least hear something from the inside.</p><p>“What the hell is going on there, Brother? Has Divine Doctor Tang finished treating Ah Lang?” asked Wang Long anxiously yet again.</p><p>Wang Hu scowled at him with a vexed expression. “You ask me, but whom I must ask then? I have no idea what’s going on there, either. I don’t even get how I got inexplicably thrown out all of a sudden. No… it was just a flash… I was standing next to Ah Lang, but then I inexplicably got pushed outside by something like the wind in the next moment.”</p><p>Wang Long looked at him with a face visibly saying that he didn’t buy it. However, he didn’t say more and just felt that his big brother lost his mind. Else, he wouldn’t have uttered such nonsensical things.</p><p>Wang Hu kept trying to move forward and exclaimed, “What on Earth is going on here? We keep trying to rush inside so many times but we can’t get in. How come we get bounced back again and again?”</p><p>Creak…</p><p>The door was opened from the inside and the fresh-looking Ah Lang came out with a beaming face. When he saw Wang Hu and Wang Long, he said aloud, “Ah Hu, Ah Long, you both call all the brothers immediately and tell them to gather here right away. Tell ’em that they must be here within half an hour.”</p><p>“How are you feeling now, Ah Lang?” Wang Long dashed and asked aloud.</p><p>Wang Hu, on the other hand, wore a strange expression when he saw Ah Lang. He clearly saw how sick Ah Lang was before that he even coughed up a mouthful of blood in front of him. Why… how come he got… much better in just a short time? Could it be that Divine Doctor Tang really had a miraculous elixir that cured his illness and made him better instantly?</p><p>“What happened, Ah Lang?”</p><p>Ah Lang stretched his hand, gripped his fists and exclaimed, “I’ve been cured and I’m fine now! Tell all the brothers to come here quickly!”</p><p>“Got it!”</p><p>Ah Hu was overjoyed and immediately grabbed his cell phone to call the others.</p><p>Tang Xiu came out of the room and looked at the three boys with a smile on his face, sighing inwardly. He had been young himself, yet he never had such life-and-death brothers. Back when he just arrived in the Immortal World, even those around him were a bunch off silk pants who only knew to pick up troubles and did all kinds of mischievous things. But when it came to dangers, they were the perfect representation of those who fled instantly when facing a calamity.</p><p>Maybe those in Su Family Village were my good brothers when I was a kid, right? But they are also… barely. Tang Xiu secretly forced a wry smile after making a comparison.</p><p>Less than an hour later, over 200 youths had all arrived. Just from this aspect, Tang Xiu could tell how remarkable was Ah Lang’s band of brothers.</p><p>Watching them cry, laugh, and how the group profusely thanked him, the crack that had long existed in his heart slowly closed up. Eventually, he was finally able to melt some of the frigid wariness he always had toward the so-called brotherhood and friendship.</p><p>Night finally fell.</p><p>Aside from Ah Lang, 228 boys and girls had gathered outside the house and all of them focused their attention on Tang Xiu with anticipation on their faces.</p><p>They had heard about two issues from Ah Lang.</p><p>The first one was that there was someone who had expressed the intention of adopting them. From now on, they didn’t need to wander about and roam everywhere just to keep on living, and there was no need for them to do any hard labor work to earn money.</p><p>The second one was about Ah Dong, their big brother who was now in prison. This great benefactor also extended his hand to free him, and they could meet him again soon.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
