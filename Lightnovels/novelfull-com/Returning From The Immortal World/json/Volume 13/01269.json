He could easily check Chen Liwei’s memory as the man himself looked to be in pain. But Tang Xiu’s expression became more indifferent the longer he scoured Chen Liwei’s memory, and his expression finally turned into that of anger.</p><p>“You’re really damned!”</p><p>Tang Xiu’s five fingers pinched hard and directly cracked Chen Liwei’s skull, and a punch finally ended the man’s life. After seeing his memories, Tang Xiu knew how wicked and sinister this man had been. Aside from being ambitious, he had a good reputation overseas before joining the Magnificent Tang Corporation, yet he resorted to many underhanded and despicable means to achieve it. Since he joined the Magnificent Tang Corp, he continued climbing up in position using various wicked and sinister means and finally became the no.2 figure in the company.</p><p>In Scarface Qiang’s case, he was framed and schemed by Chen Liwei, since the man secretly contacted him to embezzle a batch of God’s Nectar to sell through private channels for personal gain. Scarface Qiang refused and severely reprimanded him and went so far to strike him.</p><p>Therefore, Chen Liwei harbored a grudge towards Scarface Qiang. Through a series of machinations, he finally forced Scarface Qiang to leave the Magnificent Tang Corporation and Chen Liwei put his trusted man on the position of the director of the winery. For the last six months, Chen Liwei secretly embezzled God’s Nectar and then sold it through special private channels and pocketed the money.</p><p>The fortune from just half a year of selling the stolen God’s Nectar alone earned him more than 100 million yuan.</p><p>Further, he had also begun to set up a machination to get his hands on the Aeroglider. Had Tang Xiu not come here at this time and met him because of Scarface Qiang’s case, it was very likely that the man would be able to put his lackey to be the director of the Aeroglider plant in the next few months. He would then embezzle Aerogliders for his own personal gain.</p><p>“So bold and greedy!”</p><p>Tang Xiu kicked Chen Liwei’s body away and then stared daggers at the frightened Gao Beilei, who got up from the sofa and kept retreating backward. Then, he coldly said, “I originally said that I’ll give you 10% stakes of the company if you could manage the company well. Yet you’ve picked up and groomed some crooks inside the company—that deserves punishment. As such, you can only get at most 5% of the company stakes 2 years later!”</p><p>As Gao Beilei’s came to a halt, she stared at Tang Xiu with a look of horror and panickily said, “W-why… w-why did you kill him?”</p><p>“Kill him, huh? He already got it easy to just die rather than being at the border of life and death!” Tang Xiu sneered. “The one now in charge of the winery is Chen Liwei’s dog, and he has been secretly abusing his power to embezzle God’s Nectar and selling it to seek personal gain for the last six months. That alone earned him more than 100 million yuan. What’s more, he also began his machination at the Aeroglider factory to plant his man as the factory director, with which he planned to further grow his fortune. It’s just been less than 3 years for God’s sake! Do you know how much money he got from his corruption in the company?”</p><p>“How is this possible?” Gao Beilei incredulously asked.</p><p>“Heh, I looked into his memories. How could it be wrong?” Tang Xiu sneered.</p><p>“That’s nonsense!” Gao Beilei shuddered and subconsciously stepped back. “How can you look into Chen Liwei’s memories? You…”</p><p>Her words came to a halt.</p><p>A horrified and frightened look painted her face as though she was seeing a ghost in the daytime. She saw Tang Xiu, who was previously sitting, float. Not only that, but even all the objects in the office were also floating.</p><p>“Do you know why I can easily create the Magnificent Tang Corporation and why it has been so easy for me to make so much fortune?” Tang Xiu sneered. “It’s because I’ve never been an ordinary person. I already told you that I don’t give a damn about money, didn’t I? Money has never been a significant thing for me. Gao Beilei, you being able to become the General Manager of the Magnificent Tang Corporation and someone who can call the shots in the Wall Street before, you should know about many things. Don’t tell me you never heard anything about practitioners?”</p><p>Whoosh…</p><p>As Tang Xiu faded away at this moment, a figure suddenly appeared in the room. A crooked and relatively young man silently appeared in front of Gao Beilei and looked at Tang Xiu with vigilance, ready to protect Gao Beilei.</p><p>Tang Xiu creased his brows and lightly smiled. “Well, well. It seems you know about the existence of practitioners. This subordinate of yours is seemingly one, and a rather formidable one as well!”</p><p>Gao Beilei only felt that a gale was whooshing before her eyes a moment ago, and her bodyguard appeared in front of her in a flash. The situation turned chaotic given how unbelievable it was to her. The existence of practitioners was something she only heard from some rumors, but she had no idea what kind of abilities they possessed.</p><p>Her bodyguard was a poor man she helped during her stay in the United States. At that time, the man was injured and she rescued him. After this young man recovered, he showcased his combat prowess and thus kept following her.</p><p>Yet… she really had no idea that he was a practitioner!</p><p>“What’s exactly going on here, Reese? Why did you suddenly appear in front of me in a flash? You… are you really like what he said… a p-practitioner?” Gao Beilei suppressed her panic and fright and quickly asked.</p><p>The young man turned his head and squeezed out a smile that was uglier than crying, saying, “I’m indeed a practitioner, Boss. I used to think that I’m already formidable enough. But I’m worlds apart compared to him.”</p><p>“You do have a bit of self-knowledge, huh?” Tang Xiu indifferently smiled.</p><p>Having said that, he gently waved his hand. The young man’s body was instantly bounced off and quickly hit the wall, and he couldn’t move anymore. A strand of qi swept Gao Beilei and threw her back on the opposite sofa. Tang Xiu then went on saying, “Killings are just normal occurrence among cultivators, your subordinate is well aware of this fact. Although I have no idea why he concealed his identity as a practitioner, he’s your subordinate, so I won’t kill him. Still, the Magnificent Tang Corporation is mine, and the appearance of such a wicked tumor like Chen Liwei requires me to act to remove it.”</p><p>Gao Beilei gradually put away the fear in her heart. She stared at Tang Xiu and asked, “Can I… resign?”</p><p>“I’ll neither stop nor keep from resigning,” Tang Xiu calmly said. “At most, I just feel a bit regretful. However, the protection Kang Xia put on you will be withdrawn?”</p><p>“Kang Xia? Protection?” Gao Beilei was confused and asked, “What do you mean by that?”</p><p>“You guys, come out!” Tang Xiu clapped and lightly said.</p><p>Suddenly, two men and two women appeared in the office out of the blue. The four people quickly saluted and respectfully said, “Your Majesty.”</p><p>“You guys should have been protecting Gao Beilei’s safety in the past few years, right?” Tang Xiu nodded at them and said, “Thanks for your hard work. But you guys don’t need to stay to protect her anymore if she insists on resigning later.”</p><p>“Acknowledged!” the four people respectfully replied.</p><p>Tang Xiu pondered for a moment before he took a pen and paper and quickly wrote more than 20 people’s names. Afterward, he threw it one of them and ordered, “Go to the winery and dispose of its director! Give the people on the list severe beatings as well and squeeze them to find out how much they have embezzled from the Corporation for their personal gain all these years. Drag them out and dispose them afterward!”</p><p>“Affirmative!” the four replied and instantly disappeared.</p><p>With disbelief on her face, Gao Beilei murmured, “They… they have been protecting me secretly for the last 3 years?”</p><p>“That’s right,” Tang Xiu calmly replied. “That’s why I said that Kang Xia has been taking care of you. Those four were originally her bodyguards, but she unexpectedly ordered them to protect you after she left. Nevertheless, it’s natural. After all, you’re the Magnificent Tang Corporation’s General Manager and responsible to manage the whole operation of the company. If even your security is not guaranteed, that will affect the company’s development for sure.”</p><p>Gao Beilei took a deep breath and dispelled all the fears in her heart, and then stated in a deep voice, “I can choose not to resign, but there’s a question I need you to answer.”</p><p>“You want to ask me who I really am, don’t you?” Tang Xiu smiled and lightly replied.</p><p>“Yes.” Gao Beilei nodded.</p><p>Tang Xiu retracted his aura and let go of the young man pasted on the wall. Then, he chuckled and asked him, “You should have heard of Chinese cultivators, right?”</p><p>The young man dashed to Gao Beilei and replied with a respectful face, “I know about the mysterious Chinese cultivators, and their cultivation system is even more unfathomable. If she didn’t come to China and become the Magnificent Tang Corporation’s General Manager, I wouldn’t have dared come to China at all. So much so that I have never exposed my identity as a practitioner and kept staying low-key ever since I arrived in China 2 years ago.”</p><p>“You have any more questions?” Tang Xiu looked at Gao Beilein and chuckled.</p><p>Gao Beilei finally understood Tang Xiu’s identity. She also had heard of the existence of cultivators in China. However, she only regarded it as some fairy tale and thought it was impossible for real cultivators to exist in reality. But now that her worldview had been overturned, she realized that she had been a frog that saw a sky from the bottom of a well—lacking in knowledge and ignorant.</p><p>Suddenly, her expression shifted and she inquisitively asked, “If I did not hear wrong, they addressed you as Your Majesty. You…”</p><p>“You’d better not ask such things as you’re not qualified to know anything about it.” Tang Xiu lightly smiled. “What you need to know is that I’m not hostile to you. I’ll never harm you for no reason as long as you don’t harm my interests. What you need to do is to develop the Magnificent Tang Corporation well, with which you’ll help me make more money in the next two years.”</p><p>Gao Beilei creased her brows and asked, “I may take your statement for granted and be convinced if you’re now the richest person in the world. But why do you still urgently need to make more money? Didn’t you say that money has no much significance to you no matter how much it is?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
