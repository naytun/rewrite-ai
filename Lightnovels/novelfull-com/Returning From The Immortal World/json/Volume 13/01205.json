The Mayor and some people from Harbo Group came to my residence when I was on the way to your house, so I’m going to deal with them first and wait for your arrival there.”</p><p>“Alright!” Tang Xiu felt relieved and set the man out of the house with a smile on his face.</p><p>As he returned back to the living room on the first floor, he saw that Andy had come out of the kitchen still in an apron. But seeing her delicate and cute face now had some black screens “make-up” from pot bottom, he was unable to hold his laughter. She looked so distressed at this time.</p><p>‘Hehe, not like someone who can cook, indeed.’</p><p>Tang Xiu chuckled inwardly, but he kept a still and calm face on the surface. “How good of you to proactively prepare breakfast, Andy. Did you just finish cooking? I’m starving.”</p><p>Andy glanced at Kang Xia and then stammered. “B-Boss, d-did you mean it when you promised that?”</p><p>“I may not be an emperor, but I always mean what I say.” Tang Xiu nodded.</p><p>After hearing this, Andy immediately continued, “Kang Xia said that I must be able to handle both the main duty and kitchen work if I want to be your woman. She also said that you’ll agree to let me be your woman if I can cook. So what I’m asking is, did you really mean what you said?”</p><p>Tang Xiu turned to look at Kang Xia and saw her nodding to him smilingly. Then, he slowly replied, “I’ve tasted lots of delicacies and its kind and I just can’t wolf down any ordinary meals anymore. Well, I just lost my appetite since you can’t cook, though.”</p><p>“What do you know I can’t cook?” Andy acted angrily and shouted, “You haven’t tasted it yet!”</p><p>Tang Xiu stared dully for a moment and then carefully observed her expression for a short while. After seeing the anxiousness and fear in her erratically moving eyes, he said, “I’ll consider it if the meal you made tastes great. If it’s just ordinary, you’d better listen to Kang Xia’s arrangement to have some blind dates and find yourself a boyfriend fast.”</p><p>“I don’t think Andy will just give up if you don’t give her a sure statement, Boss.” Kang Xia interrupted. “Besides, you don’t want to be entangled the whole time in the future, right?”</p><p>Tang Xiu gave it a thought and felt that Kang Xia was right. However, he was still not quite assured and then released his spiritual sense to check the dining room. There, he found four dishes had been served on the dining table. But the “sight” made him amused inwardly since the appearances of these dishes were truly appalling, especially that fish-like dish. That particular dish was obviously overcooked given how dark the fish skin was.</p><p>“I agree to accept you if the dishes you just made taste great, Andy. But if they taste bad and are not my standard, you’re not to mention it anymore in the future since we are not fated, alright?” said Tang Xiu seriously.</p><p>“About that… alright. Deal!”</p><p>Andy turned around with a pitiful expression on her face. But her expression turned into a blooming flower-like smiling face when Tang Xiu couldn’t see it clearly. Even her footsteps looked unusually vigorous. After coming to the dining room with Tang Xiu and Kang Xia, she poured the hotpot soup from the casserole and gave a bowl of rice to Tang Xiu and Kang Xia each. After sitting across them, she said, “Eat it and then say what it tastes like.”</p><p>Kang Xia picked up chopsticks with a beaming face and chuckled when she clamped the chopped veggie dish. “Well, I’m gonna act as a witness here, so my comment on the taste will definitely be genuine and fair.”</p><p>Having said that, she pinched a piece of spicy and sour shredded potato. The moment after, a curved arc sketched on the corner of her mouth as she looked at Tang Xiu and said, “Well, this shredded potato… tastes pretty good.”</p><p>Tang Xiu rolled his eyes at her in response and used his chopsticks to clamp the said spicy and sour shredded potato. But a short while after, his expression instantly froze after chewing it.</p><p>‘The flavor… tastes good.’</p><p>Despite having tasted lots of delicacies of various kinds, he must admit that this spicy and sour shredded potato did have a great flavor.</p><p>After he swallowed the potato dish, he maintained a calm face and went to pick another dish.</p><p>“How was it? How was the flavor?” asked Andy hurriedly.</p><p>“I just tasted a bite from one dish, so I’m holding my comment for now, alright?” said Tang Xiu. “I’ll give you my full evaluation after I’m done tasting them all.”</p><p>Andy and Kang Xia reacted in a similar fashion and immediately wore smiling faces.</p><p>Shortly after, Tang Xiu tasted the sweet and sour pork ribs, steamed egg flower fish, and the sweet and sour carp one. But after he finished tasting those three dishes, a regretful expression was evident on his face.</p><p>I just got wrecked into the pit, huh…</p><p>That was what he groaned inwardly and the most powerless groan he had ever had. At this time, he really couldn’t understand why Kang Xia put forward that stupid and awful idea to make him fall into this trap.</p><p>Each of these four dishes could be said to deserve a place as the best main course if they were served in those star-rated big restaurants. Despite having tasted various kinds of delicious dishes himself, he still had to admit that Andy’s cooking level was truly above the roof.</p><p>Kang Xia put down her chopsticks and smilingly said, “Alright, lemme state my evaluation first. I think Andy’s dishes taste great despite their appalling looks. I don’t think some great chefs can make it more delicious.”</p><p>Tang Xiu’s mouth twitched twice and was at a loss of how to respond for a while.</p><p>Andy herself looked expectant. She stared at Tang Xiu and asked, “You haven’t given your evaluation yet, Boss!”</p><p>Tang Xiu took a deep breath and reluctantly asked, “Andy, have you really never had your hands on cooking before?”</p><p>While wearing an innocent face, Andy looked back at him with her big watery and intelligent eyes. “I did some cooking before! I also hold a special chef’s license myself and I’ve studied lots of Chinese dishes recipes and made lots of delicious dishes based on them. Ah, that’s right. I used to be a 3-star chef at the Michelin before.”</p><p>“I…”</p><p>Tang Xiu’s mouth was opened as he was heavily suppressed by the devastating blow brought by Andy’s remarks.</p><p>“KANG XIA!!”</p><p>His breathing turned rough as he yelled angrily. “Did you deliberately prank on me or what? What the hell is going on with your head? Is it really fun to dig a trap for me to jump into?”</p><p>Kang Xia intentionally put on a face that looked like she had just been wronged. “You can’t blame me on this one, Boss! Andy knows Avril, that world-class designer, and she’s her best friend. She promised that she would give me two of Avril’s latest designs, you know.”</p><p>“Holy shit…”</p><p>Tang Xiu was completely flabbergasted. Never even in his wildest dreams did he think that he would be sold out just for two pieces of clothing.</p><p>****</p><p>Imperial Dragon Villa was a newly developed villa complex in Star City’s New Metro. Among these villas was the most majestic King villa that was taken possession by Long Group for Long Hanwen, who had now moved there after the quick renovation project. The villa complex itself was now regarded to have taken the position of South Gate Town as the best and most upscale villa complex in Star City.</p><p>At #1 villa.</p><p>Long Hanwen’s sedan just stopped in front of the courtyard when he saw Li Yuetao, the Deputy Mayor, sitting under the gazebo. Accompanying him were the newly appointed chief of the Public Security Bureau, Jiang Fei, and the Head Representative William of the US Harbo Group for China. Around them were also four burly men in black suits, looking vigilant in their security duty.</p><p>“Deputy Mayor Li, Chief Jiang.”</p><p>Long Hanwen greeted them after coming over.</p><p>Li Yuetao and Jiang Fei got up, including William.</p><p>“I hope Chief Long can forgive and understand our visit so early in the morning. I know you’re a busy businessman, but the pressure is mounting on us from the top, so we’re also bound here,” said Li Yuetao with a smile.</p><p>“Deputy Mayor Li, I already know the purpose of your visit and what you want to say,” replied Long Hanwen with a cold face. “Let’s spare ourselves the talk about this issue anymore. Additionally, the three of you also know how busy I am. Please forgive me since I don’t have much time to entertain you.”</p><p>Afterward, he turned and headed inside the villa.</p><p>Li Yuetao forced a bitter smile and exchanged looks with Jiang Fei before he chased him. As he walked side-by-side with Long Hanwen, he spoke with a forced smile, “Chief Long, I’m going to be honest with you. Harbo Group is indeed at fault on this matter. I would have been as furious as you if I were in your shoes as well. But the milk is already spilled and you’ve locked Solund for a day; shouldn’t it be enough for your anger to dissipate already? Also, William is visiting in person in good faith to discuss the solution with you too.”</p><p>“Negotiating for the solution, huh?” Long Hanwen indignantly snorted. “What big joke are you playing? My son is still lying in the ICU of Star City Chinese Medical Hospital with his life and death still unknown so far! Do you think I can just easily let this matter go? My door is open for negotiation if my son can recover, but I’ll make that Cal Solund bastard pay with his life if anything bad happens to my son’s condition!”</p><p>“Chief Long, the Harbo Group is one of the world’s top 50 corporations that has invested tens of billions of yuan in the southern region of the country. Solund’s father is the major shareholder of this Harbo Group and the consequences will be quite serious for China as a country if this matter is left unsolved. It’s very likely that it will also greatly impact the next investment this company will do in the country. Please give me and our country some face and drop this matter. You can rest assured that the Harbo Group will definitely give big compensation.”</p><p>Long Hanwen was silent for a moment and then said, “Deputy Mayor Li, please go back! I’ll consider this matter first, but let me tell you something. It’s impossible if you want me to release that bastard now!”</p><p>“You…”</p><p>Li Yuetao was a remarkable figure from the government, so how could he not conclude that Long Hanwen didn’t want to give him face? Yet, he wasn’t angry since he understood Long Hanwen’s feelings and situation. Someone maimed the son he cherished and valued the most, and his son’s life and death were still in the balance. How could Long Hanwen be able to just drop this matter given his identity?</p><p>This will be quite the trouble!</p><p>LI Yuetao bitterly smiled inwardly and finally could only reply helplessly, “If so, I’ll be waiting for good news from Chief Long, then.”</p><p>When Li Yuetao returned to the gazebo, he looked at the two pairs of eyes focusing on him. Then, he reluctantly forced a smile and said, “William, it seems that the matter is not easy to resolve. After all, the son of President Long is still lying in the hospital and chance is he may die at any time. In other words, you may have a foreign investor status here, but it was your side who did the deed. Even if President Long didn’t act to detain Cal Solund, I’m afraid that it would be the City Public Security Bureau’s people who would arrest him. Let’s take a step back and take it slow. President Long is rather furious at this time, but I’m sure when his son’s injury eases, maybe his anger will disappear. We may be able to resolve this matter smoothly when we come to negotiate again then.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
