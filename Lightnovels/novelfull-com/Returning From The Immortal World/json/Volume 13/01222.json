When he returned to his house in the Bluestar Villa Complex, Kang Xia, Mu Wanying, and Ouyang Lulu were already in the living room, looking worried and restless. They immediately ran over after seeing him return.</p><p>“Are you alright?”</p><p>“Why did you disappear for 2 days? We went to the Blue Starfish Mansion to find you, but you were nowhere to be found. Where did you go these two days?”</p><p>“We were really worried about you.”</p><p>Looking at these three women express their true feelings and concern towards him, Tang Xiu felt warm and good inside. He consoled them and then slowly said, “I was actually staying in the Blue Starfish Mansion all the time. Only, I had to treat the patient and I couldn’t be disturbed by anything from the outside, so I told Ji Chimei to stand guard. Well, I’m back already, so let’s not talk about this anymore. Let’s talk about the current situation in Shanghai. I’m sure a lot of super-rich people have come here since the auction is getting near, right?”</p><p>“That’s for sure, even the number makes me scared.” Ouyang Lulu was the first to speak. “The entire Shanghai is now in high alert and the security level has been raised to the highest level. Honey, I don’t think you know about this yet. All 4-stars and 5-stars hotels in the whole of Shanghai have been fully reserved by various super-rich people from various countries all over the world, as well as those billionaires from the country. Our Paradise Manor is also fully occupied now.”</p><p>“I’ve been staying at the Genesis Auction House for the last 2 days.” Kang Xia said, “There are already more than 1,600 rich people who have contacted Hao Lei to confirm their attendance in the auction. There’s only a day left from the deadline, so I believe the number of attendances will still explode before tomorrow evening. Hao Lei herself predicted that the number of rich people participating in the auction will be at least 2,000.”</p><p>“Have you investigated them? Especially their identities and their wealth?” asked Tang Xiu.</p><p>“It’s been investigated thoroughly.” Kang Xia nodded. “Further, we have also checked the liquid cash of each participant. All of them meet our requirements. Also, each of them has paid 1 million in admission fee and we have collected more than 160 million yuan as of now.”</p><p>“Well, it’s a bit unexpected to me, but the more these rich people attend our auction, the more we prove the auction can make a sensation all over the world.” Tang Xiu chuckled. “By then, not only can we profit a lot, but this event can also serve to propel up the reputation of Genesis Auction House and we can expect to see it become another money-making machine in the future.”</p><p>The next day.</p><p>Tang Xiu went to the Genesis Auction House with Ji Chimei. Just as he arrived at the entrance, he was squeezed aside by a group of four men and women. One man among them even glared at him and then spoke to the registration staffer, “We must attend this auction. This is 4 million for the admission fee. These four cards are the standard international black cards with 200 million USD on each card. Hurry up and register our names!”</p><p>“Alright! Please wait for a bit.” The registrar politely replied.</p><p>Tang Xiu stood behind the four people and just swept over at their backs. Then, he transmitted his voice to Ji Chimei. “This auction has even attracted various freaks and monsters like these ones. This is interesting. They seem to be really loaded as well.”</p><p>“Indeed. They should be some divergent races since I can sense a beastly smell from them,” replied Ji Chimei.</p><p>“Well, whoever comes here is a guest.” Tang Xiu faintly smiled. “Whether they are divergent races or not, we’ll receive their money according to their bills. But I need you to hold the fort here in the following events. Do not show mercy to those who dare to snatch the items of our auction house. Capture them first and squeeze them to find out their background. But directly kill those who act unbridled.”</p><p>“Understood.” Ji Chimei nodded.</p><p>Tang Xiu waved and casually motioned her to move, then he went straight into the auction house. He took the elevator to the third floor and saw Hao Lei waiting outside after the elevator’s doors opened.</p><p>“Sect Master.” Hao Lei respectfully greeted.</p><p>“Anything happened in the last two days?” asked Tang Xiu.</p><p>“No.” Hao Lei shook her heard. “Everything is going well.”</p><p>Tang Xiu nodded in response and said, “I’ve brought Ji Chimei here, so we don’t need to worry about disturbances. Also, you need to prep everything needed for the auction in advance. Invite some members of the world’s most famous auction house if you don’t know what to prepare and be sure to find an outstanding host even if you must spend some funds.”</p><p>“Well, Ouyang Lulu has invited the most famous host of the Red Spider Auction House in Las Vegas yesterday. This host is very excellent and I’ve watched the auctions he has hosted. Every auction he hosts always reaps massive profits.”</p><p>“Ouyang Lulu?” Tang Xiu was surprised and asked, “How did she get acquainted with this outstanding host?”</p><p>A strange expression appeared on Hao Lei’s beautiful face before she covered her mouth and giggled. “Uh, well. I asked her about this too. She told me that she had a fight with this golden host and none of them ended up the winner. Just like a story when you win a friend after exchanging blows, they then gradually became friends. It’s said that this golden host once visited Jingmen Island on a trip and encountered some troubles there, then Ouyang Lulu stood up for him and dealt with his problems and accompanied him to tour around for a few days.”</p><p>Tang Xiu quickly understood and smilingly said, “That was her indeed. Only she can pull out such a stunt. Anyways, let’s head to your office. I need to talk to you.”</p><p>Hao Lei nodded and was about to lead the way for Tang Xiu to her office when her cell phone suddenly rang. After she exchanged words for a few seconds, her face slightly changed. She quickly glanced at Tang Xiu and said, “Some people are causing a scene downstairs, Sect Master. I heard they’re about to fight.”</p><p>“Who are they?” Tang Xiu furrowed his brows and asked.</p><p>“Our men downstairs have no idea about their identity yet,” replied Hao Lei.</p><p>“Let’s head downstairs and have a look together since we’re here.” Tang Xiu said, “I don’t care whoever it is, but even the Heavenly Emperor must abide by the rules of our auction house for the following days.”</p><p>On the first floor.</p><p>Four men and women stood in front of the registration desk and exchanged glares with a man and a woman. A contemptuous look flashed in one of the burly man’s eyes as he spoke to the man in front. “Heh, you’re really a coward hiding behind a woman, Ankeanu! If it wasn’t for her protection, I would have packed you up, twisted your neck, and used your skull as a wine cup!”</p><p>Ankeanu’s face looked a bit pale and turned to the gorgeous belle beside him before lowering his head without retorting back.</p><p>Beside him, however, the belle looked angry and glared at the seemingly cowardly Ankeanu. Then she shifted to the four people in front and coldly snorted. “Hmph. Shut your stinking holes if you four don’t wanna lie on the bed for a few months again. I’m in a good mood today and I don’t want to bicker over shits with you, else you can try to piss me off and I’ll make you look great!”</p><p>The big Caucasian man obviously dreaded the belle a bit. He hummed twice and said, “Angelo, this chick is the one who made you severely injured before, isn’t she? Stop zipping your mouth and looking so sullen, will you? Let’s just join hands and finish her directly. We four will bear it together if the Grand Elders blame us. I’m sure we won’t be severely punished by the Grand Elder given our status.”</p><p>The man called Angelo shook his head and said, “I came for the elixirs and weapons this time, not to cause a scene. You can have a go and kill them yourself. But I’m warning you in advance. The Magnificent Tang Corporation is the shareholder of this Genesis Auction and they hate troublemaking foreigners. I’m sure you’ve heard about what happened in Star City over a month ago. Do it yourself if you really don’t wanna attend the auction!”</p><p>After hearing this, the big white man immediately spat at the belle and sneered. “I’m not gonna pack you up today. Just wait for the auction to end. The four of us will teach you a lesson later. We’ll make you know that any man in the world is much better than your spineless companion.”</p><p>“You court death!”</p><p>The belle instantly dashed forward and a sharp dagger swept across the white man’s neck, causing a stream of blood to slowly leak out from the wound.</p><p>The white man didn’t expect that she would directly attack to kill him. His head would have rolled down if he hadn’t avoided the strike fast enough.</p><p>“B*TCH!!!”</p><p>The white man himself had a short fuse with his powder-keg-like temper. A huge aura burst out from him as he dashed at the belle in that instant. His golden-gloved right fist flashed as he delivered tens of golden punches instantly while hurling out a stream of loud curses.</p><p>BAM, BAM…</p><p>A blurry figure suddenly appeared and nearly in the blink of an eye, the big man and the belle were sent flying after the clash. Tang Xiu then clapped and overbearingly spoke, “I don’t give a damn if you fight someplace else. But if you all wanna play gangsters in my Genesis Auction House, don’t blame the staff here acting ruthless towards you. Register now or get the hell out!”</p><p>The fearsome strength displayed by Tang Xiu deterred the Caucasian man and his companions. After hesitating for a while, they finally gave up retaliating and left with sullen and awkward expressions. But the belle, whose face now looked a bit pale, kept staring at Tang Xiu. This man was definitely very young, yet he was able to beat her and the big white man, which showed that he had a fearsome strength.</p><p>Tang Xiu stared back at the belle and said in a deep voice, “What are you staring for? Hurry up and register and move your feet out of this place! And only come again when the auction starts.”</p><p>“What’s your name, handsome?” asked the belle.</p><p>“I’m the owner of this Genesis Auction House.” Tang Xiu lightly replied, “You can call me Tang.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
