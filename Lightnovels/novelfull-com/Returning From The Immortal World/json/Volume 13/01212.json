I need to know from which forces they are from.”</p><p>The young man handed the documents in his hand to him and said, “They are from the American major companies, all of which are in the world’s top 50 companies. You also know that the Magnificent Tang Corp. has issued an announcement that they are opening a cooperation deal for the position of their products’ distributors in various countries around the world, so the representatives of companies from various countries came to Star City. The four forces involved in the battle on the footage are all from four American companies. Additionally, we’ve also investigated them and the force behind Dandelion and Harbo should be the Stygian Club.”</p><p>Duanmu Lin read the document and his expression looked grim. He had no idea what Tang Xiu was selling, nor did he know from which source this footage came from.</p><p>“We’re going to Star City.”</p><p>****</p><p>It was dusk when Tang Xiu, along with Kang Xia, came to the Magnificent Tang Corp.’s HQ and were greeted by tens of media who had been waiting in the company’s conference hall before they arrived.</p><p>“Welcome to all friends from the media.”</p><p>It was his first time appearing before the mass media and he straightly looked at the cameras aimed at him by these excited-looking reporters. Then, he began speaking in a deep voice, “I’m Tang Xiu, the owner of the Magnificent Tang Corporation. I’m holding this press conference to announce an issue. The three companies, Cupid, Dandelion and Sava Groups, have openly clashed in Star City and violated the previous announcement my company has issued, so the Magnificent Tang Corporation has decided not to work with these 3 companies.”</p><p>“Mr. Tang, can you tell us how these three companies fought? Why didn’t we get any news about it from any media?” asked a reporter hurriedly.</p><p>“I myself am not in a position to elaborate about the details,” said Tang Xiu. “But what I can tell you is that these three companies have clashed with the Harbo Group and committed murders. I think a public security department will be involved later. But in any case, my Magnificent Tang Corporation has always been a law-abiding company and thus, we decided that we’ll never cooperate with these companies since they have disrupted orders in Star City.”</p><p>Shortly afterward, he directly announced the termination of the press conference and directly left to the GM’s office upstairs, leaving the rest of the issues to Kang Xia.</p><p><em>Ring, ring, ring…</em></p><p>His cell phone rang just as he lit a cigarette and took a few puffs.</p><p>“What’s the situation?”</p><p>“The battle between the four forces has been concluded, Sect Master. All from Harbo Group but the seriously injured William died, whereas Dandelion suffered heavy losses. But they successfully annihilated the Cupid and Sava Groups. Our intel operatives are closely monitoring Jezek and William and they seem to be heading for Magnificent Tang Corporation site.” Jin Shi reported.</p><p>“They must be coming here to claim the credits, but they won’t expect a virulent and punitive force waiting for them shortly after.” Tang Xiu sneered. “Anyways, Jin Shi, pick some competent men and send them to the U.S. Their mission is to lay dormant there and to figure out the next movements of these four companies even if they must buy intel from the Darkwind. Additionally, I’ve informed Mo Awu’s team to head to the U.S. to start working on the intel network there right after they’ve settled the issues in Japan. Lastly, I give you 2 months to complete the intel network all over China and make it operate normally before you set off for the U.S.”</p><p>“Understood,” replied Jin Shi respectfully.</p><p>At the junction of Star City and Old City district, two cars sped toward the Magnificent Tang Corporation site. Jezek, who had reverted back to his human form, glanced at the seriously injured William who had fainted at the side with annoyance in his eyes.</p><p>He just called the HQ and reported what had happened here, only to receive a stream of curses. The reason was simple: fighting with each other.</p><p>It made him feel wronged since he never knew that Harbo Group was on their side. Not to mention that the friction between the two companies did exist, to begin with. However, his immediate superior simply ignored everything he said and gave him a death order after hurling those toxic curses. He was commanded to hold onto the Magnificent Tang Corporation tightly and struggle to secure the distribution rights in the U.S for that company’s products regardless of the losses.</p><p><em>It ought to be doable… it won’t be a problem, right?</em></p><p>Jezek recalled his secret talk with Tang Xiu earlier and felt quite relieved. As long as this cooperation talk was successful, he would become a hero after returning. At that time, he would definitely get a reward and maybe could go further and become a leading figure in the company’s HQ.</p><p><em>Ring, ring…</em></p><p>The notification ringtone was heard from the cell phone in his pocket. It was a friend of his who sent a video and added some texts below it, causing his expression to enormously change.</p><p>“I really didn’t expect you to be a legendary werewolf, Jezek. It seems that your Dandelion Company belongs to someone from the Stygian Club, huh! My daughter died in the hands of those Stygian Club bastards. I’ll see you crawl and kneel and knock your head before me when you return to the U.S. later!”</p><p>Jezek quickly opened the video attachment which made his expression change to extreme shock and disbelief.</p><p><em>This… What’s going on? How could someone hiddenly record the fight? That place was so desolate that not even any worker was seen there. Who was the bravado that took this video secretly?</em></p><p><em>Ring, ring…</em></p><p>Another incoming text.</p><p>Jezek’s expression instantly turned pale after watching the new video as strength and reason left his whole being. These two texts and videos shocked him to the core, especially the last one which was the footage of the Magnificent Tang Corporation where Tang Xiu’s somber and grim speech was like stabbing his heart.</p><p><em>How did this happen?</em></p><p>Jezek took a deep breath and immediately dialed Tang Xiu’s number.</p><p>“Mr. Tang.”</p><p>“Jezek?” Tang Xiu replied in a heavy voice, “You made me very disappointed and furious. I already warned you before that you must be careful and cautious in your actions, yet your fight was spotted and captured by someone? But the most important thing is, what exactly are you? How did you turn to something like a werewolf in the Western world, huh? You and William are like the werewolves in the movies.”</p><p>“I…” Jezek’s reply was stuck in his throat after getting bombarded with the inquisitive questioning.</p><p>“Hmph, forget it.” Tang Xiu sneered again. “I don’t give a fuck what you are. But what you did was against my wish. You already know that I don’t want anyone to propagate any evil deeds in Star City, yet you’ve exposed yourself and was caught red-handed. You can say that everyone from various countries in the world has received that video now, which makes any chance of cooperation between us impossible. Further, you must explain why you crossed the rest and joined William? He’s the mastermind who has injured my friend!”</p><p>“This…”</p><p>Jezek was speechless and at a loss.</p><p>“Don’t ever think you can fool me on this issue by pretending to be mute and dumb, Jezek.” Tang Xiu went on in a heavy voice, “Congratulations for ruining my expectation for you after that secret talk. But I want to ask you something. Did you want to play me on purpose?”</p><p>“You misunderstood, Mr. Tang. How could I be playing you,” replied Jezek hurriedly. “I only realized that the Harbo turned out to have a deep relation with my Dandelion Group when fighting. Let’s just say that the Big Bosses of the two companies are members of the same group.”</p><p><em>Toot, toot, toot…</em></p><p>Tang Xiu directly hung up.</p><p>The feeling of wanting to cry but being unable to shed any tears inundated Jezek’s heart the moment he heard the disconnect tone. He knew that it was no longer possible to secure any cooperation between his Dandelion Group and Magnificent Tang Corporation no matter how hard he tried. Further, he could expect to be punished severely after returning since he failed the mission.</p><p><em>NO!</em></p><p><em>I must see Tang Xiu and explain it to him in person! I must strike the deal regardless of the methods and whatever the cost!</em></p><p>Quickly after, he arrived at the Magnificent Tang Corp’s site. After obtaining Tang Xiu’s consent to meet, he then quickly headed upstairs.</p><p>The moment he saw Tang Xiu, Jezek hurriedly spoke, “Please listen to my explanation, Mr. Tang.”</p><p>Tang Xiu sat on the sofa with a cold face. He puffed out a cloud of smoke and said in a very dissatisfied tone, “What else can you explain? It was you who proactively came to me and secretly negotiated to teach those Harbo people. I didn’t give you my consent firstly, but you looked so eager. I reluctantly agreed to your suggestion since I did have the intention to cooperate with your Dandelion company. Then what did I get in return, huh? It turns out that you and Harbo are on the same side. So tell me, how should I face you now? You keep moving forward and desperately pushing me to your opposite, are you trying to deal with me or what?”</p><p>Jezek almost cried and desperately shook his head. “It’s all my fault, Mr. Tang. It’s just that I didn’t expect William to be one of ours. I never knew that the Harbo and Dandelion turn out to be on the same side, either. Else, I’d never have come to you to gain your approval and tried my best just for naught and paid a huge price like this.”</p><p>“Alright, I won’t argue over your claim that you know nothing about it,” said Tang Xiu. “But what about that video? Who in the world is behind the scenes and what could be their agenda? Why must they expose it after I and my company have declared that any trouble isn’t allowed? Don’t you see this farce is aimed to smear my company’s reputation?”</p><p><em>How come this can be that serious?</em></p><p>Jezek groaned inwardly and stammered. “I have no idea who could be hiding there and secretly took the video, Mr. Tang. But as long as you don’t refuse the cooperation offer from my company, I can assure you that I’ll find those who shot the video and teach them a hard lesson.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
