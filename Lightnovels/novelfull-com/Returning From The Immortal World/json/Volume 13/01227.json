His figure flickered and fiercely slapped that young man’s face and sent him flying back to heavily fall on the floor. Tang Xiu quickly pursued and stamped his foot on his face and coldly said, “Tell me, which family are you from in Beijing?!”</p><p>The young man lost several teeth from the slap and half of his face was red and swollen. Although he struggled desperately to free himself the moment Tang Xiu stepped on his cheek, he still couldn’t get up. His overwhelming anger nearly made him lose his mind as he growled. “I’m from the Su Family, you bastard! Get. Your. F*cking. Foot. Off. Me. Tang Xiu, bastard! Your family is no longer the Tang Family it once was. I’m sure they have all f*cking died! Let go of me, else I’ll kill you!”</p><p>Tang Xiu kicked the youth’s belly fiercely and sent him sweeping the floor until he hit Chen Haoran’s feet. Then, he coldly said, “That line alone is enough to make you a dead man. But I don’t want to kill him just like that. Now I’m giving him to you all. Take him with you everywhere for the next two days, else you can expect your families to end up just like his!”</p><p>Having said that, he turned to Bai Tao and Qin Shaoyang and lightly spoke, “Prepare some meal and wine. I’m going to make you both see a play tonight. Hmph… the members of House Tang are occupied by important things, so they left China temporarily. But these people made a big mistake if they think there’s no one left in the family. I can easily destroy any family by myself.”</p><p>Seeing Tang Xiu’s actions made Qin Shaoyang secretly feel at ease like having vented his own anger. He replied in a deep voice, “I’ll tell some people to prepare the best dishes and best wine. Let’s eat to our hearts’ content. I already have enough of holding back today.”</p><p>Chen Haoran glanced at Tang Xiu and recalled the many legends about him. Although he couldn’t confirm 100% about his conjecture, he was well aware that Tang Xiu was already a powerful person by himself even without the shelter of his family. Just his company alone was not what it used to be, to say the least.</p><p>However, if House Tang really collapsed, only then would it be very difficult for Tang Xiu to preserve Magnificent Tang Corporation no matter how huge and well-funded it had become now. No matter how successful and filthy rich any business person was, they would never be able to fight against those top dogs in power, for they would have no choice but to yield.</p><p><em>If there’s a chance…</em></p><p>A hint of greed birthed inside Chen Haoran’s heart. He shot a cold look at Tang Xiu before he immediately propped up his beaten-up companion with the others and quickly left the Monarch Club.</p><p>Tang Xiu took out his cell phone and dialed a number. Then, he spoke, “Senior Duanmu, as per our previous agreement, I have picked up some families to serve as a warning for the rest. The first one is the Su Family of Beijing, and the second one will be the one appearing later to strike the Magnificent Tang Corporation.”</p><p>“Alright!” Duanmu Lin’s reply came from the phone.</p><p>****</p><p>Night came.</p><p>The Su Family’s residence was now very lively since one of their core members had just been promoted recently. Many people in the family celebrated the happy occasion for him and wished him well for further promotion in the future.</p><p>The Head of the Su Family of Beijing was Su Xiangdong and he was already 80-years-old this year. After spending most of his life struggling and working, he was finally able to make his family thrive with many offspring and grandchildren. The family now even had a fourth generation. He had 3 sons and 2 daughters, and the one who was recently promoted was his youngest son, Su Dingguo, now a deputy mayor of a certain city at a young age—one term which people used to call as an “executive”.</p><p>“Dingguo! Only a few of our family members hold government posts. Although your first brother also holds a considerable position, he’s just a department level leader, while your second brother doesn’t want to be an official and runs a business. He may be able to mix in some fields, but I don’t favor him at all. So, as long as I still live and your first brother still holds his post, you still have a huge backer behind your back, so keep working hard. Our family has always been a second-class family in Beijing, but I hope I can see our family squeeze into the ranks of first-class families in the capital in my lifetime.”</p><p>“I’ll definitely try my best, Father.” Su Dingguo nodded and said, “Also, several friends are preparing to invest in the area under my jurisdiction because of me recently. I’m the one in charge of investment promotion, so it won’t be difficult to be promoted further as long as I can make some political achievements.”</p><p>“You can expect our family resources to be focused on you as much as possible later,” said Su Xiangdong happily. “I expect you to do your best in your work and empower yourself step by step. You must go farther than your big brother in the future.”</p><p>“I’ll definitely try my best, Father,” Su Dingguo replied with a smile.</p><p>Suddenly, a middle-aged man rushed into the room. When he stopped in front of Su Xiangdong and Su Dingguo, he reported with a low voice, “There’s something unusual, Patriarch.”</p><p>“What’s wrong?” Su Xiangdong furrowed his brows.</p><p>“We have been seeing many strangers appear near our residence since about an hour ago.” The middle-aged man said, “They seem to walk around casually or are engaged in some activities. But they keep watching our site, be it intentional or not. I’ve sent Xiao Long’s team outside to figure out the exact situation, but they haven’t returned after some people led them away.”</p><p>Su Xiangdong’s expression slightly changed and he asked in a deep voice, “Go check it yourself and ask who they are. Apprehend them directly if you find them suspicious.”</p><p>“Understood!” the middle-aged man replied and strode out of the room.</p><p>A few minutes later.</p><p>The middle-aged man went towards the two young men with four tough men who had remarkable skills. He shot a look at the two men and asked in in a deep voice, “Who are you guys? Why are you spying on my Su Family?”</p><p>The two youths exchanged glances and one of them lightly replied, “I have no idea what you’re talking about! We just had dinner, so we are strolling around to digest the food.”</p><p>“Lying, huh!” The middle-aged man snorted coldly and said, “Capture them! Give them a hard lesson if they refuse to spit out their true purpose!”</p><p>“Roger!”</p><p>The four big men answered and moved to catch the two young men.</p><p>“The Su Family is rebelling!”</p><p>“The Sus have committed treason! They’re damned bastards!”</p><p>The two young men quickly retreated and shouted aloud.</p><p>In but a moment, many figures appeared in the vicinity and moved several times faster than average people’s speed. They directly attacked the middle-aged man and those four big men the moment they appeared, severely injuring them and knocking them out in just a few breaths.</p><p><em>Creak…</em></p><p>Four black cars quickly stopped at the gate of the Su Family’s residence. As a big man came out and opened the car’s door, Duanmu Lin and Tang Xiu got off the car. Wearing an indifferent face, Duanmu Lin glanced at the six tough men in front of the gate of the Su Family’s residence, whose expressions greatly changed, and shouted in a deep voice, “The Su Family has committed treason and must be punished for attacking the people from the Special Abilities Bureau! Storm their house and detain all of them! You’re allowed to kill anyone on the spot if they fight back!”</p><p>“Understood!”</p><p>Tens of experts from the Special Abilities Bureau dashed to the gate in front. The six experts of Su Family standing at the gate quickly exchanged glances and tried to stop them but were easily knocked out by the former.</p><p>The moment after, the whole residence of the Su Family was turned upside down into a complete mess.</p><p>In the deepest area of the residence, Su Xiangdong and Su Dingguo had already come out and their expression enormously changed after seeing tens of experts from the Special Abilities Bureau storm inside. As Su Dingguo roared, all the guards of the Su Family appeared and quickly lunged towards these experts.</p><p>The fight commenced and the killings began, causing the situation in the Su Family’s residence to turn more chaotic and the smell of blood to become stronger. However, it only took a few minutes for the Special Abilities Bureau’s experts to kill over than 10 guards of the Su Family.</p><p>“STOP IT! ALL OF YOU, STOP!”</p><p>Su Xiangdong’s expression looked miserable and desperate. He could see that the enemies who attacked his family were very strong. They were so powerful that he shuddered with fright. To make him feel worse was the sight of several special abilities unleashed by some of these enemies.</p><p>That’s right, these people were using special abilities! He knew that nearly all ability users in China were under the Special Abilities Bureau. He had a faint hunch that these people attacking his family were people from this agency.</p><p>Duanmu Lin and Tang Xiu slowly walked into the backyard. Tang Xiu sneered upon seeing that the fight on both sides had stopped.</p><p>“Are you Patriarch Su?” asked Tang Xiu lightly.</p><p>Su Xiangdong’s expression slightly changed after seeing Tang Xiu, but his aged body secretly trembled and he looked horrified when he saw Duanmu Lin. He knew who Duanmu Lin was and realized that his guess was on the mark—the people attacking his family were from the Special Abilities Bureau.</p><p>“Director Duanmu.”</p><p>Su Xiangdong cupped his fists and quickly loosened his stance. With a bitter smile on his face, he said, “Director Duanmu, I’m honored by your visit, but there’s no need to display such a battle formation like this, is there? If someone in my family has offended you, you can come here alone and no one in my family will dare to oppose you, Director Duanmu.”</p><p>“Su Xiangdong, your family is colluding with some foreign forces with which you’ve become a huge threat to the security of the state.” Duanmu Lin indifferently said, “We have received a confidential report that you, Su Xiangdong, has committed treason. I didn’t believe it at first, but your men just attacked the Special Abilities Bureau’s people. It seems that the information is correct, so everyone in your family must die!”</p><p><em>Treason?</em></p><p>Disbelief was all over Su Xiangdong’s face as he loudly exclaimed, “Director Duanmu, you can put whatever into your mouth, but you should be more mindful of what comes out it. My family has always known our place, so how can we become traitors and sell our own country? There must be a misunderstanding here!”</p><p>Duanmu Lin looked at Tang Xiu with an expression that said: “you handle it”.</p><p>Tang Xiu nodded to him without a word. Then, his lips shifted with a sneer. “Heh, Patriarch Su, you may say that your family didn’t betray the country. But your claim doesn’t count against mine.”</p><p>Su Xiangdong’s expression changed yet again. He stared fixedly at Tang Xiu and carefully observed his expression. Then, he slowly said, “Aren’t you Tang Xiu from House Tang?”</p><p>“Ah, it seems you haven’t lost your sight from old age and can still recognize such a nobody like me.” Tang Xiu chuckled. “You’re correct. I’m Tang Xiu from the Tang Family.”</p><p>“Is there any feud between my family and yours?” asked Su Xiangdong.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
