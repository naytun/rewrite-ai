Feeling helpless and desperate, there was nothing Chang Wei could do but brace himself forward. “General Manager Wang, Big sis-in-law, please come inside.”</p><p>General Manager Wang, however, looked a bit cold and indifferently said, “She’s my daughter!”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>Chang Wei stared blankly and looked embarrassed afterward. He hurriedly said, “I’m sorry for being unable to figure out who you’re, thus speaking mistakenly. General Manager Wang, Ms. Wang, please come inside.”</p><p>“You really have no eyes, don’t you?” The girl chuckled and said, “I really don’t get why my Dad knows someone like you. Let’s go inside, then! I wanna see what kind of girlfriend you found with such eyes. She should be a blind person like you, yes?”</p><p><em>Blind? F*ck you!</em></p><p>Chang Wei angrily swore inside. He couldn’t help but feel a bad premonition inwardly. Although he was young, he had experienced many things. How could he not see that this daughter of General Manager Wang had the intention to make a mess? Suddenly, he secretly regretted licking this man’s ass and greeting him. He was simply courting misfortune for himself.</p><p>Quickly after, Chang Wei took General Manager Wang and his daughter and came back to Tang Xiu and Su Yaning. There was a helpless look on his face as he introduced them. “Yaning, Tang Xiu, this is my superior, General Manager Wang and his daughter. General Manager Wang, this is my girlfriend, Su Yaning and this her cousin.”</p><p>After glancing at Su Yaning’s face, General Manager Wang’s gaze finally fell on Tang Xiu’s face and knitted his brows. He felt that Tang Xiu looked familiar, but he forgot where he had seen his face before.</p><p>“Hello, President Wang.”</p><p>Tang Xiu got up and stretched out his hand after restraining his smile.</p><p>General Manager Wang shook hands with Tang Xiu and nodded. “My little girl is intentionally making some trouble, so I have to come over to dine with you and I hope I didn’t disturb you. However, we still have something to do and can’t have lunch with you. Enjoy your meal.”</p><p>“Dad…”</p><p>The young woman’s eyes never left Tang Xiu the moment she saw him. When she heard her father say they were taking their leave, she hurriedly grabbed his hand.</p><p>On the other hand, Tang Xiu felt disgusted by the way this young woman looked at him. He felt like he was being stared at by a hungry female pervert. He could even sense from her aura that she just had sex with a man at least 2 hours ago.</p><p>“I see. Then we won’t insist to have you accompany us since President Wang still has things to tend to.”</p><p>General Manager Wang glanced at his daughter, then looked at Tang Xiu and felt a bit helpless inside. After faintly giving an “Umm” in reply, he ignored his daughter’s pleading look and pulled her away.</p><p>As he walked away for several meters, General Manager Wang’s eyes suddenly lit up when he saw the Everlasting Feast Hall’s manager coming inside. He paced forward to greet him immediately and smilingly said, “Mr. Hu, my daughter has been missing the dishes of the Everlasting Feast Hall. She just pulled me over right after I finished my lunch. You…”</p><p>The refined middle-aged manager, who wore golden-rimmed glasses, just nodded to General Manager Wang in response and directly brushed past him, causing the General Manager Wang’s smile to freeze. The manager then strode towards Tang Xiu and respectfully bowed and said, “Boss, I didn’t know you were dining here. I hope you don’t blame me. My name is Hu Haoming, and I am now acting as the General Manager of our Shanghai’s Everlasting Feast Hall.”</p><p>A wry smile appeared on Tang Xiu’s face as he nodded and said, “I know. Go tend to your business first! I just returned to the mainland. Wait for me to finish my meal, I’ll go to the second floor to find you afterward.”</p><p>Hu Haoming hesitated for a while before he nodded and prudently said, “Then I’ll be waiting for you. But please notify me right away if you need anything else. I’ll be immediately at your service.”</p><p>Having said that, he nodded to Chang Wei and Su Yaning before prudently turning around and leaving.</p><p>“Boss?!”</p><p>Chang Wei was flabbergasted. He knew the General Manager of this restaurant and was well aware that the man was well-known in the restaurant industry in the capital. However, he never dreamed that the upscale restaurant he chose randomly turned out to be Tang Xiu’s business.</p><p>It must be noted that the Everlasting Feast Hall was now owned by the Magnificent Tang Corporation. How big was this company… no… this company was simply a colossus! Yet, Tang Xiu was actually the Everlasting Feast Hall’s owner. That was really difficult to believe…</p><p>Suddenly, Chang Wei’s pupils abruptly shrank and he couldn’t help but shudder. He finally realized one thing. <em>The Everlasting Feast Hall belongs to the Magnificent Tang Corporation and its Manager just addressed Tang Xiu as Boss. Then… Tang Xiu… is he the Magnificent Tang Corporation’s owner?</em></p><p><em>Tang Xiu… Tang Xiu?… Tang Xiu?!</em></p><p>Chang Wei recalled the name in his mind three times and his legs went soft immediately. If he didn’t put his hands on the table to support himself, he would have slumped to the floor immediately.</p><p><em>Isn’t the name of the Magnificent Tang Corporation’s Big Boss Tang Xiu?</em></p><p>“You’re…”</p><p>Chang Wei’s lips squirmed, but he couldn’t utter anything else at the moment.</p><p>Tang Xiu lightly smiled and waved his hand. “Cousin-in-law, you’re my cousin’s boyfriend, so we’re relatives. There’s no need to be bothered by my background or identity when we dine together, no? But if there’s one thing I need to say, we don’t need to pay for our meal since this restaurant is mine.”</p><p>Several meters away, General Manager Wang was dumbstruck and his heart pounded hard. From Hu Haoming’s address just now, he suddenly realized why he felt that the young man looked familiar. It was because he was the owner of this Everlasting Feast Hall and the Big Boss of the Magnificent Tang Corporation!</p><p>I’m so stupid and dumb.</p><p>With deep regret inside his heart, General Manager Wang would have really wanted to slap his own face and his big mouth if there weren’t so many people present.</p><p>Who was Tang Xiu? He was the Magnificent Tang Corporation’s Big Boss and the famous Divine Doctor in China!</p><p>How many people wanted to have a meal with him in this world? Yet they had no qualifications. What about himself then? It was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to fawn upon him, yet he was the one who turned it down himself.</p><p><em>If this matter is known to anyone, they will definitely point to my nose and call me dumb, right?</em> General Manager Wang squeezed out a smile that was uglier than crying.</p><p>“What’s wrong with you, Dad?”</p><p>Although the young woman felt some regret for being unable to dine with that super handsome guy, she noticed the bizarre expression on her father’s face and hurriedly asked.</p><p>“Dear daughter, Dad didn’t listen to you and just missed a chance to hug a big tree,” General Manager Wang bitterly said.</p><p>“What do you mean?” The young woman was confused.</p><p>“Do you know about the Magnificent Tang Corporation?” asked General Manager Wang in a whisper.</p><p>“Why? Is there anyone in China who doesn’t know this company?” The young woman nodded and said, “Those who don’t know this company must be aliens who have just returned from outer space.”</p><p>“You know, that young man just now was Tang Xiu, the owner of the Magnificent Tang Corporation,” General Manager Wang bitterly said.</p><p>“What?!” the young woman exclaimed aloud.</p><p>General Manager Wang hurriedly grabbed the girl’s hand and headed outside half-running. Although he was full of regrets, he was secretly thankful that Chang Wei was Tang Xiu’s cousin-in-law. He made up his mind not to pull an attitude in front of Chang Wei anymore in the future and would even treat him as his living ancestor.</p><p>In the hall.</p><p>Su Yaning pulled Chang Wei to take a seat, but the guy himself felt like he was sitting on a cushion full of needles. To sit and have a meal with Tang Xiu, the Big Boss of the Magnificent Tang Corporation, was something he never dared imagine before. He recalled how he showed off in front of Tang Xiu before and even deliberately introduced himself and emphasized his workplace and identity. But now, he only felt ashamed and wished there was a hole he could dig and burrow himself into.</p><p>Looking at Chang We’s expression, Su Yaning suddenly felt a headache and said, “I knew it. Had I known it would turn like this, I’d have suggested picking another restaurant to lunch previously. I can tell we won’t have a good meal looking at him turn like this, you know.”</p><p>Tang Xiu also sighed inwardly, but he could understand Chang Wei’s feelings and smilingly said, “Cousin-in-law, there’s no need to feel and act so restrained in front of me, you see. Although I’m the owner of the Magnificent Tang Corporation, I’m just an ordinary person like everyone else. Besides, Su Yaning is also my cousin and you’re her companion. Just your relationship with her alone is already enough since you both love each other, so that makes us relatives. I hope you can treat my cousin well in the future.”</p><p>“I will do that!”</p><p>Chang Wei finally calmed down and firmly nodded after he turned to Su Yaning and shot her a deep look.</p><p>“You don’t blame me for not telling you earlier?” Su Yaning asked.</p><p>“I feel fortunate you didn’t tell me about it earlier. Otherwise, my intention to be together with you would not be as pure.” Chang Wei shook his head and smiled wryly. “Senior Tang… umm. Tang Xiu, you’re the owner of this restaurant, so I don’t need to smack my own face to treat you anymore, right? Let me offer you a toast with this cup of wine and use this chance to show my respect to you. After all, you’re someone I admire.”</p><p>“That’s great!”</p><p>Tang Xiu also raised his glass, had a toast with Chang Wei, and downed the white wine.</p><p>The lunch ended up with Tang Xiu and Su Yaning enjoying it to the full, while Chang Wei was still a bit restrained. It was likely that he couldn’t fully enjoy the dishes.</p><p>After lunch, Su Yaning and Chang Wei left, but Su Yaning told Tang Xiu before leaving that her entire family was now living in Shanghai, and she hoped that he would visit and have a meal at their home if he had spare time in the next few days.</p><p>Subsequently, Tang Xiu met the Everlasting Feast Hall’s General Manager, Hu Haoming, and chatted for a while. He then left, caught a taxi, and rushed to the Magnificent Tang Corporation’s HQ.</p><p>At the Magnificent Tang Industrial Park.</p><p>The company’s office itself was located at the outermost edge of the industrial park. When Tang Xiu got off the taxi, he looked up at the dozens of high-rise buildings and secretly felt happy. He was the designer of the company HQ himself, and after looking up from the ground, he could tell that the construction of the building accentuated the effect much better than he had imagined.</p><p>Majestic and stylish.</p><p>The two words were enough to describe the HQ of the Magnificent Tang Corporation.</p><p>Tang Xiu then walked on the stairs and passed through the wide fountain square as he came to the entrance of the edifice. There, he saw many people swiping their work cards before entering. Tang Xiu went straight to the two security guards on the left side and said, “I’m Tang Xiu, the owner of this company. However, I don’t have a work card, so get me a temporary one.”</p><p>The Boss? Tang Xiu?</p><p>The two security guards didn’t know Tang Xiu and just exchanged glances, being at a loss of what they should do.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
