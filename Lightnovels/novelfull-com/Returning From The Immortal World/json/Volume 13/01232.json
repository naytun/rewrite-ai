After getting occupied with many issues in the last few days, Tang Xiu finally took a short break. The atmosphere of love was thick as he began taking off his clothes.</p><p><em>BANG… zzzt…</em></p><p>All of a sudden, the whole world seemed to shake, while the doors, windows, and lamps also vibrated. Even the firm-footed bed also rocked. Tang Xiu raised his finger and swore that he and Kang Xia were not the culprits who made everything shake.</p><p>“What’s going on?”</p><p>With a flushed face, Kang Xia quickly looked at the window.</p><p>Tang Xiu slightly frowned and quickly got dressed and moved in a flash to the window. When he looked at the scenery outside, he saw that many people had rushed out of their own dwellings under the dim light, looking around and looked to be at a loss.</p><p><em>Was it an earthquake?</em></p><p>Tang Xiu furrowed his brows. He could still feel the faint tremors, the likes that were very similar to tremors caused by an earthquake.</p><p>“Grand Master.”</p><p>Tang An silently appeared next to him and called out in a low voice.</p><p>“What happened? Do you know the cause of the tremors?” asked Tang Xiu.</p><p>“I have no idea about it, either.” Tang An shook her head and said, “The tremors hit the entire neighborhood and can be felt by everyone else. Could it be a normal earthquake?”</p><p>“It’s unlikely, else it would have caused a big disaster already.” Tang Xiu shook his head.</p><p>Having said that, he dialed Jin Shi’s cell number and asked in a deep tone, “Where are you?”</p><p>“I’m currently in Heilongjiang Province, Sect Master,” answered Jin Shi.</p><p>“A tremor just hit Shanghai. Immediately contact the intel operatives in Shanghai to investigate what happened here,” Tang Xiu ordered.</p><p>“Pardon?” Jin Shi exclaimed and hurriedly said, “You said Shanghai was just hit by the tremors too? The same thing is happening on my side as well, just like an earthquake.”</p><p>Tang Xiu was silent.</p><p>The tremors hit the northern part of the country as well as Shanghai. It gave him a bad feeling. Because he worried that the tremors happened across the country. If it did, then major events would inevitably occur.</p><p>“I’ll carry out the investigation right away, Sect Master.” Jin Shi immediately broke the ice after noticing Tang Xiu’s long pause.</p><p>“Contact those in charge of each city in the country and ask the situations on their side and pass the reports to me as quickly as possible,” said Tang Xiu finally.</p><p>Only five minutes had passed when Jin Shi returned the call. His face turned grim after hearing the report since the information from Jin Shi said that the tremors were felt all over China—a sign that it wasn’t an ordinary event and there was likely a huge danger looming in China.</p><p><em>Ring, ring, ring…</em></p><p>The urgent ringtone suddenly rang from his cell phone. Tang Xiu quickly grabbed it and was a bit stunned and surprised after seeing the caller displayed on the screen.</p><p>“Chen Shaohua?”</p><p>Tang Xiu pondered for a short while. He then pressed the answer button and asked, “Did something happen?”</p><p>Chen Shaohua’s voice replied from the phone, “We got a situation here, Sect Master.”</p><p>“What is it?” asked Tang Xiu in a deep voice as his heart dropped.</p><p>“You assigned me to send some experts to be stationed near the Longquan Mountain in the western region to guard the pocket world there back then, and I just received news from there. Something huge must have happened in that pocket world as tens of fearsome fierce beasts were seen rushing out of the entrance. A few of them are seemingly rushing towards the periphery of Longquan Mountain and will likely pose a huge threat to the civilians outside.”</p><p>Tang Xiu’s complexion changed and he asked in a heavy tone, “Did the tremors happen there as well?”</p><p>“Yeah. It’s quite strong and nearly reached a magnitude of 4 or 5,” Chen Shaohua answered.</p><p>Tang Xiu’s pupils shrunk. He immediately realized that the source of the tremor occurring all over China. It was very likely caused by Longquan Mountain in the western region. With almost no hesitation, he ordered in a deep voice, “I’m heading there right away. Contact everyone over there to stand guard at Longquan Mountain and don’t let any of those fierce beasts leave the mountain range, lest ordinary people see them.”</p><p>“Understood! I’ll notify everyone there immediately. Further, I’ll be heading to the pocket world’s entrance at Longquan Mountain within an hour,” replied Chen Shaohua quickly.</p><p>“Be careful.”</p><p>Tang Xiu hung up and then turned to Kang Xia behind him. He then spoke to her in a deep voice, “I must leave Shanghai. You stay here to tend to your work. Also, pay more attention to the construction project of Magnificent Tang Corp.’s HQ in Shanghai and tell the developer and the construction team to speed up. If possible, divide the work into three shifts, I want it finished in the shortest possible time. We need to move our HQ and factories to Shanghai completely.”</p><p>“Roger. I get it.” Kang Xia nodded.</p><p>Tang Xiu left Paradise Manor and quickly contacted Duanmu Lin and told him about the situation. Then, he finally said, “I don’t know exactly what happened in that pocket world, so I’m heading there as fast as I can. Senior Duanmu, it’s best that you head over there too if you can, and assign some people to block the entire Longquan Mountain to ensure that no fierce beast breaks out. Otherwise, it will cause harm to the natives there.”</p><p>“I’m heading there at once,” Duanmu Lin replied. “Also, you’re still in Shanghai, aren’t you? I’ll send someone to pick you up by chopper to get you there as quickly as possible.”</p><p>“Alright!” Tang Xiu curtly replied.</p><p>****</p><p>Four hours later, Tang Xiu was escorted by a military helicopter and finally arrived near Longquan Mountain after stopping over at some places along the way.</p><p>Only Tang An followed him this time, but both were very powerful and quickly entered the interior of the mountain range after jumping off the army chopper.</p><p>Quickly after, Tang Xiu and Tang An halted their advance when a figure appeared in front of them. It was Chen Shaohua who had arrived here ahead of time. The man was drenched wet in blood at this moment and seemed to have just crawled out from a blood pond. However, there was a piece of scaly flesh on his shoulder which should be from a fierce beast.</p><p>“Brief me the current situation!”</p><p>Tang Xiu dashed towards Chen Shaohua’s front and inquired while his hand quickly took out a Holy Healing pill from the interspatial ring and stuffed it into the man’s mouth.</p><p>Chen Shaohua quickly swallowed the pill and shot a grateful look at Tang Xiu. He didn’t even wait for the medicine to be absorbed fully and hurriedly said, “The number of fierce beasts rushing out of that pocket world keeps increasing and I only brought a dozen people here. Added with those who have been stationed here, we only have 16 people in total. We have killed hundreds of fierce beasts in the last four-plus hours, but these beasts are too scattered and we can’t stop them all. However, the intel department just contacted me and they are sure that no fierce beasts have rushed out of the forested mountain range, so no disaster will happen to the locals living in the vicinity. At least for the time being.”</p><p>“That’s good to hear.” Tang Xiu nodded and said, “I’ve notified some people from the state about this. We can expect to have a large number of experts here soon. By the way, is there anyone from our side watching the entrance to that pocket world?”</p><p>“We only have a few people here, but we do have some staying there. It’s just that we have hidden the fallen ones secretly.” Chen Shaohua replied, “They immediately moved to kill these fierce beasts if the number that rushing out was few. I told them to avoid the beasts if their number is too many and too strong for them to face.”</p><p>“How long does it take to get there from here?” asked Tang Xiu.</p><p>“About an hour and a half,” Chen Shaohua said.</p><p>Tang Xiu then grabbed his shoulder and said, “Show me the way. I’ll take you there.”</p><p>Reaching the pocket world’s entrance indeed would take an hour and a half according to Chen Shaohua’s speed since his cultivation was only at the Golden Core Stage. However, Tang Xiu’s speed was extremely fast and it took him only 20 minutes while towing Chen Shaohua.</p><p>“Sect Master!”</p><p>Four disciples of Tang Sect in black robes and swords in their hands immediately approached and greeted.</p><p>Tang Xiu looked at the scars on their bodies and took out four Holy Healing pills and gave it to them each. Then, he said, “You’ve worked hard. How is the situation here?”</p><p>“The total number of fierce beasts 1,160, Sect Master.” One of them respectfully answered, “Some of them are very strong, and from their aura, we estimate that these particular ones should be comparable to a Golden Core Stage cultivator. The rest of these fierce beasts only have very average strength with only a few comparable to Foundation Establishment Stage, while most of them are only at the Qi Refining Stage.”</p><p>Tang Xiu nodded without a word. Then, he looked at Chen Shaohua and said, “Keep hunting and killing these fierce beasts. Jin Shi and all members of the Tang Sect in the mainland will be here soon. Keep this interspatial ring and store all the remains of the fierce beasts you’ve slain.”</p><p>Chen Shaohua’s eyes lit up and immediately received it excitedly. He had heard about the rumors that every Tang Sect disciples who had received an interspatial ring from Tang Xiu would finally keep the ring as their private property. Prior to this, he had been dreaming of having such an interspatial ring. However, he hadn’t performed many merits yet, so he never had the chance to obtain it. But now, his dreams had finally come true.</p><p>Tang Xiu shifted to Tang An and said, “We’re going to enter this pocket world. I wanna see what’s exactly going on inside.”</p><p>“No, you can’t, Sect Master!”</p><p>Before Tang An replied to Tang Xiu, Chen Shaohua got startled and hurriedly called out to stop him.</p><p>“What’s wrong?” Tang Xiu frowned.</p><p>“I entered this pocket world previously, Sect Master. That’s why I know how dangerous it is inside.” Chen Shaohua hurriedly replied, “Especially that black dragon I found there. That thing is simply horribly terrifying. This subordinate can’t let Sect Master go inside personally and take the risk.”</p><p>Tang Xiu patted his shoulder with a smile and said, “I understand your concern, but don’t worry about that! My present power is much stronger than before. I can still protect myself even if I’m not a match for that black dragon.”</p><p>Chen Shaohua opened his mouth and wanted to speak out more, but after seeing Tang Xiu’s eyes turn sharp, he finally swallowed back the words he was about to say and nodded wordlessly.</p><p>Tang Xiu then shifted his vision to the entrance while secretly raising his vigilance. As he entered, he spoke to Tang An, who followed him, “Remember to withdraw at once if you sense something wrong. Many pocket worlds have a lot of treasure, but they are also fraught with fatal dangers.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
