After having a smooth ride to find a gas station, Tang Xiu then found one gas station jam-packed with a lot of people. He could see cars lining up, but nobody was refueling at all.</p><p>“Hey, what’s going on here?”</p><p>Tang Xiu opened the window and found the window of another Mercedes-Benz SUV was also opened. He slightly furrowed his brows and asked a man with tattoos on his shoulders who was smoking and taking a puff once in a while.</p><p>The man glanced at Tang Xiu and seemingly didn’t want to reply ar first. But the boredom due to waiting for too long got to him, and he casually replied, “What other reasons can it be except for these driving school’s instructors who come to refuel at this hour every day? We all just have to wait until they’re done filling up before our turn comes.”</p><p>Tang Xiu furrowed his brows and asked again, “Why haven’t I seen any of vehicles from car driving schools here, though? Do these people have some big heads that we should all wait for them?”</p><p>The man puffed out a cloud of smoke and suddenly smiled, asking, “Are you not a native, Brother? You have no idea about the unspoken rules here?”</p><p>“Nah, I’m not a local. I’m just passing by.” Tang Xiu shook his head.</p><p>A smile sported on the man’s face and he replied, “No wonder! Then, let me tell you about it. This gas station is, in fact, owned by the principal of the only driving school in the city. The reason why he built a gas station here is mainly for his driving school. Usually, there are only a few cars from the driving school coming to refuel since they come in batches. But those who happen to come here when so many of these cars are coming will be unlucky since there won’t be enough gas for them.”</p><p>Tang Xiu nodded with a smile and asked again, “Do you perhaps have a feud with the owner of this gas station, though?”</p><p>The man zoned out and then shook his head. “How could I harbor anything like that? There’s nothing between me and him.”</p><p>“Since you have no feud with the owner of this gas station, then why are you here and dare to smoke so brazenly, then?” Tang Xiu asked with a smile, “Are you not afraid the gas station will catch fire and explode?”</p><p>The man gave Tang Xiu a strange look. He immediately threw the cigarette butt on the ground and blandly replied, “You’re really paying to safety, aren’t you, Little Brother?”</p><p>He then shut his car’s windows directly after saying that.</p><p>Tang Xiu shook his head secretly and waited calmly for more than half an hour before he saw a dozen training cars with signs “Red Maple Driving School” slowly move from the distance. Only after he waited for another half an hour did his turn come.</p><p>“Fill up to the full,” Tang Xiu calmly said after his turn came.</p><p>The gas station’s staff nodded in response and then glanced at the back. After filling up the tank to the full and Tang Xiu gave her the cash, she toned down her voice and said, “You’re not a local given your license plate, aren’t you, Little Brother? You had better leave this place quickly if you’re from around here!”</p><p>Tang Xiu raised his brows and asked, “Why?”</p><p>“The car owners who come to our gas station to refuel and find non-natives driving cars here often sneakily follow behind to rob them,” the staff whispered. “You should be careful too since I think you’re alone.”</p><p>“Thanks a bunch,” Tang Xiu replied smilingly.</p><p>After restarting his car, Tang Xiu quickly headed for the highway, but he found through the rearview mirror that the tattooed man who he spoke with before didn’t refuel his car but drove behind him instead.</p><p>“Interesting.”</p><p>Tang Xiu squinted and pushed the gas pedal to the bottom and his car turned as though an arrow that dashed fast to the distance. At the same time, he dialed the local police emergency number. After speaking about the issue, he finally said, “You may not believe me, but I’m from the Security Department who passed by this place after a mission. I’m now in the Bailu District and I’ll park at the gate of the Bailu District’s Zhongchuang Primary School to wait for these people to come to me. I’ll hold you responsible if you don’t come, and you can expect to have severe consequences!”</p><p>Quite far behind, a fierce expression flashed in the eyes of the tattooed man driving the Mercedes-Benz SUV. While quickly chasing the car in front, he said in a deep tone, “Baozi, you speed up to intercept this guy in front later. You are to intercept this guy once he drives out of the city at the East Bridge. Shit! We may all drive Mercedes-Benz, but his car is definitely several times more expensive than mine. He’s definitely a fat sheep!”</p><p>“No worries! I’ll get him to stop there!” A confident voice came out of the phone assured him.</p><p>At the gate of Bailu District’s Zhongchuang Primary School.</p><p>The primary school was already emptied since it was early in the evening. There were only a few pedestrians in the vicinity aside from several teenagers who were smoking in front of the store across the school. Yet, no one noticed the Mercedes-Benz SUV parked in front of the school.</p><p>“Hey, you two! Come over here.”</p><p>Tang Xiu lit up a cigarette while leaning on the car’s door after he got out, and then looked at the teenagers and waved at them.</p><p>“You called, Brother?”</p><p>The four teenagers came quickly. Envious looks on their faces were visible when they glanced at the Mercedes-Benz SUV from time to time.</p><p>Tang Xiu took a stack of money from his wallet. The sum was about 1,000 yuan in cash, and he handed it to the teenager in front and said, “Do me a favor and you can have the money.”</p><p>The teenager took the money and looked excited. Then, he stuttered, “B-Brother, what… what do you want us to do?”</p><p>“You got a cell phone?” asked Tang Xiu.</p><p>The teenager quickly took out a smartphone. Although the price of his cell phone was not very expensive, it was a brand-new one. The teenage boy then said, “We all have mobile phones, Brother.”</p><p>“Call the cops now and tell ’em that there’s a violent incident at the gate of Bailu Primary School. Tell them to hurry up here. Each of you four, call the cops and leave this place immediately.”</p><p>“This…”</p><p>The four teenagers hesitated.</p><p>Calling and reporting to the police was never a joking matter. They would be detained if it was just a prank. However, they finally gritted their teeth after looking at the notes in their hands. “Let’s call the cops, Brothers!”</p><p>Tang Xiu patted their shoulders and smilingly said, “No worries, Boys! You won’t get in any problems at all. You may become heroes after calling and reporting to the cops since the said violence will soon happen here.”</p><p><em>Creak…</em></p><p><em>Creak…</em></p><p>A black SUV was parked behind Tang Xiu’s car and followed by three others on both sides. As the doors of these cars were opened, several big men then gushed out with evil and hideous grins on their faces.</p><p>“These guys…”</p><p>The four teenagers looked a bit pale and hurriedly shifted to Tang Xiu and asked, “Brother, who are these guys? Are they looking for you for trouble?”</p><p>“Yup.” Tang Xiu nodded and said, “They should be here to find some troubles with me.”</p><p>The boys’ leader looked at his other three companions quickly and looked hesitant. He then shifted to Tang Xiu and said in a low voice, “Brother, can you give us more money? Three… no, five grand. Give us another five grand and I assure you that we’ll help you deal with them without calling the cops.”</p><p>A weird look appeared on Tang Xiu’s face when he saw that the other three boys also nodded. He suddenly couldn’t help laughing and said, “How can you help me, though?”</p><p>“Do we have a deal or not?” the leader of the boys looked a bit anxious as those big men approached closer.</p><p>“Deal.” Tang Xiu smoked his cigarette again after replying.</p><p>The teenager’s eyes lit up and he grabbed his cell phone to dial a cell number. About six-plus seconds after, he shouted, “Ah Lang, someone just gave us money to help deal with some problems here. Go get some others and bring ’em here fast! We’re at the gate of the primary school!”</p><p>The other three boys also made phone calls and called someone else to come over quickly.</p><p>The weird expression on Tang Xiu’s face grew more intense. He was really at a loss whether he had to cry or laugh after watching these four guys make a phone call to summon some others one after another. “You know, I’m afraid I’ll be beaten to death already when the fellas you just called arrive here. Just listen to me and leave this place quickly, will you?”</p><p>The boys’ leader stubbornly shook his head and said aloud, “What’s your name, Brother? Mine is Wang Hu, the tiger of the mountain, and the younger brother of mine is called Ah Long. Just wait here for a while and he’ll bring some others quickly.”</p><p>Tang Xiu felt a bit helpless inwardly. Then, he shifted his attention to more than a dozen of aggressive and fierce-looking big men coming over as he paced forward to face them and smilingly said, “We meet again, Dude.”</p><p>The tattooed man gave a thumbs up and exclaimed in praise, “Well, well. You seem to have found some helpers, don’t you? How many people can you summon with these brats? I’m not afraid to tell you my name. I’m Yang Biao and I made quite a name for myself in this city, and those buddies on the street call me Brother Biao.”</p><p>Tang Xiu shook his head and said, “They…”</p><p>Suddenly, he stopped speaking abruptly since he saw tens of teenagers rushing out of the alley tens of meters away behind these dozen big men. The boys were about 17-plus-years-old and some of them were holding machetes and some others had iron tongs.</p><p>“We’re here, Brothers!”</p><p>The running young man at the forefront had a bulky figure and a height of more than 1.8 meters. Anyone who saw him would have thought that he was an adult if it wasn’t for his boyish face.</p><p>“All Brothers, this big brother promised to give us 5 grand to help him deal with his trouble,” Wang Hu said aloud. “And this bunch of shits is gonna trouble this big brother!”</p><p>“Fuck them!”</p><p>“Beat the shit out of ’em!”</p><p>“Don’t let them run!”</p><p>More than a dozen teenagers raised their weapons and quickly surrounded a dozen adults. The boys looked like ferocious small tigers, and their stances showed that they were ready to rumble for the showdown at any time.</p><p>“Giddy-up! Quickly get over there!”</p><p>Another group of five teenagers approached quickly, also holding weapons. The boys’ leader who came the last, the one with red-dyed-hair, called out, “Hey, Brother Hu, who the fuck dares bully our rich donor? Let’s beat the shit out of ’em!”</p><p>The tattoed man’s face changed, whereas the rest of the dozen big men looked incredulous. Never did they expect that the call from these four boys could actually summon so many others at once.</p><p>However, the matter was still far from over. In just 4-plus minutes later, 9 groups of boys also rushed over, some made up of more than a dozen people and the fewer one consisting of 6 boys. A dozen of boys even rushed over on their bikes to join the encirclement.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
