Then, he spoke in a deep tone, “We’re in troubling times now. Even though the chance is unlikely, you had better call Haoran immediately and ask him if he’s related to this incident.”</p><p>Chen Shuo picked up his cell phone, but his call was hung up just as he dialed his son, Chen Haoran’s phone.</p><p>“What happened?” asked Chen Xintao.</p><p>“He didn’t pick up my call and just hung up,” Chen Shuo replied with a forced smile.</p><p>Chen Xintao was about to reply when he suddenly noticed a figure coming from the outside. He then nodded. “You’re back, Haoran. There’s something I need to ask you.”</p><p>Chen Haoran’s lips twitched. He walked to the front of Chen Xintao, knelt down and bitterly said, “I may have made some big mistakes, Grandpa.”</p><p>Chen Xintao and Chen Shuo exchanged glances and a bad feeling grew inside their hearts. Chen Xintao then asked in a deep voice, “Tell me, were you also involved in the incident when Su Xiaoguang offended Tang Xiu?”</p><p>Chen Haoran hesitated and then answered, “I think I’ve offended him as well, Grandpa.”</p><p>BAM…</p><p>Although Chen Xintao was very old, his movement when he got up and moved was swift. He kicked Chen Haoran’s chest and knocked him to the floor, shouting, “Tell me what the hell happened from the start. Do not miss a word!”</p><p>Chen Haoran’s lips wriggled and he told the whole story. Then, he finally said bitterly, “It was just a small contradiction, but it was Su Xiaoguang who insulted Tang Xiu. I didn’t say anything.”</p><p>A cold light flashed in Chen Xintao’s eyes. After a few minutes of contemplation, he lit a cigarette, took a deep breath and then said, “Shuo’er, withdraw the funds of our family and transfer some money to a bank card. Then bring Haoran to House Tang’s residence to apologize.”</p><p>Chen Shuo hesitated. “But… how much I should prepare, Father?”</p><p>Chen Xintao pinched down the cigarette impatiently and paced back and forth a few times. Then, he shook his head and said, “Forget it! I’ll go to House Tang myself. Prepare 1 billion yuan and 2 billion more as a reserve fund. The Tangs used a method to kill a chicken to warn the monkeys, and they aimed their butcher knife to the Sus this time. But our family must not take this incident lightly, so we must move fast to apologize. It’s best to make it known to others that our family is bowing our heads to House Tang.”</p><p>“I’ll do it right away. The money will be prepared in 10 minutes.” Chen Shu strode out of the door and disappeared from Chen Xintao’s and Chen Haoran’s sights.</p><p>Chen Xintao took a deep breath and then looked at his pale grandson, asking him indifferently, “What lesson did you take from this incident?”</p><p>“I understand the truth that I must never be fooled by false impression and that I must never easily provoke anyone,” answered Chen Haoran bitterly.</p><p>Finally, a look of relief appeared on Chen Xintao’s face and he nodded. “Take this incident as a good lesson! It’s better to spend money to avoid disasters than forever remain ignorant of how deep the world is. Keep in mind that there are always unusual variables behind every strange incident. House Tang left only Tang Yunpeng and Tang Xiu, whereas the rest of them have disappeared, but that doesn’t mean they have fallen already. If my guess is correct, they must have a big plan on the motion.”</p><p>“What big plan could it be, Grandpa?” asked Chen Haoran.</p><p>“Who do I ask even if you ask me?” Chen Xintao shook his head. “I can tell some people with quite the background all over China are also pondering about this matter as well.”</p><p>****</p><p>At House Tang’s residence.</p><p>Tang Yunpeng was silently sitting cross-legged in the room in cultivation. However, a knock on the door made him slowly open his eyes and ask in a deep voice, “Is there something up?”</p><p>“There are some people outside asking to meet you, Patriarch. They are the Head of Chen Family in Beijing, Chen Xintao, and his grandson, Chen Haoran,” the voice of his secretary outside the door replied to him.</p><p>Tang Yunpeng furrowed his brows and looked annoyed. He could just ignore the guest if it was someone else, but Chen Xintao was, after all, the Head of an affluent family who also possessed considerable energy in the capital. Therefore, he nodded and said, “Alright, take them to the guest room. I’ll see them soon.”</p><p>“Understood!” The secretary outside the room replied. Then, he came in, approached and said, “Patriarch, I think it’s best to call Tang Xiu first. This should be about the incident that happened outside that’s related to our House.”</p><p>“I see.”</p><p>After replying, Tang Yunpeng took his mobile phone and inquired about it. A strange expression painted his solemn face after he heard Tang Xiu’s explanation. Even though Tang Xiu was not in front of him, he still raised his thumbs up and praised. “You took care of it beautifully, Xiu’er.”</p><p>“I’ve already accomplished everything I should handle here, First Uncle. Things will be much better for our family in the future if you really got transferred to Shanghai later,” said Tang Xiu with a chuckle.</p><p>“I know Duanmu Lin’s character. He’s always very cautious in doing things, so I’m sure he has taken care of everything since he has said so. I’m going to wait, for now. I believe the decision will come out soon,” Tang Yunpeng said.</p><p>“That would be great, then.” Tang Xiu chuckled and then said, “Anyhow, First Uncle, I need to leave Beijing tonight for Shanghai to tend to something. Also, I’ll carry out another big plan after you come to Shanghai and formally settle down.”</p><p>“What plan?” asked Tang Yunpeng.</p><p>“Well, I’m keeping it a secret about that for now until you come to Shanghai, though.” Tang Xiu said, “It’s likely that I’m going to need your assistance, so I’ll naturally tell you about it later.”</p><p>“Haih, you’re really mystifying things, brat.” Tang Xiu laughed and then said, “Alright, then. I won’t ask since you don’t want to tell me now. Anyway, the Head of Chen Family, Chen Xintao, and his grandson, Chen Haoran just came to see me. Their visit should be related to you, shouldn’t it?”</p><p>“Well, I don’t have a plan to deal with them at the moment, though. You can call the shots if they come to apologize, regardless of the compensation they offer, Uncle. But if they come to court more trouble, please contact me and I’ll deal with them.”</p><p>Tang Yunpeng then went to the living room after hanging up. But the moment he saw Chen Xintao and Chen Haoran, Chen Xintao directly moved and knelt in front of him.</p><p>“What are you doing, Patriarch Chen?” Tang Yunpeng intentionally acted surprised and asked.</p><p>“Yunpeng, we’re old acquaintances, but this wastrel grandson of mine has offended Tang Xiu. That’s why I came personally and dragged him here to apologize.” Chen Xintao wryly smiled.</p><p>“Eh, what exactly happened, though?” Tang Yunpeng acted bewildered.</p><p>“It’s just a minor spat between youngsters, but I felt that it won’t be over so easily.” Chen Xintao reluctantly explained, “If anything, House Tang is currently garnering the attention of many people and I’m afraid that those concerned are having wild speculations right now. That’s the reason why I brought this good-for-nothing grandson of mine here to apologize. It will also serve as a message to them that House Tang is still the original House Tang and even much stronger.”</p><p>Tang Yunpeng let out a light smile and grabbed Chen Xintao to prop him up. Then, he smilingly said, “It’s just a minor fight between children, there’s no need for us to get involved as their guardians. Please have a seat, Elder Chen.”</p><p>Instead of taking a seat directly, Chen Xintao took out a bank card and handed it to Tang Yunpeng, saying, “Yunpeng, I know Tang Xiu has a magnanimous personality and he’s also a good child, but it’s not like he deserves a loss. There’s a small sum of money in this card, please take it as a token of apology from my family. The PIN is written on the back. Also, please speak well to Tang Xiu about this.”</p><p>“About this…” Tang Yunpeng put on an awkward expression on purpose.</p><p>“Doesn’t Tang Xiu still listen to your words, Yunpeng?” asked Chen Xintao.</p><p>“Like he dares not to.” Tang Yunpeng immediately blurted out. “I’m still his First Uncle and that brat must hear what I tell him.”</p><p>“That’s right. It’s a virtue of the young to respect their elders, to begin with.” Chen Xintao nodded and said, “If anything, it will be up to you to handle this matter. Anyway, it’s rather late now, so I won’t disturb you anymore.”</p><p>Tang Yunpeng hesitated for a moment and then intentionally asked, “Why don’t you stay for a cup of tea, Elder Chen?”</p><p>“Nah, it’s too late already.” Chen Xintao shook his head. “I’ll invite you to some drinks later.”</p><p>“Alright, then. But it will be my treat.”</p><p>Tang Yunpeng sent Chen Xintao and Chen Haoran to the front gate and watched them leave. When his secretary approached, Tang Yunpeng gave him the bank card and said, “Check how much money is in this card.”</p><p>“Understood!”</p><p>A few minutes later, his secretary quickly came back and said, “There’s 1 billion yuan in it, Patriarch.”</p><p>“The Chens are really sincere on this matter.” Tang Yunpeng raised his brows and immediately said smilingly, “Alright, take this bank card and go to the Special Abilities Bureau by yourself and give it to Director Duanmu Lin. Tell him that it’s a token from House Tang to buy some equipment for the guardians in the Special Abilities Bureau.”</p><p>“Isn’t this… a bit too much?” The secretary hesitated.</p><p>Tang Yunpeng chuckled. “Do you think 1 billion yuan is too much compared to the protection the Special Abilities Bureau provides for our House? No matter how good the personal relationship between Duanmu Lin and Tang Xiu, we brought some people from the Special Abilities Bureau to help us. Some people among them must be unhappy due to that. Everyone in the world always seeks profits as it is the most reasonable thing to get involved in anything. It’s likely everyone in the Special Abilities Bureau will shut their mouths once we send this money over.”</p><p>“You’re wise, Patriarch.”</p><p>****</p><p>The news that the Head of the Chen Family, Chen Xintao, brought his grandson, Chen Haoran, to visit House Tang’s residence to apologize quickly spread out, and was soon known by many forces and families. It was the Chens themselves who released the news.</p><p>In that instant, the circle of affluent families in the capital was in an uproar and the news shook many influential families and powerful parties all over China. The news made them incredulous and they finally realized that House Tang turned out to not have fallen. Even though many of House Tang’s members had disappeared, this family was still terrifying.</p><p>The next day.</p><p>The news of misfortune that had befallen the Su Family and the uproar caused by the apology of the Chen Family had yet to fade away, but another piece of news had spread out to every region in China yet again:</p><p>“Tang Yunpeng of House Tang has left his previous post and is now assigned to hold his new post in Shanghai. Due to his outstanding performance and abilities, as well as his professionalism and dedication to the state and the people, he now serves as the Deputy of the Ministry of Culture.”</p><p>The moment this news came out, everyone felt a heavy pressure as this foreshadowed that House Tang still had a genuine pillar and still stood as a behemoth even without its previous patriarch, Tang Guosheng.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
