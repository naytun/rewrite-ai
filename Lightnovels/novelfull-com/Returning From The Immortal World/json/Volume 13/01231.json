The boundless horizon over the sky of Shanghai was so clear that its blue sky was as though it had just been washed by water.</p><p>At Paradise Manor.</p><p>Tang Xiu was quietly sitting in a hundred-plus square meters spacious room while holding a cup of hot tea. He looked at the four people sitting in front of him, Duanmu Lin, Tang Yunpeng, Mo Yi, and Kang Xia.</p><p>“Tang Xiu, we have all drank two cups of tea and waited for you for a while here. You told me on the phone that you have a big plan in mind. What exactly is it? Don’t keep us guessing here, will you?” Duanmu Lin put down his teacup with a helpless expression on his aged face.</p><p>“I should have gone to the municipal office to report now, Xiu’er. But I rushed over directly at your call.” Tang Yunpeng nodded and said, “Don’t blame me if I get mad at you if you don’t have anything important.”</p><p>Tang Xiu put down the teacup and smilingly said, “I’d like to ask a question first before I get to the important point, though. What do you think about the current standard of science and technology on Earth?”</p><p>Duanmu Lin and Tang Yunpeng exchanged glances, while Mo Yi and Kang Xia looked confused. They had no idea how to answer Tang Xiu’s question.</p><p>After a long while, Duanmu Lin slowly said, “Humanity has made rapid progress in science and technology and we have many high-tech products which are much better than in the past.”</p><p>“And what about its comparison to the technology in the three-star vestige?” asked Tang Xiu again.</p><p>“How can it be compared with it?” Duanmu Lin forced a wry smile and said, “It’s just worlds apart! If the level of science and tech on Earth can reach the level of tech found in three-star vestige, it’s very likely that we’d have ventured out of Earth towards the stars.”</p><p>“That’s exactly my point,” Tang Xiu said. “I invited all of you here today so that humanity can venture out of the Earth and march towards the stars. I want to make a qualitative leap in regards to science and technological power we can control in a decade. I hope that humanity can explore the entire galaxy and form an interstellar fleet in two decades. In three decades, I hope humanity can develop and govern the entire Milky Way and make it an impregnable bastion so we can call this star territory our own.”</p><p>“Hahaha, quit joking with us, Tang Xiu.” Duanmu Lin shook his head and laughed. “If science and tech on Earth can reach this level, and if humanity could reach such a situation, that would simply…”</p><p>Suddenly, he noticed a faint smile on Tang Xiu’s face and the next words got stuck in this throat. Based on what he knew about Tang Xiu’s character, Tang Xiu was not one who liked to talk nonsensical things. He must have confidence that it could be achieved since he mentioned it.</p><p>But still, wasn’t that too far-fetched an idea?</p><p>Tang Xiu took a deep breath and his smile gradually disappeared as he solemnly said, “Senior Duanmu, you had your own interest with your duties and I had my own concerns back when we were not on the same boat. That’s why I’ve never told you about one thing. But now, I can tell you about it.”</p><p>“What is it?” Duanmu Lin’s expression shifted and he hurriedly asked.</p><p>Tang Xiu said, “Do you still remember the three-star vestige I’ve explored, the one located at the ‘sea crossroad’ of Malacca Straits which west part belongs to Myanmar Sea and its south part connects the South China Sea? The channel length is about 1080km long ad its southeast lane connects the Pacific Ocean to the Indian Ocean. It’s the newly discovered three-star vestige at the bottom of the sea. Does that ring a bell?”</p><p>“Yeah.” Duanmu Lin nodded.</p><p>“This three-star vestige is opened for a limited time and various countries have been trying to explore and excavate the entire site to obtain more advanced tech, is that right?” said Tang Xiu.</p><p>“That’s correct.” Duanmu Lin nodded again.</p><p>“People in all countries are said to be at a loss on how to deal with this vestige, but I can tell you that this three-star vestige is completely under my control,” Tang Xiu said. “You can say that I’m its owner and I can use every tech there, from which I also obtained the SmartBrain of this vestige which contains a lot of scientific and technological knowledge far beyond the level of Earth. If I have three conditions fulfilled, which are time, funds, and manpower, I can also create a high-tech world.”</p><p>“Come again!?”</p><p>Shock covered Duanmu Lin’s face as he looked at Tang Xiu with disbelief. He couldn’t help trembling despite having formidable strength.</p><p>“You haven’t heard wrong,” Tang Xiu said with all seriousness. “I have full control of the three-star vestige and I can enter and leave the remains at any time. You can say that I own all the tech products there and I can even use all the scientific and technological knowledge stored there. Senior Duanmu, to tell you the truth, that vestige is actually a huge interstellar battleship and I can control it completely. I can even activate and drive it out of Earth into the depths of the universe.”</p><p>Duanmu Lin gulped down. He could hardly express his emotions when he looked at Tang Xiu’s serious face.</p><p>It was an utter shock that brought along with it a horrifying feeling.</p><p>If Tang Xiu’s claims were true, then he was absolutely capable of becoming the true Master of Earth if he did something behind his back. Facing such fearsome advanced scientific and technological power, humanity’s technological level was simply like garbage and could be easily destroyed.</p><p>Tang Yunpeng glanced at Duanmu Lin before his eyes focused on Tang Xiu. He then asked seriously, “What exactly do you want to do, Xiu’er?”</p><p>“My departure from Earth in the future is inevitable,” Tang Xiu said. “Inevitably, all members of the Tang Sect will also follow me, including the four of you. But Earth is our roots and the place where I grew up. We can leave this place, but I must guarantee that it will exist forever. I do not wish to see it destroyed when I return someday, nor do I want to see humanity go extinct.</p><p>“Of course, there’s also another possibility that could happen in about a few decades, centuries, or millenniums after we leave, where we’ll find that humanity has been invaded by some other races in the universe. The weak dwellers of Earth may become slaves or even the livestock for these extraterrestrials, either that or humans on earth have all been massacred completely.</p><p>“I may not a great man, but I want to give Earth a contingency plan and a guarantee before I leave. At least humanity can protect itself when facing a powerful alien race. That’s why possessing formidable and advanced science and tech is a must. Humanity must control a wide range of territory, at least the entire Milky Way. I want to build countless forces and a formidable defense network, as well as an interstellar armada to make the entire Milky Way an impregnable bastion.”</p><p>Tang Yunpeng, Mo Yi, and Kang Xia abruptly got up with shocked expressions. Deep respect aroused in their hearts and they heavily nodded at Tang Xiu.</p><p>To protect their homes and country.</p><p>Tang Xiu was a formidable individual, but he also considered the possibility of his home being invaded by aliens in the future. Such a character, as well as the thoughts to prepare for such rainy days, was truly admirable.</p><p>“Please elaborate more about your idea, Tang Xiu,” Duanmu Lin asked slowly.</p><p>“I need a secret base, one that is large enough, remote and inaccessible.” Tang Xiu said, “The next step would be to invest enormous financial and material resources along with manpower. Within the first two years, set up a school to teach them the scientific and technological knowledge in the three-star vestige as fast as possible. At the same time, we also need to build secret bases to manufacture interstellar battleships and train the needed soldiers to man these ships.”</p><p>“Do you want to carry this project yourself, or do you want to mobilize the entire country machine to carry it out?” asked Duanmu Lin again.</p><p>“This is not the kind of work that can be carried out by individuals,” Tang Xiu said. “I will need the support of the country, but the confidentiality of the project must be put at the highest level. In the future, be it the manufactured starships, or the starship troopers we train, all of them must belong to our country.”</p><p>“It would be impossible to conceal it if you make such big movements for the project at this scale in a short time,” Duanmu Lin spoke again. “Moreover, the number of resources required is so colossal that it won’t be realistic to carry this out while maintaining full secrecy.”</p><p>“Give me 10 years.” Tang Xiu said in a deep tone, “I’ll preside over the overall situation and you will assist me in handling this issue. I’ll then hand over the bases to the country 10 years later.”</p><p>“I need to report this to the higher-ups first,” Duanmu Lin said.</p><p>“That would be great. It’d best if I can talk to them in person,” Tang Xiu said.</p><p>Duanmu Lin got up and said, “Tang Xiu, I’ll invite the three Seniors of the state. And I’m looking forward to future development if you can convince them.”</p><p>“Alright!” Tang Xiu nodded and sent Duanmu Lin off.</p><p>Afterward, there were only Tang Xiu, Tang Yunpeng, Mo Yi, and Kang Xia remaining in the room. Tang Xiu looked at Tang Yunpeng and said, “First Uncle, I admit that this decision was made due to my selfishness. It is my hope that you can also go further in the future. The Tang Family needs escort from you for the purpose.”</p><p>Tang Yunpeng nodded. “No worries.”</p><p>Tang Xiu then shifted to Mo Yi and said, “Professor Mo, you’re a scientist and expert researcher. I hope you can become the chief engineer for the following major plan. I need you to form a team of technical personnel from which the starships will be manufactured in the future.”</p><p>“Tang Xiu, you have my word that I’ll live up to your expectations on this one. I’m ready to sacrifice the short remaining years of my life for it,” Mo Yi replied excitedly.</p><p>“Hahaha. Well, that will be all, then.” Tang Xiu laughed and said, “Professor Yi, First Uncle, you both can tend to your business and prepare in advance. I believe it won’t be long before this plan will be approved.”</p><p>Tang Yunpeng patted Tang Xiu’s shoulder and directly left. Only after he and Mo Yi disappeared from the room did Tang Xiu look at Kang Xia.</p><p>Kang Xia didn’t utter any words. They were now the only ones left here, so she went straight to him and hugged him gently. She exerted her strength and hugged him tighter.</p><p>Tang Xiu patted her shoulder and chuckled. “Dear, we’re going to be much busier with the Magnificent Tang Corporation since I will need a colossal amount of money and wealth. Let alone 1 trillion, even 100 trillion and 1 quintillion yuan won’t be enough for our purpose.”</p><p>“I stubbornly believed that you’re the best man in the world back then,” Kang Xia murmured. “My vision back then proved out to be true now. From now on, I’ll be in charge of making money and you’ll be responsible for handling the rest of the affairs.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
