Exposing the agreement between us and destroying my company’s reputation is something I can’t accept.”</p><p>Jezek looked ecstatic as he was sure he could find the bastard who took the video. Filming was something that would leave some clues behind, and what were werewolves very good at when facing such a situation? He was sure that his inborn nature as a werewolf in hearing and smelling could yield some unexpected results.</p><p>Certainly, he didn’t make this decision recklessly as he still had another card at hand. That was buying the intel from the fearsomely resourceful Darkwind organization. He could buy the information from this organization should he fail to find the person who shot the video.</p><p>A few minutes later, Jezek left the HQ of Magnificent Tang Corp. with satisfaction. He didn’t notice that Tang Xiu was sneering at him and watched him leave by the window of the conference room where he had just met him.</p><p>10 PM.</p><p>Tang Xiu had just returned to South Gate Town when he saw his mother, Su Lingyun, holding hands with Andy, seemingly merrily engaged in a talk about something. While walking toward the villa, they also carried some bags full of stuff as if they had just finished shopping.</p><p>Honk, honk…</p><p>Tang Xiu blew the car’s horn and stopped the car near the two women, opened the car’s door and smilingly said, “I heard you’ve gone to Beijing, Mom. When did you come back?”</p><p>A pleasantly surprised expression was cast on Su Lingyun’s face when she saw Tang Xiu. She smilingly replied, “I heard that you’ve returned to Star City, so I hurried back. I just arrived this evening and wanted to call you. But then I bumped into Andy and she said you went to your company and there seemed to be something important you needed to tend to. That’s why I didn’t call you. Anyhow, Xiu’er, you should be staying for a longer time in Star City this time, right?”</p><p>“Yeah, I think I’ll stay much longer this time if nothing happens, Mom.” Tang Xiu smilingly replied, “Anyways, get in the car, Mom, Andy!”</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>After Su Lingyun and Andy boarded, they quickly headed home. However, just as the mother and son hadn’t yet starterd to chat, a female who was responsible to protect Su Lingyun and assigned to stay in South Gate Tow entered the living room hurriedly just as they arrived.</p><p>“What did you say? Duanmu Lin?”</p><p>Tang Xiu raised his brows with a slightly surprised expression. He did guess that Duanmu Lin would come for him, but he didn’t expect he would come so fast. It was just only a few hours after the footage spread out, wasn’t it? Could it be that Duanmu Lin was currently in Star City or a city nearby?</p><p>Immediately after, Tang Xiu personally greeted Duanmu Lin. Seeing that the old man brought two God’s Nectar bottles, he squeezed out a wry smile and said, “What did you bring the wine for, Senior Duanmu? I may not have many things here, but I can guarantee I have enough God’s Nectar for everyone to drink!”</p><p>“I know you got a lot of God’s Nectar wine since you’re the one who produces it!” replied Duanmu Lin smilingly. “But I’m afraid I won’t have supper without some wine, you know!”</p><p>Tang Xiu couldn’t help laughing in response. Then, he invited Duanmu Lin inside. After his mother and Duanmu Lin exchanged some pleasantries and she went to the kitchen in a hurry, he and Duanmu Lin headed to the study on the second floor.</p><p>“Tell me, what did you just do, Boy?” Duanmu Lin looked at Tang Xiu asked with a faint smile just as he took a seat on the sofa.</p><p>Tang Xiu rubbed his hands and grinningly replied, “Well, it seems I can never escape your eyes no matter what I do, Senior Duanmu! Nothing worth any concern since there’s no major event. My friend, Long Zhengyu, was injured by those people from an American company, Harbo Group. I just pulled some strings in the middle, but I’ll save the details on the process. Shortly put, I made them fight. Those Harbo bastards suffered heavy losses and the others ended up bad as well. I’m sure you’re also crystal clear about what happened in Star City, aren’t you, Senior Duanmu?”</p><p>“I know some bits of it, but I have no idea what will unfold next,” replied Duanmu Lin with a smile.</p><p>“In any case, it should be the appearance of those werewolves on the video that made you come here, Senior Duanmu.” Tang Xiu went on. “I can tell you without reservation in that regard. In actuality, the one behind Harbo and Dandelion Groups is none other than the Stygian Club, and the backer behind the other company is the Pyramid. These two parties have already had some clashes prior to this and the conflict likely involved three parties, so I just added more fuel to the flame to drag these forces into a deeper conflict around the world.”</p><p>Duanmu Lin was shaken inwardly and asked in a deep voice, “What about China? I need to know what will happen here!”</p><p>“Nothing.” Tang Xiu shook his head. “What is unfolding here will come to an end.”</p><p>The response made Duanmu Lin immediately feel relaxed. But then he asked again curiously, “You want the Stygian Club to fight against the Pyramid. What for?”</p><p>“Don’t you think the fight between these foreign forces and weakening them will bring only good things for our country, Senior Duanmu?” asked Tang Xiu back. “Nothing wrong with it, is it not?”</p><p>“I can see neither the advantages nor disadvantages in regard to this issue. I can only see you pulling the strings in the back, Kid,” said Duanmu Lin with a faint smile. “You gotta have some purpose in mind. Mind to elaborate some more to satisfy my curiosity?”</p><p>Tang Xiu thought for a moment and then said, “Senior Duanmu, the Stygian Club has been running amuck with all kinds of evil deeds for so many years. You also know that they have committed countless incidents that incur hatred from anyone—at least those who have suffered from their persecution. The Pyramid is likely not a bit better than them, either, given all kinds of practitioners among them. The other thing I have in mind is about cultivation resources where competition between me and these forces will be inevitable. That’s why I won’t take the active role to strike them but pull the strings to create a dog-eat-dog arena for them to fight. It will be quite fun to get some benefits from it.”</p><p>Duanmu Lin narrowed his eyes and asked, “Tang Xiu, do you have any exact targets in the future?”</p><p>After hearing the question, Tang Xiu stood straight from the sofa. He cupped his fists toward Duanmu Lin and said, “Senior Duanmu, I can tell that living for 180 years more won’t be a problem for you given your strength. I can tell you that my goal is to become an immortal and ascend to the Immortal World, which is the ultimate pursuit for any cultivators like me. If… I mean, if some decades later I and the Tang Sect disciples have ascended to the Immortal World, I’d need your help to take care of my relatives and friends I leave on Earth.”</p><p>Duanmu Lin abruptly got up with disbelief on his face. “Ascending and becoming an immortal? Are you kidding me, Tang Xiu? Even if your cultivation speed is very fast, for you to ascend in just a few decades is simply impossible! Even if you can ascend to the Immortal World by yourself, it’s just impossible saying that you can take all the cultivators from your Tang Sect, no?”</p><p>“I can achieve that,” replied Tang Xiu in a deep voice.</p><p>Duanmu Lin shivered. He instantly clenched his fists and hurriedly asked, “Tang Xiu, I may not a cultivator, but I think I also have a bit of ability. Since you can take all Tang Sect disciples to the Immortal World, can you… take me there… as well?”</p><p>“Are you sure?” asked Tang Xiu with a strange expression.</p><p>“I’m sure. Absolutely.” Duanmu Lin firmly nodded.</p><p>“You’re the Special Abilities Bureau’s Director, which makes you an indispensable figure in the country. Can you really let go of whatever you have on Earth, like people and everything else? Also, you must at least reach the Spirit Formation Stage if you want to ascend to the Immortal World. Given your current strength, let alone a Spirit Formation Stage expert, I think you’re not even a match for a Golden Core expert, right?”</p><p>Duanmu Lin’s expression stiffened and a bitter expression covered his face immediately. Then, he nodded with a forced smile. “I can leave everything I have on Earth, be it the people or some other secular issues. After all, I’m already very old and, in a few decades, there are not many people and things worth my concern anymore. It is actually the requirement of cultivation level that baffles me.”</p><p>Tang Xiu smilingly nodded. “That’s why I suggest you’d better put that idea down. Just do your work well and enjoy your old age!”</p><p>“No! Something is missing.” Duanmu Lin abruptly spoke again. “I think there’s something incongruent from what you told me, Tang Xiu. As far as I know, there are many of your Tang Sect disciples who are still at the Foundation Establishment Stage. They must break through the Golden Core and Nascent Soul Stages first if they want to reach the Spirit Formation Stage from their current cultivation level. I believe your cultivation speed is very fast, but there’s no way theirs are as fast as yours. In case they can’t reach the Spirit Formation Stage, does that mean they won’t be able to follow you to the Immortal World?”</p><p>“That’s the main reason I’m scheming in the dark to make the Stygian and Pyramid fight, Senior Duanmu.” Tang Xiu said, “Another chief reason is that I want to steal their resources. Only with enormous resources as the backing can my people keep breaking through and eventually reaching the Spirit Formation Stage. Of course, those who fail to reach the Spirit Formation Stage by the time I ascend to the Immortal World will have to stay behind.”</p><p>Duanmu Lin’s eyes shone as Tang Xiu’s explanation made him see a light of hope again. He interjected hurriedly, “Can I also become a cultivator, Tang Xiu? I’ll do anything to become one even if I must start from scratch.”</p><p>“That’s not a problem, of course.” Tang Xiu nodded and went on, “But you have many years behind you and it will be difficult for you to reach the Spirit Formation Stage. Unless…”</p><p>“Unless what?” Duanmu Lin hurriedly pursued.</p><p>“Unless you can get yourself an enormous number of cultivation resources and completely use the piled-up resources in the process.” Tang Xiu explained, “However, you’ll also face the drawbacks due to that as it would make it nearly impossible for you to break through again.”</p><p>“It’s the legendary Immortal World!” Duanmu Lin gritted his teeth and said, “I really want to see it. This is something I never dared imagine before, but I believe that you won’t deceive me. Hence, I’ll still be satisfied even if the highest level I can breakthrough through is only up to the Spirit Formation Stage. Besides, I’d still be countless times stronger than the current me.”</p><p>“I can teach you a set of cultivation techniques, but you have to give me the assurance that only you will practice it and not pass it onto others,” said Tang Xiu.</p><p>“I give you my word on that,” replied Duanmu Lin categorically.</p><p>Tang Xiu slowly nodded. After sitting back on the sofa, he lit up a cigarette, took a few deep puffs and said, “Alright, we’ll discuss the details later and shift to what is happening now.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
