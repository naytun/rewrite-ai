He gave 10 to Darknorth Everblithe, leaving 22 for himself. Seeing, You Zhoung’s eager and thirsty eyes, he threw 2 to him as if it was nothing but trash. Afterward, he stuffed the remaining 20 elixirs.</p><p>Every Springtime Elixir was equal to having half a life more in the Immortal World as it could quickly recover one’s any injuries no matter how severe they were.</p><p>Both Darknorth Everblithe and Darknorth Immortal had taken a Springtime Elixir less than 2 days ago and now had recovered. Both parties had the same purpose, which was to catch the Firecloud Cicadas, so they formed a team and quickly rushed towards the star region infested by these creatures.</p><p>Blazing Flame Starfield.</p><p>The area of this region was not vast, but it was inundated by high temperature at all times. Tang Xiu’s group of five had to go through several battles before they arrived here. Each time, the five of them were able to decimate the enemies and snatch any cultivation resources carried by them. However, such robbing-purpose battles made Darknorth Everblithe and Darknorth Immortal bitterly smile again and again with a helpless look.</p><p>If… it wasn’t for the fact that Tang Xiu’s group of three were the ones who rescued them, they would have thrown their faces and left them long ago. After all, robbing was akin to a despicable action that would stain their faces with shame given their identity.</p><p>However, Tang Xiu himself was unconcerned. At first, robbing was just his idea at first while he didn’t intend to kill their targets, to begin with. Still, of the more than 10 groups of people they ran into, 5 ambushed them first, whereas the other 6 were also very fierce and ruthless in battle.</p><p>He was well aware that some of the Immortals who came to the Polychromatic Lucent Starfield were ruthless and cruel people. After all, their purpose of coming here was for resources, and they must be ready to fight and go all out for it.</p><p>“This should be enough, Master.” Gu Yan’er sorted out all the resources they had robbed while holding Tang Xiu’s hand, chuckling.</p><p>Tang Xiu shook his head and said, “It’s not enough. How can we miss this chance now that we run into the Aurelian Artificer Sect’s Master? Yan’er, let’s hunt the Firecloud Cicada first. We shall try to catch many of them and then sell it later.”</p><p>Gu Yan’er instantly understood Tang Xiu’s intentions and nodded. “I’m fine with whatever. Besides, the more dangers we must face on the road, the more cultivation resources we can get as well. That’s a good point. Anyway, we’ve been outside for some time, Master. The earlier we can get this done, the earlier we can go back too. After all, we have no powerhouse presiding over the situation over there, and I’m afraid that some accidents are bound to happen.”</p><p>“I know that. I’ve been worrying about it too,” Tang Xiu said.</p><p>They were conversing by transmitting their voices straight to their ears, so the other three other people were unable to hear it. Suddenly, Darknorth Immortal spoke, “Great Tang Immortal friend, I think we don’t need to hold back anymore since we have been robbing resources of many people on the way here. Let’s just get rid of anyone who comes here to hunt for Firecloud Cicada. Such spirit objects belong to anyone who has the ability to snatch them, to begin with.”</p><p>Tang Xiu, however, shook his head and replied out of his normal response, “Nah, we can’t snatch them.”</p><p>Darknorth Immortal was stunned and asked with a confused face, “Why? Didn’t we…”</p><p>Tang Xiu raised his hand to interrupt him and solemnly said, “The Immortals who can catch these Firecloud Cicadas are usually very powerful. The weakest among them are at least Golden Immortals. As far as I know, even some Perfected Golden Immortals would occasionally come here to hunt these creatures. That’s why we need to avoid such means temporarily so as to prevent bumping into some enemies we can’t chew on.”</p><p>Darknorth Immortal immediately understood and pondered for a moment, before he curiously asked, “Anyhow, I’ve been meaning to ask you something, Great Tang Immortal friend. Do you mind if I ask you something?”</p><p>“Okay, please do ask,” Tang Xiu replied.</p><p>“You’ve gotten enormous cultivation resources after the Clearwater Clan has been dealt with. Isn’t it already enough? Are you in any trouble or something? Given how urgent and eager you are in getting cultivation resources.”</p><p>Tang Xiu forced a wry smile and said, “Ah, you’ve seen through me. That’s right, we do have some problems regarding resources. Further, I’ve been thinking about another idea which I’d like to talk to you about after we’ve hunted the Firecloud Cicada. But now that you’ve mentioned it, then I will speak about it now.”</p><p>“I’m all ears.” Darknorth Immortal’s expression shifted and he immediately nodded.</p><p>“My clan can be said as one of those superpowers in the entire Immortal World. However, the clan is too big and we have too many outstanding juniors; I’m one of them,” Tang Xiu began narrating. “I was sent to some remote places to gain experience and broaden my knowledge. I brought a lot of subordinates with me and they’re now kind of very impoverished and need a massive number of cultivation resources. That’s why I’d like to order a number of artifacts and immortal weapons from your Aurelian Artificer Sect.”</p><p>Darknorth’s doubts were finally assuaged. He now fully understood why such an expert like Gu Yan’er, who was just a hair away from breaking through to the Perfected Golden Immortal Stage, didn’t even bother to think about her status and resorted to robbery.</p><p>“What kind of artifacts and how many of them do you need?”</p><p>Having learned some facts of Tang Xiu’s identity, Darknorth Immortal had the intention to stay on good terms with him. After all, being able to make friends with juniors of super-large clans in the Immortal World would be greatly beneficial for his marginal Aurelian Artificer Sect.</p><p>Tang Xiu pondered for a moment and then said, “At least 240,000 immortal swords. The quality doesn’t need to be too high, so low-grade immortal swords should suffice. I also need 240,000 sets of battle armors, the stronger its defensive features, the better, and I’ll provide the blueprints for you. Additionally, if your sect has any outstanding divine weapons or artifacts, such as concealed weapons and the likes, I also want a batch of them. The more the better.”</p><p><em>240,000 sets of these items?!</em></p><p>Darknorth Immortal’s mouth twitched and he could only force a smile inwardly. He felt a deep sense of helplessness after hearing such a huge number.</p><p>His Aurelian Artificer Sect was indeed a fairly large faction in this Immortal Domain, but refining so many immortal swords and battle armors in a short time would prove to be very strenuous and difficult even for them.</p><p>“10 years. I’ll need at least 10 years to achieve it.” Darknorth Immortal hesitated for a long while before he gritted his teeth and gave his reply.</p><p>“No. A year.” Tang Xiu shook his head and said, “I can only give you one year at most. But you can rest assured that I’ll pay you with Immortal Stones and Crystals for these weapons. However, I can only stay in your Immortal Domain for a year more as I’m going to take them away to some other domains.”</p><p>Darknorth Immortal shook his head. “That’s impossible. My sect may have tens of thousands of disciples, but even if we are to mobilize them, I don’t think it’s possible to refine so many immortal swords and battle armors within a year.”</p><p>“Well, I can give you the Immortal Stones and Crystals as advance payment,” Tang Xiu said. “You can use them to attract refiner experts and grandmasters with such wealth, no? Besides, I’m sure you should have a deep relationship with other Artificers and refining experts. Further, I’ll pay you twice the market price. How about it?”</p><p>Darknorth Immortal shifted to Darknorth Everblithe and both men communicated through voice transmission for more than 10 minutes. Finally, the former replied, “The delivery is guaranteed to be within a year at the normal price. You’ve saved my ancestor’s life and mine, so you’re the benefactor of my sect. We’ll make sure to complete the job as promised even if we must incur a loss.”</p><p>After saying that, he cast a technique to pass the news back to the Aurelian Artificer Sect so the people there were prepared in advance.</p><p>A few days later, the group of five finally found the traces of Firecloud Cicadas near a gushing crater.</p><p>Darknorth Everblithe observed it for a while and then said with a wry smile, “You know, I’ve been here several times already and I know some of the habits of Firecloud Cicadas. These creatures will flock to this place, attracted by this volcanic eruption. However, the first thing they will do is definitely enter the magma in the volcano the moment they arrive here. So, if we still want to hunt them, we must wait until this volcano finishes erupting since those Firecloud Cicadas will automatically come out from the inside.”</p><p>Tang Xiu looked at the gushing volcano and shook his head with a smile. “Why should we resort to such troublesome procedures? Just look at me.”</p><p>Having said that, he stopped Gu Yan’er from following him and flew alone over the gushing lava. Taking out a black jade bottle from the interspatial ring, he unplugged the cork and poured it down to the magma below.</p><p>“Aphid Liquid…”</p><p>Tang Xiu found it in the interspatial ring of someone in a group of Immortals he robbed. This Aphid Liquid had a huge attraction to Firecloud Cicadas and naturally greatly benefited it. Once those Firecloud Cicadas smelled this Aphid Liquid, they would definitely come out of the magma.</p><p>Thousands of years ago, Tang Xiu easily hunted these creatures thanks to his formidable strength. But later on, he obtained this Aphid Fluid after slaughtering several Demons. Unfortunately, he hadn’t had the chance to put it to use and just put it away.</p><p>As expected, a few minutes later, he clearly saw the figure of a Firecloud Cicada. The fist-sized insect had a full scarlet body and its eyes glowed with colorfully. Two minutes after the first Firecloud Cicada appeared, Tang Xu saw over 30 of them coming out.</p><p>“Help me capture all these Firecloud Cicadas, Star Devourer Insect. I’ll give you some elixirs that will increase your power if you can catch all of them.” Tang Xiu sent a voice transmission to Star Devourer Insect.</p><p>“It’s a deal!”</p><p>As Star Devourer Insect sent a telepathic reply, Tang Xiu immediately released it and watched its body suddenly begin to enlarge dramatically into a kilometer in size.</p><p><em>Buzz…</em></p><p>A terrifying devouring force firmly locked more than 30 Firecloud Cicadas. 10 seconds after, all of them shrieked before they were sucked into Star Devourer Insect’s mouth. Tang Xiu quickly threw 36 jade bottles which were directly swallowed into Star Devourer Insect’s mouth and stuffed each of the 36 cicadas into each jade bottle.</p><p>Star Devourer Insect vomited all the jade bottles, turned into a streak of light, and then disappeared after entering Tang Xiu’s body.</p><p>Tang Xiu happily put the 36 jade bottles into his interspatial ring and flew back to the group. But the three fellas, Darknorth Everblithe, Darknorth Immortal, and You Zhong were all dumbfounded and tongue-tied as though they were petrified. Then, he chuckled and spoke, “Hey, why are you guys looking at me like that? Hunting and catching Firecloud Cicadas are really this simple, you know!”</p><p>Simple?!</p><p>The three guys’ mouths twitched and threw their faces to the side at the same time.</p><p>They really wished to smack Tang Xiu. “So easy and this simple”. It was something extremely difficult for them.</p><p>“Well, how many Firecloud Cicadas for all those weapons I’ve ordered from you, Darknorth Immortal?” Tang Xiu chuckled and said, “You also know that this thing fetches quite the fortune, right?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
