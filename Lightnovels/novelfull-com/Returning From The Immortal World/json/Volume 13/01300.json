Sword lights were seen flashing all over the sky while countless immortals and cultivators came in and out of the city gate. The pair looked at each other and quickly landed on the ground outside the city gate. On the way here, however, he asked You Zhong to leave since Tang Xiu wasn’t yet able to trust him. After all, he was someone from the Immortal World.</p><p>The pair slowly strolled along the wide street full of pedestrians. A reminiscing look filled their eyes as they looked around at the scene of the classical city before their eyes. Compared to Earth, however, they felt more at home here. After all, it was a place they had lived for a very long time.</p><p>“It’s the Celestial Vine Pavilion.” Tang Xiu pointed to a 100-meter-tall tower-like building and said with a smile, “Of all the merchant companies in the entire Immortal World, this Celestial Vine Pavilion surely can be counted in the rank of the biggest few. We can lower the price of the Auric Profusion Source to them, but I’m sure that we can still fetch 200,000 Immortal Crystal for each.”</p><p>“We’re indeed in urgent need of a lot of Immortal Stones and Crystals now.” Gu Yan’er nodded. “Anyhow, how many do you plan to sell, Master?”</p><p>Tang Xiu ruminated for a moment and then answered, “We’ll sell 4 and then bring the rest for our own people! After all, it’s a treasure most needed by the people of our Empire.”</p><p>Gu Yan’er thought for a while and said, “How many Immortal Stores or Immortal Crystals do you need for using the spatial teleportation array, exactly?”</p><p>“To be honest, I don’t really know the specific fare since no one dared to charge me given my identity in the past.” Tang Xiu shook his head and said, “But still, we got too many people, so we’ll need quite a lot of Immortal Stones or Crystals.”</p><p>“Then selling four makes sense!” Gu Yan’er said, “I hope this Celestial Vine Pavilion is as credible as it used to be, else we’ll tear this branch.”</p><p>“Well, I’m looking forward to what they’re gonna do, regardless.” Tang Xiu chuckled. “After all, the one who’s holding the fort in such a remote place in the Immortal World is at least a Golden Immortal. There’s even a high chance that the person will only be a Profound Immortal at most.”</p><p>A short while after, Tang Xiu and Gu Yan’er appeared in the Celestial Vine Pavilion’s office. A beautiful saleslady in white robes welcomed them, then Tang Xiu directly said, “Call your supervisor here. Tell him that I have a big deal for him.”</p><p>The saleslady froze and carefully observed Tang Xiu and Gu Yan’er. Sensing that this pair was rather extraordinary, she respectfully said, “Please follow me. I’ll take you to the VIP room on the sixth floor. I’ll notify the Pavilion Manager immediately.”</p><p>“Lead the way, then!”</p><p>Tang Xiu and Gu Yan’er followed her to the sixth floor and entered a large VIP room. After taking a seat on the cushion, fragrant tea was served and a middle-aged man that gave off a scholarly aura entered the VIP room with a smiling face. As his gaze glanced from Tang Xiu and Gu Yan’er, he immediately said with a smile, “Welcome, two Fellow Immortals. I heard both of you have a big deal to offer to our office, yes? Ah, I forgot to introduce myself. This one is Manager of Wolfish Immortal Domain’s Celestial Vine Pavilion, Clip Marchland.”</p><p>Tang Xiu watched the beautiful saleslady leave and quietly closed the door first. Afterward, he immediately raised his hand, took a jade bottle out of his interspatial ring, and lightly smiled. “This is a fully developed Auric Profusion Source, please state a reasonable price for it. If the price is acceptable, then we can strike a deal without bargaining back and forth. I’ll directly leave to sell it elsewhere if I can’t accept the price.”</p><p>The Auric Profusion Source?</p><p>Clip Marchland was stunned for a moment, then he turned surprised. He opened the jade bottle, observed the contents, and then finally nodded. “This is indeed a developed Auric Profusion Source—a very valuable treasure I’m sure will create intense fights among Immortals once appears on the market. Since Fellow Immortal comes visiting and won’t bargain, then allow me to give you a real price for it. How about 240,000 Immortal Crystals? If Fellow Immortal is willing to sell it, this one will immediately pay you with Immortal Crystals. Fellow Immortal is free to sell it elsewhere if my offer is not acceptable.”</p><p>240,000 Immortal Crystals?</p><p>The price was still in the acceptable range to Tang Xiu, so he nodded. “It’s a fair price, so I accept. May I know whether your Celestial Vine Pavilion’s branch here has more appetite?”</p><p>Clip Marchland was surprised. “Does Fellow Immortal have more Auric Profusion Sources, by chance?”</p><p>“Yeah,” Tang Xiu said.</p><p>Clip Marchland re-observed Tang Xiu and Gu Yan’er carefully once again. Then, he seriously said, “If Fellow Immortal has more than 10 Auric Profusion Sources, striking a deal now is not possible for this branch office, and I’d like to ask 10 days of time more. We can buy however many Auric Profusion Sources you may have 10 days later.”</p><p>Tang Xiu’s eyes glinted and he said in a deep voice, “We only have four, and it already took us quite an effort and hardship. However, I’d like to add a little more to the price. 4 Auric Profusion Sources for a total of 1 million Immortal Crystals. We’ll have a deal if you can accept it.”</p><p>Clip Marchland gave it a thought and then nodded. “Deal.”</p><p>Tang Xiu gave the remaining three Auric Profusion Sources to him. After waiting for half an hour, the latter gave him an interspatial ring and said, “This ring has 1 million Immortal Crystals. If Fellow Immortal has Auric Profusion Sources or some other good objects later, please think of us first. The Celestial Vine Pavilion always does our business with absolutely fair prices.”</p><p>“Please rest assured about that. I have had countless transactions with your Celestial Vine Pavilion and the deals have always been great.” Tang Xiu smiled and said, “Anyhow, since we’ve concluded the business, then we’re taking our leave. I’ll naturally come to find you if other business opportunities appear in the future.”</p><p>“Alright. Please allow me to send you off.”</p><p>Clip Marchland sent Tang Xiu and Gu Yan’er out of the office. His eyes gleamed as he watched them disappear into the distance amid the constant stream of people. At this moment, a middle-aged woman silently appeared beside him, and Clip Marchland asked, “Did you see their strength?”</p><p>“That young man gives off an aura that he has just crossed a tribulation and just become an Immortal for some time. I really can’t grasp the cultivation of the woman next to him, but I sense that her cultivation should be much higher than mine.”</p><p>“People who can sell 4 Auric Profusion Sources at once are likely not ordinary figures.” Clip Marchland nodded and said, “But buying 4 of these items and earning hundreds of thousands of Immortal Crystals is already a great thing for us.”</p><p>“Then, shall we send some people to investigate their identity?” the middle-aged woman asked.</p><p>“It’s all right!” Clip Marchland shook his head. “We don’t need to investigate such a big client. Doing it will only create troubles and make them misunderstand our Celestial Vine Pavilion. By the way, buy one of the Auric Profusion Source for 250,000 Immortal Crystals for yourself! Your daughter probably needs it now.”</p><p>The middle-aged woman looked grateful and gently nodded. “Then I’ll bring these Immortal Crystals to the vault later.”</p><p>****</p><p>In the city, Tang Xiu and Gu Yan’er strolled around and bought a lot of cultivation resources since they now had a lot of funds, after all. 1 million Immortal Crystals were equal to 1 billion Immortal Stones—an amount many ordinary immortals couldn’t possibly have even after cultivating for millenniums. The pair quickly spent 200,000 Immortal Crystals after some purchases and then left happily.</p><p>However, their extravagant spending inevitably attracted some people’s attention. Tens of people stealthily stalked them as they left the city.</p><p>“What shall we do about these people, Master?” Gu Yan’er whispered with a grin on her face while holding Tang Xiu’s arm.</p><p>“Let’s just shake them off.” Tang Xiu lightly smiled and said, “Such rabbles are always easy to figure out. Besides, they are also some poor bunch and not worth wasting our energy.”</p><p>Smiling faintly in response, Gu Yan’er rose to the air with Tang Xiu and shook off the tens of these stalkers and vanished from their sights in just several breaths.</p><p>This Immortal Domain also had a very large area with an extremely vast landmass. According to the coordinates received from Darknorth Immortal, Tang Xiu easily found the Aurelian Artificer Sect located roughly 500,000 km in the depth of a grand mountain.</p><p>Above the clouds…</p><p>Tang Xiu and Gu Yan’er looked down at a mountain below. He then nodded and spoke, “I’ve been to this place before, but it’s been too long and my memory about it is a bit blurred. But I still remember that this sect was previously in a mountain range with no spirit mist around it. This sect seems to have spent quite a lot to hire an Array Grandmaster to arrange such a huge array of spirit gathering after going through some developments.”</p><p>Gu Yan’er smiled and said, “Some people found us, Master.”</p><p>Tang Xiu saw several burly figures flying up into the sky as he smiled and said aloud, “This Great Tang Heavenly Emperor comes to the appointment. Please show me the way to see your Sect Master, Darknorth Immortal.”</p><p>The leader, a red-haired stalwart man, observed Tang Xiu and Gu Yan’er for a short while before he respectfully cupped his fists and said, “We have been given the order to wait for Great Tang Fellow Immortal from Master. Please follow me.”</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>A moment after, the red-haired man took Tang Xiu and Gu Yan’er to the Aurelian Artificer Sect. Refining furnaces could be seen everywhere as they entered the interior, with sect disciples bustling about them in almost every corner.</p><p>“Hahaha…”</p><p>A loud laughter came from afar as Darknorth Immortal came in front of Tang Xiu and Gu Yan’er along with two other high-ranked members of his sect.</p><p>“Great Tang Immortal friend is really punctual. You even come here before the half-year deadline.”</p><p>“Well, we got enough Immortal Crystals, so we naturally won’t waste any more time,” Tang Xiu replied with a smile. “Anyway, how is it going with the project I’ve entrusted to you, Darknorth Immortal?”</p><p>“No worries about that!” Darknorth Immortal grinned and said, “We’ve invited all the refiner experts in the hundreds of thousands of kilometers area neighboring us, and all of them have been working days and nights for it. We estimate that we’ll be able to complete your order in at most 10 months. However, we have invited too many expert artificers and the rate of our spending is very fast. May I…”</p><p>Tang Xiu flipped his hand and took out an interspatial ring with 200,000 Immortal Crystals that had been prepared in advance. He then handed it to Darknorth Immortal and said, “Check this out. If the number is right, we’re going to take our leave since we need to go somewhere else.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
