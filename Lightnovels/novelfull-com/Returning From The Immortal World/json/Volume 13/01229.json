It was an upscale, first-class resort in the entire capital popular among officials, dignitaries, as well as the young ladies and scions of affluent families due to its rich recreation and entertainment.</p><p>Su Xiaoguang was reeking with alcohol when he entered the warm steaming hot spring pool and was already drunk when he leaned onto the warm hot spring pond. A fine Cuban cigar was clamped at the end of his lips while Chen Haoren, who sat next to him, had indistinct fierceness and cruelty flashing in his eyes from time to time.</p><p>“You guys tell me. How much wealth does the Magnificent Tang Corp have? How much wealth can we share if we obtain this company?” Suddenly, Chen Haoren asked.</p><p>The other five were stunned and immediately thought about it. Afterward, each and every one of them wore a shocked expression.</p><p>Su Xiaoguang clenched his fists and said aloud, “I heard that the auction held by Magnificent Tang Corporation amassed a colossal amount of money. It’s said that they earned hundreds of billions, and maybe over 1 trillion yuan. If we can get this company and then share only a fraction of it, we all will definitely become super-rich. We can even enter the front line of the rich, like their spokesman. All in all, we can do anything we want in the future.”</p><p>Chen Haoran’s mouth curved and an evil grin appeared on his face when he meaningfully said, “House Tang is no longer glorious. Although I have no idea what happened to them, the members of this family have resigned from their posts in the government and left their business mogul status. They are like hidden rats with no trace to be found now. What does this mean, then? I think it shows that the Tangs must have encountered big troubles or something, which forced them to give up everything, be it their positions, wealth, and status. Their wealth still remains now, but it’s obvious that it will become free meals ready to be devoured by other powers.”</p><p>“Haoran, I’ll follow along if you dare to take the action on this one,” blurted Su Xiaoguang in a deep voice.</p><p>Chen Haoran smiled in response. Just as he shifted to the rest, he noticed that the owner of Golden Coast Hot Spring Resort, Zheng Dong, a man who also had considerable standing in the capital, was coming over half-running with four black-suited men as if something had happened.</p><p>As Zheng Dong came to the hot spring pool, he glanced over at the everyone with a complicated expression. As his eyes finally landed on Su Xiaoguang’s face, his expression looked solemn. “Su Xiaoguang, I give you 10 minutes to leave this resort. You’re not welcome anymore starting from today.”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>Su Xiaoguang was dumbfounded and stared blankly at Zheng Dong as though the man was a complete stranger to him. Prior to this, Zheng Dong had always acted humbly and so enthusiastic like his own lackey. Why did he turn his face and refuse him now? When did he ever annoy or offend him?</p><p>Chen Haoran furrowed his brows and asked in a heavy tone, “What do you mean by that, Boss Zheng? We’re all brothers, yet you want to drive Su Xiaoguang away so blatantly. Are you also driving us away?”</p><p>Zheng Dong hesitated for a moment. His expression changed and he squeezed out a forced smile and helplessly said, “Young Master Chen, it’s not like I want to drive Su Xiaoguang away. It’s because I’m scared that I have to drive him away. He has courted huge trouble to himself. I will probably be implicated if I let him stay here. Please hear my advice. Hurry up and announce that you have no relationship with him, else it will be difficult for you to avoid the imminent calamity coming for you!”</p><p>His statement made Chen Haoran even more confused. “What do you mean?”</p><p>“Haven’t you heard about the latest news, Young Master Chen?” asked Zheng Dong. “Do you know that Su Xiaoguang has pissed off someone he can’t afford to provoke? He has annoyed that House Tang’s Young Master! People always say that a lean camel is still bigger than a horse. House Tang is the current super-powerful and was the one who completely annihilated House Yao, another very powerful family, then. He just courted his own death by provoking them! Alas, I won’t say anything more about this Su brat. Just scram from my place and don’t bring calamity to me. I’m just a small-time businessman, I can’t afford to get involved with you.”</p><p>Su Xiaoguang jumped out of the hot spring naked. But being drunk after drinking too much last night, his wet feet didn’t stand properly on the floor and he fell straight with his head on the floor. He shrieked due to the pain, though it helped him sober up from his drunkenness.</p><p>“What the hell did you just say, surnamed Zheng? Do you dare repeat it to this Daddy, huh?” Su Xiaoguang struggled to get up and yelled angrily.</p><p>Zheng Dong narrowed his eyes in response and then replied without being salty, “Don’t blame me from acting indifferent towards you, Young Master Su. But the man you’ve provoked is very terrifying. Not to mention me, even your family just suffered a heavy blow this time. I dare say that your family won’t even be able to stand up again for the next 10 years. You… best take care of yourself!”</p><p>“What the hell do you mean by that, Zheng?!” Su Xiaoguang got up with difficulty and shouted, “Spit out everything!”</p><p>Zheng Dong glanced at the cell phones on the poolside table. Then, he lightly replied, “I’m really curious. Sensational news has literally exploded outside, yet you are still acting mighty and ignorant like this. Did no one call you at least once? Does Patriarch Su really dote you to this extent, he even left you out when your family is going to collapse?”</p><p>My family is going to collapse?</p><p>Su Xiaoguang’s heart pounded. He may be a silk pant, but he was still quite smart. He could faintly tell that some major event had happened given how Zheng Dong acted and the words he said after he arrived.</p><p>Immediately after, he rushed to the poolside table and grabbed his cell phone. After checking it, he found that his cell phone was out of battery and had been automatically shut down. He quickly grabbed Chen Haoran’s mobile phone and dialed his father’s number.</p><p>“Who’s this?” an angry voice asked from the phone.</p><p>“It’s me, Dad. Has something happened in our family?” asked Su Xiaoguang quickly.</p><p>Ten seconds passed, but no sounds nor reply came from the phone. Just as uneasiness grew in Su Xiaoguang’s heart, it wasn’t a voice nor sound that came out, but a roar. “YOU DAMN BEAST! SWINE! You only f*cking know how to make troubles all day long. Get the hell back here now! You must get back home in half an hour!”</p><p>Beast? Swine? Dad actually swears and calls me… a beast?</p><p>Disbelief was all over Su Xiaoguang’s face and his heart fell to the bottom. He was now completely sure that something, a big accident, really happened at home.</p><p>Chen Haoran frowned deeper. He came to Su Xiaoguang’s side and received his phone back from him. Then, he asked, “What happened?”</p><p>Su Xiaoguang turned difficultly. His lips squirmed a few times when he saw Chen Haoran, but nothing came out of it. The next moment, he staggered to the pond, put on his clothes, and then walked towards the outside staggeringly.</p><p>He must go home. He needed to find out what was happening in the Su Family residence.</p><p>Chen Haoran fiddled with his cell phone before he looked at Zheng Dong and asked, “Boss Zheng, your actions were eye-catching and I see you in a new light now. But I’m sure there’s a reason given your personality. Just tell me what exactly happened to the Su Family.”</p><p>“Young Master Chen, I know that you are friends with Su Xiaoguang.” Zheng Dong forced a smile. “But please heed my advice and draw a line with him right away and never have any relationship with him anymore. Though if my guess is correct, the chance for you two to meet in the future will be next to nil.”</p><p>“Tell me more.” Chen Haoran looked cold.</p><p>“I have no idea how Su Xiaoguang provoked House Tang. But in the end, Tang Xiu and a large number of ability users from the Special Abilities Bureau directly besieged the Su Family’s residence and charged them for treason. At least tens of the family guards were killed and then… that Tang Xiu from House Tang…”</p><p>Zheng Dong told the whole story he knew and finally sighed. “As of now, all the affluent families in the capital have learned about this incident. The news has spread out, not only limited in the capital, but also has passed to all the forces and powerful families in entire China. Although a large number of House Tang’s members are missing, this family is now much more fearsome than ever with such a large mountain like the Special Abilities Bureau behind them.”</p><p>Chen Haoran trembled and nearly fell to the floor. His complexion turned ghastly pale instantly and fear and dread were visible in his eyes.</p><p>It was a big trouble.</p><p>He knew exactly the cause of the incident. No one knew better than him what Su Xiaoguang did to offend Tang Xiu, which ultimately led to such a disaster to the Su Family. If… it wasn’t Su Xiaoguang who intervened him at the Monarch Club back then, it would have been him who offended Tang Xiu.</p><p>NO! It was very likely that he had offended Tang Xiu.</p><p>The moment Chen Haoran realized it, he suddenly felt a chill as though he was falling into an ice hole. He quickly put on his clothes, grabbed his things, and then ran outside.</p><p>Going home! He needed to go home right away and quickly tell the elders of his family to try to find a remedy to resolve this issue. Else, even if the Chens were slightly stronger than the Sus, fighting against the fearsome people from the Special Abilities Bureau was futile and only courting their own deaths!</p><p>****</p><p>At the Chen Family residence.</p><p>Chen Shuo sat in front of Family Head, Chen Xintao, who wore a wry smile on his normally dignified face. Then, he said, “Dad, this is just simply a gangster play. How could the Sus possibly commit treason? Yet, such a charge was just casually thrown at them. This is simply despicable.”</p><p>“Heh, the Sus only have themselves to blame on this one.” Chen Xintao sneered. “Having such wastrel as descendant who only knows to stir up troubles and finally causes a disaster to the family. House Tang… Hehe. I can’t even figure out what happened to them until now, yet someone has started to provoke this family. This is just giving a chance to House Tang to kill a chicken to warn the monkeys!”</p><p>“My thoughts exactly.” Chen Shuo nodded. “It’s just that I never thought that the Tangs would actually kill a chicken with a huge cleaver. Such a method of a deliberate show of strength is really effective to warn others. There’s no need for Tang Yunpeng to move at all.”</p><p>“House Tang only leaves Tang Yunpeng alone now. It’s very likely that he has very powerful cards in his hands.” Chen Xintao said, “He didn’t need to move, but Tang Xiu still easily brought out such a great mountain and directly crushed the Su Family. That’s really a great and amazing feat!”</p><p>Chen Suo nodded and was about to speak. Suddenly, he recalled something and his face slightly changed. He then hurriedly said, “Father, as far as I know, Haoran often hangs out with Su Xiaoguang, that Su Family’s brat. Do you think that with Su Xiaoguang offending Tang Xiu and House Tang, then Haoran…”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
