In the next moment, he appeared in the General Manager’s office on the 66th floor.</p><p>Behind the desk, the flowing long-haired Gao Beilei in a white suit was quietly reading some documents. She immediately looked to see Tang Xiu when she realized that there was someone in front of her.</p><p>“Boss!” Gao Beilei hurriedly got up and called out with a respectful expression.</p><p>“Are you busy now?” Tang Xiu lightly smiled. “How about accompanying me on a tour of the industrial park?”</p><p>“I haven’t noticed anyone in advance, so all the plants are now operating according to the usual working procedures. Do you have a certain plant you would like to visit, perhaps?” Gao Beilei asked.</p><p>“I want to visit the brewery, visiting the rest will be optional,” Tang Xiu said lightly.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Gao Beilei nodded and called the secretary of the office through the PABX phone. As the good-looking female secretary wearing high heels and a red suit knocked on the door and entered, she looked at Tang Xiu and was surprised. Her desk was right outside the office, but she had never seen this stranger enter the General Manager Office previously.</p><p>Suddenly, she felt that Tang Xiu was familiar, and after recollecting her memory, she suddenly trembled and asked with incredulity on her face, “Aren’t you… Boss… Tang?”</p><p>“Little Zhou, this is our company’s Boss. Call Production Manager Liu, Deputy General Manager Chen, as well as the rest of the factory directors. Tell them to hurry up, there’s something important here to…”</p><p>Tang Xiu raised his hand to interrupt her and lightly said, “I don’t want to create a big parade during my visit. Just accompany me to tour around the place. Let the factory director accompany later when I visit each of the projects. By the way, what is Scarface Qiang’s position now? I haven’t seen him for years, so I miss him a bit.”</p><p>“Huh? Scarface Qiang?” Gao Beilei was confused and curiously asked, “Who’s this Scarface Qiang, Boss?”</p><p>Tang Xiu blanked for a moment and then suddenly burst out laughing. “Ah, hahaha. It’s the nickname of a familiar man. His name is Dai Qiang, and he was the director of the winery when the plant was in Star City.”</p><p>Gao Beilei immediately understood, but she hesitated for a while and then said in a low voice, “Dai Qiang resigned half a year ago, Boss. I have no idea where he lives right now.”</p><p>“Come again?” Tang Xiu suddenly looked gloomy. “What’s going on here?”</p><p>Gao Beilei inwardly shouted that this would be a mess. She was not Tang Xiu’s direct subordinate at the time. Although she had inquired many things about him, she never heard that Tang Xiu had a good relationship with Dai Qiang. In the event half a year ago, Deputy General Manager Chen had become the No.2 figure in the Magnificent Tang Corporation, so it was natural that she favored this man a bit and eventually forced Dai Qiang to resign out of anger.</p><p>“Boss, about this…”</p><p>Tang Xiu fell into silence for a while. He went to the corner and took a seat on the sofa there. After taking out a cigarette and liting it up, he took a deep puff before taking out his cell phone, finding Dai Qiang’s cell number, and then dialing it directly.</p><p>After some time, his call was picked up and the voice of a drunk man came out from the phone. “Who is this? Calling in the middle of the night and disturbing my dreams? Do you not know how immoral this is?”</p><p>After saying that, the call was hung up.</p><p><em>Is it in the middle of the night already?</em></p><p>Tang Xiu shifted his vision and looked out the window. Although it was a bit cold, the time was exactly at 2:30 in the afternoon. He took a deep breath and then dialed back again. Just as Dai Qiang was about to pull a tantrum again, he spoke in a deep voice, “It’s me, Tang Xiu, Scarface Qiang!”</p><p>Half a minute passed by, but Dai Qiang’s voice didn’t come out of the phone. However, Tang Xiu could clearly hear his breathing become rushed from the phone.</p><p>“Where are you now?” Tang Xiu asked.</p><p>“Bo… Boss… I-I’m in Star City.” Dai Qiang’s bitter voice came from the phone.</p><p>“Get to the Star City Airport right away, I’ll send a special plane to pick you up.” Tang Xiu ordered. “Get your ass here no matter what happened before. Be mentally prepared to be punished by me if you are the one who caused the problem, but if it was not your fault… Hmph…”</p><p>“Okay, okay, okay. I’ll head there right away!”</p><p>Dai Qiang immediately replied from the other end of the phone, and he sounded excited.</p><p>Tang Xiu hung up and tilted up his head to stare at Gao Beilei. Then, he waved to the secretary as a hint to make her leave. Afterward, he pointed to the sofa in front of him, watched Gao Beilei take a seat, and then calmly said, “I met Scarface Dai Qiang by chance in some mountainous area when I went on an adventure. It was kind of a funny scene when I met him, though. The first time I met him, he was just a brigand who robbed anyone passing the road, whereas I was a passerby he robbed at that time.”</p><p>Gao Beilei didn’t utter any word, but she was perfectly aware that some people in the company were about to get sacked.</p><p>Tang Xiu went on, “When I first found the Magnificent Tang Corporation, God’s Nectar was not yet included in the list of the manufactured products. I already had the recipe to brew it at the time, but no one was available to manufacture it. I brought Dai Qiang from that mountainous area to Star City myself, and his contribution to the success of God’s Nectar brewing was undeniable. The reason I called him Scarface Qiang instead of Dai Qiang was because of his good character. At least I know that he’d never resort to schemes and intrigues, and he would never become greedy when he saw money before his eyes.”</p><p>Seeing that Tang Xiu stopped speaking at this point, Gao Beilei interjected. “I understand what you mean, Boss. I’ll report to you the course of the matter in an objective and fair manner. However, I dare not say that everything I say is 100% true.”</p><p>“Elaborate. I’m all ears,” Tang Xiu said.</p><p>“Six months ago, the winery’s warehouse lost a batch of wine, a total of 200 boxes of God’s Nectar.” Gao Beilie started narrating. “Dai Qiang was the director of the winery at the time. That night, apart from the company security guards on duty, he was the only one who entered the warehouse, and I’ve seen the footage from the beginning to end when he went there three times.</p><p>“The person responsible for investigating the cause of the theft at the time was Chen Liwei, our company’s Deputy General Manager. Chen Liwei joined the company two months earlier than me and he was already considered as a senior executive in the company then. After the investigation, he found that two members of the security team were responsible for the theft and accused Dai Qiang of stealing 200 boxes of God’s Nectar.</p><p>“Afterward, Deputy General Manager Chen took a team to Dai Qiang’s residence. At that time, Dai Qiang adamantly refused to admit to the theft and was even willing to let the team search his home to prove his innocence. At the end of the day, the security team members found 10 boxes of God’s Nectar in his house, but Dai Qiang vehemently said that someone must have put them there to frame him.</p><p>“However, the witnesses and physical evidence were all there against Dai Qiang’s testimony. He finally chose to retain his shares in the winery and then resigned as the director of the plant and left the company. I originally wanted to report this matter to President Kang and let her make a decision. I tried to contact her many times through various means but to no avail. Therefore, I could only put this matter on hold, and then I forgot to report it since I was too busy.”</p><p>Tang Xiu calmly listened to Gao Beilei’s explanation and understood inwardly that the Magnificent Tang Corporation had very likely not been quite peaceful in the past few years. He could tell there must be fierce struggles among the top management of the company, while Dai Qiang may have affected or even disturbed some people’s source of income. Eventually, he got squeezed out of the company by some despicable shenanigans.</p><p>“Struggles are inevitable whenever people gather together, huh!” Tang Xiu couldn’t help but sigh. But his expression immediately turned cold as he indifferently said, “Tell Chen Liwei to come to see me now! It’s very likely I’ll figure out the issue the moment I see him.”</p><p>Gao Beilei spaced out for a moment before a contemptuous look flashed across her eyes. She actually had a faint guess that Chen Liwei was a source of problems. However, this man was very shrewd and she had never caught him red-handed. Further, Chen Liwei himself was a very capable man. Thanks to him and his assistance with her works all these years, she wouldn’t have been able to bring the Magnificent Tang Corporation to such a height today.</p><p>Due to this reason, Gao Beilei believed that Tang Xiu wouldn’t be able to get anything from this man.</p><p>After a while, a thin, tall, and fair-skinned middle-aged man knocked on the door of the General Manager Office. He slightly dazed when he saw Tang Xiu sitting on the sofa before he immediately recognized Tang Xiu’s identity. With a pleasantly surprised face, he paced forward and said, “Hello, Boss. I’m Chen Liwei. It’s my first time seeing you after working for three years for the Magnificent Tang Corporation.”</p><p>Tang Xiu observed Chen Liwei for some time. He could keenly sense this man’s evil tendencies, which showed that he had killed quite a lot of people before. Further, aside from such sinister aura, there was also a particular scent after having sex, which meant that Chen Liwei just had sex within the last two hours.</p><p>“You’re Chen Liwei? Come and sit cross-legged in front of me,” Tang Xiu waved and said with a smile on his handsome face.</p><p>Chen Liwei looked black and then hesitated. “You asked me to… sit cross-legged on the floor, Boss?”</p><p>“What’s wrong? You refuse?” Tang Xiu asked with a smile.</p><p>Chen Liwei shook his head quickly and said, “No, no, no. I’ll do as you told, Boss. I’m just a bit puzzled as to why…”</p><p>“I’m sure you know about my other identity. I’m a Chinese medicine practitioner, so I naturally care about the health of my employees.” Tang Xiu interrupted him while keeping the smile on his face. “I just saw you walking, and you seem to have overworked yourself from your steps. That’s why I want to give you a diagnosis of whether there’s something wrong with your body.”</p><p>Chen Liwei immediately looked relieved upon hearing this. He walked to Tang Xiu’s front and then sat cross-legged. Then, he smilingly said, “I’m very touched with Boss’s compassion for his subordinates. I’ll definitely work harder in the future to make our Magnificent Tang Corporation more brilliant…”</p><p>“You’ll never have that chance!”</p><p>The smile on Tang Xiu’s face instantly vanished. As Chen Liwei dazed, Tang Xiu pinched the man’s head and instantly cast a secret technique to scour his memory. If it was 3 years ago, even if Tang Xiu could forcibly check someone’s memory using this secret technique, it was very likely that he would only get some fragmentary memories.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
