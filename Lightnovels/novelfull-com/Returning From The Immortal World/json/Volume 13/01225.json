Although they also heard that Tang Xiu had been developing Nine Dragons Island, they never knew what it was like there. But it was just an isolated island, even if it was being developed, what could it develop into?</p><p>Tang Tang poked her head out. She looked at Tang Guosheng first and then asked, “Can I not go there, Grandpa? I still have classmates, friends, and studies to tend to in China.”</p><p>Tang Guosheng turned to Tang Xiu.</p><p>Tang Xiu cleared his throat and said, “Whether or not you decide to go to Nine Dragons Island is your call to make. House Tang may be a great clan in China as of now, but it’s only on the surface as there are so many cultivator clans in China and some really powerful families who have been hiding deep in the mountains and forests. I myself am a cultivator, and it’s my wish to turn my family into a cultivator clan. In this world, the so-called authority and wealth are nothing but a sidetrack, for the genuine main path is formidable strength that you yourself own.</p><p>“Such powerhouses have the ability to crush the stars with their own fist and can cross the universe unhindered, live forever and become existences above billions of souls. House Tang is my family, and I have always wished to turn it into a clan of powerhouses. This world we’re living in is but one of the countless worlds in this plane, and Earth is nothing but a speck of dust in this lower plane.</p><p>“The choice is in your hands whether you wish to stand at the summit to overlook whatever lies below, or continue being ants among other walks of life. Whatever it is, I’ll respect your choice.”</p><p>As his voice faded away, Tang Xiu conjured a secret art and surging energy then instantly formed a large tight net under everyone’s feet. His figure then flickered and instantly vanished from the room before he appeared in mid-air tens of meters high with everyone else around him.</p><p>“Ah…”</p><p>“Oh my God!”</p><p>“What’s going on?”</p><p>Every member of the Tang Family, including the old Patriarch, Tang Guosheng, looked horrified, tongue-tied and flabbergasted as they looked at the surroundings and all the buildings below. They felt like they were just pulled into a dream.</p><p>Tang Xiu went on lightly, “Celestial immortals in the legends are not just fairy tales. They’re real existences. I now provide you the opportunity to become one, but it is up to you whether you’ll take it or not.”</p><p>“I want to be a celestial immortal too!”</p><p>After the brief shock, Tang Tang immediately clenched her fists and shouted excitedly.</p><p>Tang Xiu smiled lightly in response. After bringing back everyone to the house, he said, “First Uncle, I’ll teach you a cultivation technique and will keep providing you cultivation resources. However, the Tang Family will rely on you to manage the affairs here. But I promise you that even if you’re the only person from our family staying here, nobody in our country will dare do anything to you. You don’t even need to move if some people dare to do so. Someone else will take care of it for you.”</p><p>“Who is this person?” asked Tang Yunpeng in a heavy voice.</p><p>“Duanmu Lin from the Special Abilities Bureau,” answered Tang Xiu with a light smile.</p><p>Tang Yunpeng immediately looked ecstatic upon hearing this and repeatedly nodded. “Xiu’er, I don’t want to stay here. I also want to go to Nine Dragons Island to cultivate. But I’ll stay here since you and father have decided so. But you must help me when I need it.”</p><p>“Please don’t worry about that, Uncle. House Tang in China will never fall as long as Tang Xiu is still alive.” Tang Xiu smiled and said, “I’ll return one person of our family to China 10 years later to take over your responsibilities here. The person who will be sent back is the most unsuitable one for cultivation and whose cultivation progresses the slowest.”</p><p>Tang Yunpeng’s eyes shone and he burst out laughing. “Alright! That would be great, Xiu’er. You’re really good.”</p><p>****</p><p>The next day.</p><p>The three brothers, Tang Guosheng, Tang Guoxing, and Tang Guoshou left China with their wives. No one knew how and when they left the country. They just simply vanished. Even their bodyguards and health workers were in the dark about it.</p><p>On the fourth day, Tang Yunde, Tang Min, Tang Yan, Tang Yunqing, and Tang Dong also left with their spouses. No one knew how they left, either. They just disappeared.</p><p>On the fifth day, Tang Ning, Tang Ying, Tang Wei, Tang Tang, and Tang Ji, with the exception of Chu Yi who was not of the same surname, also disappeared from Beijing and China.</p><p>On the seventh day, all the loyal subordinates who had been cultivated by House Tang also disappeared from Beijing and China as if they had just evaporated from the world. All the chain events made countless forces began to investigate, but no one was able to find any clues.</p><p>At the same time, the incidents that happened in the Tang Family finally broke out and all the affluent families in Beijing and some other powerful families and influential people in China mobilized their information network to the fullest to find out the whereabouts of House Tang’s core members.</p><p>However, they failed to find anything.</p><p>But during their investigation, they found that Tang Min had resigned, Tang Yunqing retired, and the rest of House Tang’s members in the government also resigned and left their posts voluntarily. Shortly after, all the companies owned by House Tang were merged into Magnificent Tang Corporation.</p><p>****</p><p>Beijing, House Tang’s residence.</p><p>Tang Yunpeng glanced around at the now-empty residence. There used to be some people living here, but the place looked dead now. In addition to tens of Tang Family’s martial artists who still stayed to protect him along with two Foundation Establishment experts from Tang Sect, there was no one else here.</p><p>Knock, knock…</p><p>The door was knocked, and Tang Yunpeng’s secret aide came in quickly and reported. “There’s a guest visiting, Patriarch.”</p><p>Tang Yunpeng frowned and said, “Again? How many waves has it been? I’m already spent dealing with it all day. Tell the guest that I’m too tired and have rested already.”</p><p>“The man claims to be Duanmu Lin. He said that you’d definitely meet him if I told you his name,” Zhu Jianhua whispered.</p><p>Duanmu Lin? As in the Director of the Special Abilities Bureau?</p><p>Tang Yunpeng’s heart jolted and he immediately got up to walk towards the door. When he came to the front courtyard, he saw Duanmu Lin standing quietly under a tree. He let out a smile and quickly greeted him. “Director Duanmu, why did you come here?”</p><p>Duanmu Lin sized him up and then smilingly said, “I promised Tang Xiu to visit House Tang’s residence in person and make it known to those countless eyes. That brat will definitely be mad at me if I don’t come.”</p><p>Angry with him?</p><p>Tang Yunpeng was shocked and faintly realized that the relationship between his nephew, Tang Xiu, and Duanmu Lin should be unusual. Then, he invited Duanmu Lin to the backyard and asked right after they took a seat, “Director Duanmu, is Xiu’er still in the capital? Have you met him?”</p><p>“No.” Duanmu Lin shook his head. Having said that, his eyes glanced at Zhu Jianhua.</p><p>After following Duanmu Lin’s gaze, Tang Yunpeng immediately understood and waved his hand. “Jianhua, go get something to eat and bring those two bottles of God’s Nectar. I must accompany Director Duanmu to a few cups of wine today.”</p><p>“Understood.”</p><p>Zhu Jianhua also realized that Duanmu Lin had something to discuss with Tang Yunpeng, so he nodded and left immediately.</p><p>Duanmu Lin nodded and smilingly said, “Yunpeng, I watched you grow up and even held you when you were born.”</p><p>Cough, cough…</p><p>Tang Yunpeng didn’t even reply and held his breath. After letting out several dry coughs, he squeezed out a wry smile with an awkward expression. “Haih, what you said truly can shock even the dead, Senior! How many years have passed?! How come it ever crossed your mind to even mention this?”</p><p>“Well, don’t you think we’re actually very close?” Duanmu Lin chuckled.</p><p>Tang Yunpeng stared blankly, keenly aware that Duanmu Lin’s visit was likely… to show goodwill?</p><p>But… why? This dignified Director of China’s Special Abilities Bureau may never show up in public, but he has enormous power in his hands. Even governors like me must always face him with humility. Why would he come here to show such goodwill all of a sudden?</p><p>Is it… because of Tang Xiu?</p><p>Tang Yunpeng nodded and then slowly said with a sincere expression, “Father and you are old friends, and you also have a deep relationship with Tang Xiu. The relationship between you and House Tang indeed goes way back, so it’s just natural that we are quite close.”</p><p>Duanmu Lin happily smiled and said, “Then I can rest assured since you already understand it. If anything, remember to mention me more in front of Tang Xiu later. Besides, I would likely need you and your family’s care in the future. Well, many years later.”</p><p>“But… I don’t quite understand what you said, Director Duanmu.” Tang Yunpeng hesitated.</p><p>“We’re close people, aren’t we?” Duanmu Lin replied meaningfully, “I think you should change the address for me in private, no?”</p><p>Tang Yunpeng hurriedly said, “Uncle Duanmu.”</p><p>Duanmu Lin chuckled and said, “By the way, House Tang will carry out a big plan about 10 or so years later. Or rather, it’s Tang Xiu who will carry out this plan. We all will be on the same side in the future, as in like a true family. But if Tang Xiu hasn’t told you what that plan is, there’s no need to ask more since you’ll naturally learn about it later.”</p><p>Tang Yunpeng nodded without a word. Then, he said, “Uncle Duanmu, I’ll speak directly since we’re now on the same boat. I’m afraid I need your help for the next 10 years if something happens.”</p><p>Duanmu Lin nodded. “As long as I still hold my position in the next few decades, I can guarantee that House Tang’s status in China will not be shaken. Your father has left China, but his departure won’t shake your family. That’s why I came to visit you today. It’s to show everyone else that Duanmu Lin is the backer behind House Tang.”</p><p>Tang Yunpeng was shocked. The statement even set off a storm in his heart. He had no idea how and what did Tang Xiu do to make Duanmu Lin speak like this.</p><p>Suddenly, Duanmu Lin chuckled and said, “Anyway, those Seniors above told me to convey a message to you. You’ve been in your current post for several years and you should move. What do you think of Shanghai?”</p><p>Tang Yunpeng’s pupils shrank. His body couldn’t help but tremble for a while before he replied seriously, “Shanghai is not bad. It’s great, actually.”</p><p>Duanmu Lin then got up, patted Tang Yunpeng’s shoulder and smilingly said, “Then prepare well! It may come tomorrow or maybe a few months later. Well, that’s all for my visit today. And remember to tell Tang Xiu to visit me at the Special Abilities Bureau HQ when you meet him later, okay?”</p><p>“Alright. Let me send you off, Senior.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
