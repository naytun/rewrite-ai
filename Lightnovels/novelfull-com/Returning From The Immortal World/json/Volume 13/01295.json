He put his hands on You Zhong’s shoulders and said in a toned-down voice, “Are you sure you’re not mistaken that he’s the Master of Aurelian Artificer Sect?”</p><p>“Yeah, he’s indeed the Aurelian Artificer Sect’s Master. I’ve seen him a few decades ago.” You Zhong firmly nodded and emphasized. “He’s very strong and likes to make friends with strong people from all walks of life. He definitely has more than 10 powerful friends in the neighboring stars. Certainly, it’s due to the expertise of his Aurelian Artificer Sect at refining more importantly since any good quality immortal artifacts are made by his sect here.”</p><p>“Do you perhaps know this Aurelian Artificer Sect, Master?” Gu Yan’er asked curiously.</p><p>“I’ve had some intersections with them in the past.” Tang Xiu nodded and slowly said, “I went to visit this Aurelian Artificer Sect roughly 2,000 years ago. At that time, I wanted to ask them to help me refine a certain immortal artifact. But I never thought that their refining expertise level was a lot worse than mine. Therefore, I picked a batch of refining materials from them and exchanged it with an ancient refining scripture as compensation.”</p><p>“Was the Master of Aurelian Artificer Sect before the man who’s now being besieged?” Gu Yan’er asked again with a curious face.</p><p>“No.” Tang Xiu shook his head.</p><p>Gu Yan’er hesitated for a moment and asked again, “Then what shall we do, Master? Do you plan to get involved?”</p><p>Tang Xiu slightly smiled and sent a voice transmission to Gu Yan’er. “Of course. My appearance has changed greatly and some former acquaintances may not be able to recognize me. Furthermore, given my current strength, I don’t think they will believe me even if I told them that I was once that Supreme powerhouse, either. But if anything, this artificer sect is useful and they can do something for us.”</p><p>Gu Yan’er’s expression shifted and she immediately understood Tang Xiu’s intention. The Great Tang Empire had over 200,000 cultivators and only had ordinary spirit artifacts for use as of now. But they were now in the Immortal World. If each of them could be equipped with an immortal sword, it would definitely make the Great Tang Empire’s combat force rise by another whole level.</p><p>Master’s move… he definitely wants to make this Aurelian Artificer Sect refine immortal artifacts for the Great Tang Empire!</p><p>Tens of kilometers away.</p><p>The Profound Immortal man who besieged Darknorth Immortal complacently smiled as he slashed Darknorth Immortal’s hand and loudly laughed. “Hahaha, you never thought that such a day would come, did you, Darknorth Immortal? You injured me severely back when you snatched the woman I liked, and this will mark the end of our previous grudges!”</p><p>Darknorth Immortal desperately tried to avoid it, but he had consumed too much Immortal Force and he was already severely injured. Now that he was already a spent force, he furiously roared under such grief and indignation. “Ditto Clearwater, Viola and I deeply love each other. It’s just a matter of justice for us to end up together. You’re just a despicable shit who keeps scheming on us from beginning to end. I hesitated due to our past friendship, so I didn’t take your dog life but severely injured you instead then. I never thought that you unexpectedly jumped out to strike me when I got severely injured. Do you really think you bugs can kill me here?”</p><p>“We are, of course, more than enough to fucking kill you, given your state!” Ditto Clearwater ridiculed. “As for that old ancestor of your smelter sect, hum hum hum… does he even have the balls to move? I got two ancestors from my Clearwater Clan here.”</p><p>“Fuck! I really regret not scattering your soul into oblivion previously!” Darknorth Immortal roared.</p><p>“Feeling sorry now, huh? You’re late!” Ditto Clearwater sneered.</p><p>Far away from them, Tang Xiu narrowed his eyes as he watched the situation unfolding. Then, he slowly said, “If I’m not wrong, those three Golden Immortals have been seriously injured and hold some fears, thus the reason they haven’t moved. This Polychromatic Lucent Starfield is indeed fraught with dangers that may appear at any time. If they keep fighting, they can easily fall here unless they’re lucky.”</p><p>GuYan’er nodded in response and said, “I think that the Aurelian Artificer expert is about to move, Master. He won’t just sit still and watch Darknorth Immoral be killed.”</p><p>“Yan’er, do you think you can easily get rid of those two Golden Immortals if you join hands with that Aurelian Artificer expert?” Tang Xiu asked.</p><p>“I alone am enough to kill those three,” Gu Yan’er confidently replied.</p><p>Tang Xiu nodded and said, “If so, then let’s move!”</p><p>The three of them flashed and appeared on the battle scene lightning fast. Tang Xiu shouted aloud, “Fellow Immortals of the artificer sect, I always heard that the Aurelian Artificer Sect’s Master, Darknorth Immortal is a bold and forthright man and likes to make friends from various people. It seems that fate brought us to meet here. I also hate this despicable bastard. Why don’t we join forces to kill them and take all their resources?”</p><p>The moment Darknorth Immortal heard him, he looked ecstatic and replied aloud, “Immortal friend, I’m indeed Darknorth Immortal, the Aurelian Artificer Sect’s Master! Thank you for helping me out, friends. Darknorth will always remember this grace today. You can have whatever you can find after killing them. This Darknorth will also take out some treasures as a thank you gift to all of you.”</p><p>“That’s a deal!”</p><p>As Tang Xiu saw Gu Yan’er flash towards the two Golden Immortals of Clearwater Clan, he immediately took out an immortal sword from his interspatial ring. Steamrolling sword energy billowed and instantly blasted to the side of Darknorth Immortal.</p><p>“Three of us shall join hands to kill these enemies!” Tang Xiu shouted in a deep voice.</p><p>You Zhong, on the other hand, could only force a bitter smile inwardly. But he could only bite the bullet to fight side by side with Tang Xiu and Darknorth Immortal. Darknorth Immortal unleashed everything he had to kill two Celestial Immortals and then flashed toward Tang Xiu.</p><p>“Take all of them!”</p><p>Tang Xiu threw a jade bottle and then controlled his immortal sword to constantly ward off the strikes of Clearwater Clan’s Celestial Immortals. At the same time, You Zhong directly pulled three other Celestial Immortals and engaged in intense combat with them.</p><p>Darknorth Immortal himself had long run out of any healing pills. After receiving the jade bottle, he quickly unplugged the cork and quickly took one pill without hesitation after he smelled the medicine scent fluttering from the inside. Given his current situation, he was perfectly aware that he would have no choice but to die if the other party didn’t help him. Hence, there was no need for the other party to lure him to use healing pills to harm him.</p><p>He quickly swallowed the Holy Healing pill. But after a short while, he let out a forced smile because the healing efficacy of the pill was appalling. Without hesitation, he quickly swallowed the remaining 19 healing pills inside.</p><p>Finally, the combined healing efficacy of so many Holy Healing pills helped him recover from his injuries. Taking advantage of this, he also took out an Essence Amassing Pill and quickly did his best to absorb its efficacy.</p><p>“GO THE FUCK AWAY!”</p><p>At this time, Darknorth Immortal was able to manipulate his immortal sword more powerfully than before. He instantly shot out his sword to ward off Ditto Clearwater’s sword that was about to hit Tang Xiu. At the same time, he finally refined the remaining efficacy of the pills and fused it with his own Immortal Force to launch a violently powerful strike.</p><p>The immortal sword slashed away, cutting Ditto Clearwater’s immortal sword into two pieces and split the man’s body into halves. The instant after, Darknorth Immortal coughed up a mouthful of blood. He had fully spent all the strength he had left, causing him to freefall downward unceasingly.</p><p>“Savage Sword—Demon Beheading!”</p><p>Coldness light flashed in Tang Xiu’s eyes. He was wary of that Profound Immortal, Ditto Clearwater, but he was not afraid of these Celestial Immortals. His immortal sword kept moving and striking, while he also unleashed the Devour divine ability. The flow of energy in the surroundings became distorted and the seven Celestial Immortals besieging him suddenly shook slightly.</p><p>“One more slash!”</p><p>As his immortal sword swept towards two enemies, Tang Xiu unleashed his divine sword. In a flash, a sword beam 10 kilometers long blasted out. The two Celestial Immortals whose attention was pulled to ward off the immortal sword were caught off guard and directly slain by the divine sword.</p><p>“Damn, I’m still too weak!”</p><p>Tang Xiu secretly forced a wry smile inwardly. Should his cultivation level improve one level higher to the Earth Immortal Stage, he was confident he could easily kill these Celestial Immortal Stage experts.</p><p>“WATCH OUT!”</p><p>Suddenly, Tang Xiu’s complexion slightly changed. He suddenly noticed a sword beam aiming to cut off Darknorth Immortal’s left arm. He didn’t bother to strike the rest and flashed to Darknorth Immortal’s position, grabbing his waist and flying down to the ground like a crashing meteor.</p><p>Of the three remaining Celestial Immortals, three of them were still ganging up on You Zhong, whereas the other six were chasing Tang Xiu and Darknorth Immortal. It was like they vowed to never rest before they killed both of them.</p><p>At the other battle nearby, Gu Yan’er and the ancestor of Aurelian Artificer Sect were already engaged in combat with the two Clearwater Clan’s Golden Immortals. The Aurelian Artificer Sect’s ancestor was seriously injured, but he didn’t hesitate to go all out in his fight. What shocked him was that the female who helped him turn out to be very powerful. Every attack she launched alone caused his two enemies to become severely injured even though they had desperately tried to avoid getting hit at their vital points.</p><p>“Step aside!”</p><p>Gu Yan’er shouted in a cold voice. Her figure was as though turning to a cascade of sword images that instantly flashed to strike the Clearwater Clan’s two ancestors, one of whom had his waist directly mutilated as the scattering sword energy cut his immortal body into pieces.</p><p>On the ground.</p><p>The moment Tang Xiu landed, he powerfully threw Darknorth Immortal away and shouted in a deep voice, “Find a place to hide and quickly restore your strength!”</p><p>After that, he straightly ceased his control over the Immortal Sword and only manipulated his divine sword to engage those six Celestial Immortals. Tang Xiu kept unleashing various immortal arts and divine abilities very smoothly. Coupled with the aid of the Devour supernatural power, he kept those six Celestial Immortals at bay, making them lose any chance to attack perfectly, and barring any chance to kill him for a while.</p><p>“Star Devourer Insect!” Tang Xiu yelled all of a sudden.</p><p>Suddenly a streak of light jetted out of the tip of his finger. In nearly an instant, the Star Devourer Insect’s body was sharply inflated hundreds of times and sent out a terrifyingly powerful aura. Sticky silk thread was shot from it and directly wrapped the six Celestial Immortals’ limbs. Two of them who were the closest to it were pulled by a devouring force from its mouth and directly devoured, whereas the other four were beheaded by Tang Xiu with his divine sword.</p><p>Shortly after, Tang Xiu didn’t cease his momentum and streaked up into the sky and went to the besieged You Zhong in a few breaths.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
