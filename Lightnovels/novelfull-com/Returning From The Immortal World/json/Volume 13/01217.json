Back in Star City, he set up an array around his house, but he forgot to arrange one in the Bluestar Villa Complex. Given how crazy “the fight” between him and Mu Wanying last night was, it was likely she could see it clearly, wasn’t it?</p><p>I really must speed up my cultivation as fast as possible, so my sense of the surrounding space can get much keener and wider. As long as Tang An follows me, I can find her easily even if she hides in the void.</p><p>After reminding himself about this issue, Tang Xiu turned to look outside through the window.</p><p>After they arrived at the airport, he easily found Zhang Xinya and Zhang Xinyue though he didn’t know how long they had waited for him. The two females were donning similar attire, both wearing peaked caps, large sunglasses, and masks, along with a similar large suitcase next to each.</p><p>“Have you been waiting for a long time?” Tang Xiu greeted them and asked.</p><p>“Nah, we just arrived here too,” answered Zhang Xinya. “By the way, are we flying directly to Saipan?”</p><p>“Yeah.” Tang Xiu nodded. “We’ll fly directly to Saipan. We have choppers standing by there and we’ll board them to Nine Dragons Island. By the way, I haven’t asked your reason for going there, though. Are you going there for vacation, or to stay there permanently?”</p><p>“I’m staying there permanently,” Zhang Xinya said.</p><p>“Eh? Don’t you still have jobs here?” Tang Xiu asked in wonder. “What about you, Xinyue? Don’t you have your beauty shop to run?”</p><p>“I’ve resigned and already made an announcement that I’ll leave the entertainment industry and won’t make any public appearances in the future anymore,” answered Zhang Xinya. “As for Xinyue, she already sold her shop 2 weeks ago, so we have nothing to do for the time being.”</p><p>Tang Xiu thought about something and then asked, “Do you want to keep living there, or are you leaving with me in the future too?”</p><p>“Huh? Leaving? Where to?” asked Zhang Xinyue.</p><p>Tang Xu turned to Zhang Xinya and asked, “You didn’t tell her?”</p><p>“No.” Zhang Xinya shook her head.</p><p>Tang Xiu’s lips moved and transmitted his voice straight to Zhang Xinyue’s ear. “I’m a cultivator. I’m sure you know what this means. The ultimate goal of any cultivator is to reach a higher cultivation stage and ultimately ascend to become an immortal. If there’s no accident, I’ll ascend to the Immortal World in a few decades, and I’ll also take a lot of my subordinates with me. I may not return to Earth for thousands of years.”</p><p>Zhang Xinyue shuddered as incredulity filled her eyes. It was something that never crossed her mind. Even in her wildest dream, she never thought that aside from Earth, the Immortal World in the legend turned out to actually exist. Everyone knew that this place was only in Xianxia stories!</p><p>****</p><p>It was night when the four of them arrived in Nine Dragons Island and Zhang Xinyue was still unable to fully digest everything Tang Xiu had said. After Mu Qingping arranged everything for Zhang Xinya and Zhang Xinyue to stay on the island, she went to Tang Xiu’s room and asked, “Can you teach me cultivation techniques too? I want to become a powerful cultivator. That ability to fly above the clouds and summon the forces of nature is so amazing and I love it.”</p><p>Tang Xiu couldn’t help laughing and then explained, “I must tell you that treading on the cultivation path is very dangerous. You must endure pains that most average people won’t be able to bear and the dangers you’ll face are also unimaginable. You may have to face other people in the future if you choose to be a cultivator and even face the battle between immortals at that time.”</p><p>“Will you protect me at that time?” asked Zhang Xinyue.</p><p>Tang Xiu nodded. “I’ll certainly protect you. Unless I’m killed.”</p><p>Zhang Xinyue beamed with a smile and walked straight to Tang Xiu. She wrapped her arms around his neck and said, “Then I won’t be afraid since you’re going to protect me! You’re a cultivator and so is my older sister. Hence, I’m going to wherever you go in the future as well.”</p><p>“That reminds me, where’s your older sister now?” asked Tang Xiu.</p><p>“She said she’s tired and is already sleeping in her room,” answered Zhang Xinyue.</p><p>Tang Xiu pondered for a while and then nodded. “Alright, then. Stay in my room for tonight and I’ll teach you a cultivation technique and what the cultivation path really is. But I can’t guarantee what level you can reach in the future. What I can tell you now is that you must reach the Spirit Formation Stage in a few decades if you want to leave for the Immortal World with me.”</p><p>“What is this Spirit Formation Stage, though?” Zhang Xinya curiously asked, “Will I become a powerful cultivator who can fly if I reach this Spirit Formation Stage?”</p><p>“You will learn about cultivation levels from some others in the future.” Tang Xiu said, “As for Spirit Formation Stage cultivators, they definitely can fly and are very powerful. Even I myself may not be your match if your cultivation is at the Spirit Formation Stage now.”</p><p>“Alright. I’ll begin to practice. I must become a cultivator.” Zhang Xinyue clenched her fists excitedly.</p><p>Four hours were then spent to teach Zhang Xinyue all the acupuncture points and meridian routes of the human body. Tang Xiu taught her a set of very powerful cultivation techniques in the Immortal World and he didn’t even hesitate to condense a drop of his blood essence to integrate it into her body and made her heart absorb it.</p><p>It was already late in the night when Tang Xiu went to the alchemy room in Nine Dragons Island. Right as he was about to enter the main hall, he felt heatwaves from the interior. After he entered, he found that the temperature inside was at least 20 degrees higher than the outside, which could steam ordinary people in no time.</p><p>“Ji Chimei!”</p><p>The alchemy room was quite spacious with the size of about several hundred square meters. Shelves were arranged against the wall and filled with various jade bottles and containers along with some medicinal materials, minerals, and bones of fierce beasts suitable for storage at high temperatures.</p><p>A respectful expression painted Ji Chimei’s face after she found that Tang Xiu was here. She immediately greeted and saluted. “When did you arrive, Lord?”</p><p>“I must concoct some pills for use in the not so distant future, which I’ve estimated will take about 4 days.”</p><p>“But the furnace still has an elixir I’ve been concocting and it will take a few days for the refining to be successful, Lord.” Ji Chimei hesitated before she continued, “We only have two pill furnaces in this vault, but the quality of the other one is rather average and usually used by Pill Apprentices. Would you like me to discard the pills in this furnace? Or…”</p><p>Tang Xiu chuckled and replied, “I have my own furnace.”</p><p>Having said that, he took out the Demon God Soul Devourer Cauldron from his interspatial ring and placed it in the spacious alchemy room. Shortly after, he quickly arranged several arrays under the cauldron. Only then did he turn to Ji Chimei and ask, “By the way, what do you think about my stove? It’s great, isn’t it?”</p><p>Ji Chimei herself had very keen sight and her heart pounded hard after seeing the Demon God Soul Devourer Cauldron. She circled around the cauldron a few times and observed it carefully before praising. “This stove you obtained is comparable to the top immortal devices, my Lord. But my sense is telling me that this furnace isn’t just suitable for concocting pills but also can be used by artificers to manufacture weapons and tools. Am I correct, my Lord?”</p><p>“You have good eyes, as always.” Tang Xiu smilingly said, “This divine furnace can indeed be used for alchemy and tools manufacturing. Chimei, your current strength is perhaps stronger than me, but I think you’re still a bit behind me in regards to manufacturing devices and alchemy. Stay here for 10 days and I’ll teach you some secrets of alchemy and refinement. You must observe and learn well since you may become the most important subordinate under me as an expert Alchemist and Artificer who can manufacture immortal elixirs and devices.”</p><p>Ji Chimei’s eyes shone and she gratefully replied, “This subordinate will spare no effort to study so that I can live up to Lord’s expectation in the future.”</p><p>10 days may seem short and Tang Xiu stayed in the alchemy room all the time. He concocted a massive number of pills with various effects in the first four days. These pills were also very beneficial to Golden Core cultivators even though the efficacy was lacking to those at the Nascent Soul Stage.</p><p>From the 5th to the 8th day, Tang Xiu continuously manufactured magic devices. These tools and weapons were not refined using Immortal force, hence why all of them didn’t reach the standard quality level in the Immortal World although they could still be ranked as top magic tools. Any of these tools could easily garner countless people’s envy and desire and even very likely to set off a bloody storm.</p><p>The last two days were spent to refine a full set of ten array disks, all of which were then given to Gu Xiaoxue, while he himself manufactured two sets of low-grade array disks. He planned the later to be auctioned at the Genesis auction. Further, he also spent the last 2 days to manufacture a total of 100 amulets and talismans, all of which were also handed over to Gu Xiaoxue. He then made another 100 amulets with much less might for the Genesis auction.</p><p>“Huff…”</p><p>Just as Tang Xiu came out of the alchemy room, he saw Gu Yan’er standing outside, seemingly having been waiting for him. A beaming smile then appeared on her soul-captivating beautiful face.</p><p>“Master!”</p><p>Gu Yan’er didn’t seem to be bothered by Tang Xiu’s naked upper body or the sweat slipping from his streamlined muscles. She quickly came to Tang Xiu’s side and wrapped her arm around Tang Xiu’s.</p><p>“Why did you come out of the exquisite pagoda?” Tang Xiu chuckled and said, “I already planned to go there to visit you after I’m done with the chore these ten days, you know!”</p><p>“Well, I’ve already suppressed all my injuries and I’m getting better every day. I should be fully healed in about a few years.” Gu Yan’er lightly smiled and said, “By the way, I just refined 2 pills for you since I got nothing to do for the last 2 days, Master. It should be beneficial for you.”</p><p>“I don’t think any Immortal-type pills can have much effect on me now unless I can get my hands on some Immortal Demon Pills.” Tang Xiu shook his head and smilingly said, “It’s just unfortunate that only those Archdemons in the Demon Realm possess this type of pill.”</p><p>Gu Yan’er opened her palm and 2 pills, one black and one white, suddenly appeared on it. A dark stream of light kept flashing from the black pill, whereas the white one seemed to emit rippling waves.</p><p>“Immortal Demon Pill?”</p><p>Tang Xiu’s pupils contracted as incredulity filled his eyes. Never had it crossed his mind that Gu Yan’er was able to concoct the Immortal Demon Pill and obtained the materials to concoct it. It must be noted that the medicinal herbs and ingredients needed to concoct it were extremely rare.</p><p>“This is not the genuine Immortal Demon Pill, Master. The effect should be nearly similar but the efficacy and energy contained in it are 10 times worse than the genuine ones.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
