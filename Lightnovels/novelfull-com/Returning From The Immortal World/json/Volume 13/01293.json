He then cast a secret art to wipe off the previous owners’ mark on the rings and then swiftly stuffed them into his own interspatial ring.</p><p>You Zhong, who stood beside him, wore a slightly complicated expression. He used to hate these You Clan people, but now they were like lambs getting butchered and fell to the ground. A lot of those guys who had bullied him countless times had been killed, yet the reverse in fortune gave him mixed and complicated feelings.</p><p>After a long time, two lines of tears slipped down his face. The green veins on his forehead then protruded as he looked up to the sky and screamed loudly, “Do you see that, Mother? Retribution has come. These wretched You clansmen have been punished. Your soul in Heaven can now rest in peace!”</p><p>Suddenly, from the deepest place of the You Clan residence, an old voice resounded and made this part of the world shake. “Who comes to my You Clan to make trouble? Do you think the Yous are nobodies?”</p><p>Gu Yan’er retracted her immortal sword and shifted her attention to the coming person. Disdain immediately flitted across her eyes as she icily said, “Heh, your You Clan does have many people, but they are nothing but ants! Brat, it wasn’t easy for you to cultivate up to the Golden Immortal Stage, so you had better open your clan’s treasure vault and hand over all your wealth if you want to live.”</p><p><em>This is just… a damn robbery?!</em></p><p>You Haoran was unable to believe his own ears when he appeared before Gu Yan’er. He could sense a great power coming from her. Yet, even his wildest dream, he never thought that a Golden Immortal Stage expert would be so nonchalant as to rob his clan and disregard her own reputation. What kind of treasure did his clan have for her to be so brazen?</p><p>“May I know who your excellency is? There’s no way robbing us is your true intention, no?” You Haoran asked in a deep voice.</p><p>“Meh, me, a dignified Golden Immortal has greedy eyes and wants to rob your poor Clan? You’re dreaming! I came here with my Master just to exact some revenge. But your clan hoarding those resources is kinda a waste. Might as well let me and my Master do something good and help you collect them instead.”</p><p><em>Master?!</em></p><p>You Haoran was shaken inwardly. This woman was already at the Golden Immortal Stage, wouldn’t the person who deserved to be her Master be at least someone at the Perfected Golden Immortal Stage?</p><p>If that person was indeed a Perfected Golden Immortal expert, then they were people he couldn’t afford to fight against. Even he himself was likely unable to contend with this woman.</p><p>Still, You Haoran really wanted to get to the bottom of the matter. As his eyes shifted to Tang Xiu and You Zhong, he became stunned. To his surprise, Tang Xiu was not even at the Immortal Stage. He was just a Crossing Tribulation Stage cultivator. However, he recalled Gu Yan’er’s statement just now and immediately thought inwardly that this guy must be a Perfected Golden Immortal who was playing a pig that would eat the tiger.</p><p>“Senior, the You Clan is willing to hand over our wealth if it is what you need. However, I’m not sure whether Senior’s companion had any feud with my clan. I’m willing to hand over the culprit to you to mediate the issue.”</p><p>Gu Yan’er slightly creased her brows and muttered, “Well, continuously killing is just impossible, I think. Master is a very soft-hearted man. I just really don’t get why he always shows mercy to these ants as a dignified Supreme of the Immortal World.”</p><p>After that, Gu Yan’er flew towards Tang Xiu.</p><p>However, her mumblings left a tremendous shock to You Haoran, and a chill instantly ran down his back. In particular, her last four words sent out rolling thunderclaps in his heart.</p><p><em>The Immortal World Supreme? Is this mysterious man one of the Immortal World’s Supremes?</em></p><p><em>But of the entire Immortal World, only less than 100 experts reached the Supremacy Stage, right? Then, who and which terrifying existence is he?</em></p><p>You Zhong suddenly flew forward. He could clearly sense You Haoran’s fear. He thought that he could take the chance to take advantage of the fact that he was related to these powerful people to strike his target. Therefore, he stood a kilometer away from You Clan’s ancestor and indifferently said, “Hand over You Zun’s wife, that Lan Shi, as well as those 13 people in the clan close with her. They are all damned people!”</p><p>You Haoran slightly frowned. He knew who You Zun was since the man was one of the six Deacons of the Clan and a Profound Immortal Stage expert. However, he recalled that these two people had a fearsome cultivation level, so he coldly issued an order. “Grab You Zun’s wife Lan Shi and those 13 people who are close with her! Investigate clearly on those who have feuds with this friend and execute them later!”</p><p>The moment the order was issued, a number of You Clan’s people bustled about and nearly 1,000 people led by You Zun’s wife, Lan Shi, were all killed on the spot.</p><p>With bitterness in his heart, You Haoran respectfully said, “We have killed everyone who should be killed. I have also sent some people to the You Clan’s treasure vault. Please…”</p><p>“A small clan is likely to have some trash stored in the treasure vault. Yan’er, go deal with it and return quickly. We must still visit the other two Houses.” Tang Xiu lightly smiled in response.</p><p>The other two Houses?!</p><p>You Haoran was shaken yet again. His unwillingness was instantly replaced by gloating. Although his clan lost a lot this time, he knew what he must do to work around it to avoid greater losses. But the old fogeys of those two Houses had a bad temper. It was very likely that their two clans would become rivers of blood with bodies littered everywhere should they have a fallout with these people.</p><p>A few minutes later, Gu Yan’er came back and nodded slightly. The three of them then stopped paying attention to You Haoran and flew straight to the distance.</p><p>You Haoran stood in the air and kept gazing at the direction the trio just disappeared into. He then took a deep breath and said in a deep tone, “Notify all the clan’s disciples to not walk around in the near future. All of you are to stay still, and those who provoke those people won’t need to be killed by others as I’ll kill them with my own hands!”</p><p><em>Whoosh!</em></p><p>A stalwart and stout man appeared next to You Haoran with a furious expression. Holding back his deep fury, he said, “Sixth Uncle, why should you compromise with them? Shouldn’t you be able to make them stay behind given your strength?”</p><p>You Haoran turned to him and a cold light flashed in his eyes as he indifferently said, “Me, holding them here? Do you really think I can do that? She’s at least at the late-stage of the Golden Immortal Stage, and she called that man Master. Do you really think I can pull out such a stunt?!”</p><p>The stout man was aghast and asked, “That woman is a late-stage Golden Immortal expert?”</p><p>“Heh, why do you think I would compromise, then? Do you really think I’m so ruthless as to throw away the lives of the Yous’ offspring? Hmph… if there was only that woman alone, I would’ve activated the You Clan’s protection array already and I might be able to trade blows with her for some time. But as for her unfathomably deep Master, do you know about his cultivation level?”</p><p>The stalwart man hesitated and responded, “Could it be that he’s a Perfected Golden Immortal?”</p><p>“Nope, he’s a Supreme.” You Haoran shook his head. “Just a casual strike from him is enough to destroy the entire territory of our clan. Fortunately, he didn’t want to be bothered to do anything to us, else you all would’ve become dead bodies, including myself.”</p><p><em>Gasp…</em></p><p>The burly man couldn’t help but gasp after hearing this.</p><p>****</p><p>The other territory in the Evergreen Shrub Planet belonged to the Blue Clan.</p><p>After the trio arrived, Gu Yan’er stunned You Zhong directly and casually threw him to the corner before she sneaked into the Blue Clan with Tang Xiu. Their arrival this time did not alarm anyone in the Blue Clan, and Tang Xiu cracked all the arrays laid out everywhere by this clan personally. Gu Yan’er, on the other hand, was responsible for looting the Blue Clan’s treasure vault. After two days, the duo had ransacked 80% of the Blue Clan’s wealth.</p><p>Afterward, the duo took the fainted You Zhong and appeared in another House’s domain, carried out the same “standard operational procedures”, and then left the Evergreen Scrub Star directly to the vast starry sky.</p><p>“Fuck the You Clan!”</p><p>“You’re really damned, You Clan!”</p><p>Just a few days after they left, a furious roar resounded from the Blue Clan and the other clan. A large number of experts from both parties immediately gathered in a short time to attack the You Clan. The reason was simple. Thieves from the You Clan had stolen nearly all their wealth.</p><p>But Tang Xiu and Gu Yan’er didn’t bother to think about all these trivial things. They dragged You Zhong to find a desolate planet and stayed there before going into seclusion. Tang Xiu spent 3 months in seclusion and, instead of absorbing the energy in the Immortal Crystals, he chose to go all out to absorb the Immortal Force in the Immortal Stones. After three months, he finally welcomed his Immortal Tribulation.</p><p>His cultivation technique, the Heavenly Art of Cosmic Genesis, was a top-grade cultivation art in the Demon Realm. Even those Demon Gods would reap great benefits by cultivating it. However, Tang Xiu himself didn’t have any demonic energy, but the Primal Chaos energy that was several levels higher than demonic energy.</p><p>Therefore the cause of the fearsomely terrifying Immortal Tribulation for him. The might of his Immortal Tribulation was far greater than any immortal’s tribulation. Even Gu Yan’er, who stood thousands of miles away had a worried look on her face, whereas You Zhong who was next to her, wore a strange expression. He stared bewilderedly at the area where Tang Xiu was, unable to express his bewildering feelings inside.</p><p>The Master of this Golden Immortal Stage female had just crossed a tribulation. But there was a ridiculous matter that was truly the first unprecedented universe-shaking epoch he had ever heard.</p><p>Therefore, You Zhong recalled the words Gu Yan’er muttered at the You Clan residence. All their antics gave him a comical feeling that soared all of a sudden. That Immortal World’s Supreme stunt was definitely a bluff. Yet, it was hard for him to believe that even the You Clan’s ancestor bought it and even personally moved to get rid of his mortal enemies and offered most of their clan’s wealth “willingly”.</p><p>As of now, Tang Xiu’s figure was standing in the midst of the Immortal Tribulation. An arm-thick lightning bolt struck his body, but it wasn’t able to destroy his body’s defenses. Electric sparks like snakes coursed through his whole being as though a cloth that rubbed his body from head to toe.</p><p>A twister, mixed with surging Immortal Force enveloped Tang Xiu, but the terrifying twister was destroyed every time Tang Xiu punched it.</p><p>At the same time, thousands of planets in the surroundings slightly trembled. Each of these celestial bodies had their most vital life force madly extracted by Tang Xiu. He kept absorbing it into his body while at the same time using it to withstand the Heavenly Tribulation. The thousands of celestial bodies inside him began to swell in size and became as big as Earth after he had withstood 81 Lightning bolts.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
