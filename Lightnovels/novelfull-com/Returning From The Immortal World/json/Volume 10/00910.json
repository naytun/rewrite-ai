But in my eyes, he’s both just and evil with an unsociable and eccentric character. He’ll never provoke others on his own initiative if they don’t provoke him first.”</p><p>Still, Song Donglai didn’t let go of his prejudice because of Ao Wei’s explanation. He retorted back in a heavy voice, “Our Blood Python Array plan is very important; we must not let any outsiders mix in unless we have life-and-death camaraderie with the person. Just think. We’re currently facing our mortal enemy, and if some miscalculations do happen, we’ll end up very bad off.”</p><p>“You and Gong Quan have yet to get in touch with Han Sen, so you both don’t understand him,” said Ao Wei calmly. “But I have a very close bond with him since we are brothers in life-and-death. I can guarantee you that he won’t only help us, but he can also be friends with both of you.”</p><p>Friends?</p><p>Gong Quan didn’t flinch upon hearing that since he had heard of the relationship between Ao Wei and Han Sen many times, but Song Donglai had not. He felt his scalp tingling on the thought of this lunatic as it was his first time hearing of the idea.</p><p>After some time passed, Song Donglai reluctantly nodded and said, “Brother Ao, I’ll take your gamble since you said Han Sen is your friend. But if we were to lose, then we three brothers will definitely set off towards the path to the Netherworld. Though if we do win this gamble, we’ll be the carps that leap the dragon gate and become the existences in legend.”</p><p>“I’ll take the gamble,” firmly shouted Gong Quan.</p><p>Ao Wei looked at his two brothers with satisfaction and contained a soaring spirit inside. He then said loudly, “I don’t have 100% confidence about the outcome since I’m also gambling. But I’m sure the process will be splendid while gambling with you both, my two brothers!”</p><p>“Hahaha…”</p><p>The trio burst into wild laughter.</p><p>Amid their laughter, the door was knocked and a bald middle-aged man in a black suit came inside. He looked at the trio who were laughing loudly as he quickly came to the front of Song Donglai and respectfully said, “Boss, there’s something I need to report to you.”</p><p>Song Donglai raised his brows and asked, “What is it?”</p><p>“Two guests just came to our venue; one of them asked to dine in the boxes we have reserved since the rest of the boxes are completely occupied,” reported the bald man.</p><p>With a slight change in expression, Song Donglai asked, “Who’s he? How does he know we have reserved boxes?”</p><p>The bald man shook his head and said, “I only know that this man’s surname is Tang. He looks around 21 something and his family seems to have a restaurant business as well. But I dunno about anything else.”</p><p>“You don’t know much about him, yet you reported this matter to me? Is your brain dead or something?” chided Song Donglai angrily. “Tell him we have no boxes left reserved. Let them wait for ordinary boxes and get the hell out if he doesn’t want to wait.”</p><p>“Understood!” answered the bald man immediately.</p><p>Inside the reception lounge.</p><p>After Manager Wang received the message from her walkie-talkie, she looked at Tang Xiu with a cloudy expression, “I’m sorry. I was just informed that the two reserved boxes have already been occupied by other people who are dining there. Two Sirs, you may have to wait for other boxes! Of course, you can also have a look at other places if you don’t want to wait.”</p><p>Tang Xiu slightly frowned. He didn’t care if he really couldn’t dine in this place. But he sensed something very particular when he just arrived here, so he was a bit reluctant to leave now. He pondered for a moment before he took out his handset and dialed a cell number.</p><p>“Old Cripple, you haven’t completely left the Liu Family yet, and there’s something I need your help with. I think it can be solved by using the status of the Liu Family in Chang City.”</p><p>“What instructions do you have for me, Divine Doctor Tang?” asked Yang Shi.</p><p>“Have you heard of the Green Lake Agricola? I’m currently in the venue and want to dine here,” said Tang Xiu. “But there’s not even an ordinary box left at present here. Do you have any way to make the owner of this venue give me a box?”</p><p>“Give me a few minutes, Divine Doctor Tang,” said Yang Shi without hesitation.</p><p>Manager Wang, who stood in front of Tang Xiu, could hear his conversation. She was surprised and amazed—the Liu Family of Chang City? She knew that it was the first family in Chang City, yet this young man surnamed Tang knew someone from this family? If he did, then the Boss must really use that box reserved for the distinguished guests.</p><p>Li Qing raised his thumb up and praised, “Making use of your network is kinda great, Brother Tang. You just made Old Cripple submit to you, and you use it now. I’m truly convinced!”</p><p>“Then accomplish what I told you well, and work hard for me in the future,” said Tang Xiu with a faint smile, “Maybe you can also accumulate personal connections like me later.”</p><p>Li Qiang rubbed his hands and grinningly said, “Well, people do say that one can benefit from having influential friends, so you’ll be my big backer in the future.”</p><p>“Pfft…”</p><p>Manager Wang couldn’t help but laugh as she felt that the conversation of the duo was very funny.</p><p>In the innermost box of the Agricola.</p><p>Song Donglai, Ao Wei, and Gong Quan just tossed down two glasses of wine and were about to continue discussing some more important issues when a mobile phone began ringing. The former grabbed the phone, but when he saw the name on the screen, his expression suddenly changed and made a shushing gesture to Ao Wei and Gong Quan. Then he picked up the call and smilingly said, “Patriarch Liu, it’s been a long time since our last meeting. I always think of you! How did you remember to call me?”</p><p>“Well, I never went to someone’s place except on business or needed some help, Boss Song. It’s also because of this issue since a very distinguished guest of my Liu Family wants to dine in your Green Lake Agricola. Could you please arrange a box for him?” the voice of Liu Pinxin, the Family Head of Liu Family was heard from the handset.</p><p>Song Dong stared blankly before he hurriedly said, “Since its an honored guest of the Liu Family, then he’s also an honored patron of my Green Lake Agricola. May I know when the said party will come over? I’m going to greet him in person.”</p><p>“He’s surnamed Tang and he’s already in your Green Lake Agricola.”</p><p>“A family name Tang?”</p><p>Song Donglai suddenly recalled the matter that had been just reported to him. He abruptly got up and said, “I think I know who the person is, Patriarch Liu. Please rest assured. I’ll arrange it immediately.”</p><p>“Thank you.”</p><p>As the phone call ended, Song Donglai wore a strange expression and said, “It seems like there’s quite a great personage coming to my place. To think that he can actually move the Patriarch of the first family of Chang City to speak for him; his background surely must be very extraordinary.”</p><p>“The Lius of Chang City?” asked Ao Wei with a surprised expression. “That Old Cripple’s family?”</p><p>“Yeah,” affirmed Song Donglai with a solemn face.</p><p>“If so, then you’ve gotta arrange it well!” Ao Wei nodded and said, “The Lius of Chang City are not some ordinary folks, especially that Old Cripple. She has quite deep friendships with the elders of many families under our Occult Sect.”</p><p>Song Donglai nodded without speaking and quickly left the box. He soon appeared in front of Tang Xiu after the bald big man took him there.</p><p>“I’m really sorry for being disrespectful; all the fault is on me. I’m Song Donglai, the owner of this Green Lake Agricola. I didn’t know that Brother Tang was visiting my venue, so I didn’t greet you! Additionally, I didn’t know that you’re also a distinguished guest of the Liu Family of Chang City. I hope Brother Tang doesn’t feel offended for being neglected previously,” greeted Song Donglai politely.</p><p>Tang Xiu casually looked at him and said indifferently, “It’s alright. Please lead the way!”</p><p>“Ugh…”</p><p>Right as Song Donglai saw Tang Xiu’s face, he didn’t exchange more amenities and was somewhat annoyed by Tang Xiu’s indifference. However, he didn’t want to take it out on Tang Xiu out of respect to the Liu Family. He no longer spoke and directly brought Tang Xiu and Li Qiang to the VIP box.</p><p>“Manager Wang, you’ll be the host!”</p><p>After speaking, Song Donglai cupped his fists to Tang Xiu and Li Qiang, then turned and left.</p><p>As for Manager Wang herself, she was secretly shocked and amazed back when Song Donglai appeared. As one who was very experienced in dealing with people, however, she could tell that Tang Xiu and her Boss were in a rather odd situation at this moment. After pressing down her shock, she said, “Two Sirs, the menu will be sent by the waiters immediately. But if you both need anything, please don’t hesitate to tell them.”</p><p>“We know. You can go tend to your own business,” said Tang Xiu.</p><p>Manager Wang nodded and quickly headed to the outside. In normal times, she was usually the one responsible with entertaining the distinguished guests in the VIP box. However, today her Boss was obviously not happy, so she couldn’t risk being partial to these two young men.</p><p>After half an hour later, Tang Xiu and Li Qiang were thoroughly enjoying themselves with their meals. The venison dishes of the Green Lake Agricola did indeed taste great. However, Tang Xiu still remembered the peculiar circumstances that shrouded this place, so he abstained from drinking.</p><p>‘I should take a stroll around after this,” thought Tang Xiu.</p><p>However, just as this thought fleeted away, the VIP box’s door was knocked on. After it was opened, Yang Shi came in along with a fifty-plus-year-old man.</p><p>“We’re not disturbing you, Divine Doctor Tang?” Yang Shi walked in with her walking stick and asked.</p><p>Tang Xiu’s eyes swept over before falling on the old man. He inquired, “It’s alright. Who’s this, though?”</p><p>“He’s my son, Liu Pinxin, the current Head of the Liu Family, Divine Doctor Tang,” said Yang Shi quickly. “Hey, Pinxin! What are you gawking for? Hurry and greet Divine Doctor Tang!”</p><p>“Greetings, Divine Doctor Tang,” hurriedly greeted Liu Pinxin while cupping his fists.</p><p>Tang Xiu nodded at him and, after a moment of contemplation, he said, “Thank you for tonight’s matter. Although your mother promised me to leave the Liu Family, I’m going to give you a promise as well. If your family faces difficulties in the future that even your mother can’t solve it, you can find me once.”</p><p>Li Pinxin’s eyes lit up and he immediately looked excited. He had already heard about Tang Xiu’s identity from his mother, so he knew that this young man was an unfathomable cultivator. Yet, such a powerful person gave his commitment to his Liu Family.</p><p>This commitment… was definitely a good deed for the Liu Family!</p><p>With a look of gratitude, Liu Pinxin responded, “Thank you so much, Divine Doctor Tang. Also, is there anything else you need here? I’ll arrange it immediately.”</p><p>“There’s no need for that.” Tang Xiu shook his head.</p><p>Liu Pinxin nodded and glanced at his mother, Zhang Shi, and then paced back half a step, no longer speaking.</p><p>Zhang Shi smiled and said, “How about I make Pinxin accompany you during your stay in Chang City, Divine Doctor Tang? You can tell him if there’s anything you need.”</p><p>“Hahaha.” Tang Xiu couldn’t help but laugh and said, “No need for that! Besides, he’s a dignified Patriarch of the first family of Chang City. How could I do that to him? Thanks for the good intention, though. You two can go back.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
