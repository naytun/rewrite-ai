He knew that terrifyingly powerful divergent races such as vampires and Beastmen truly existed on Earth, as well as those the likes of wizards and reclusive figures and experts who stayed under the radar. Back in the day, he and his brothers had also faced these kinds of existences.</p><p>And yet, why would Tang Xiu dare to promise Tom Reggie that he would become as powerful as these terrifying things? Is he talking nonsense, or is he telling the truth?</p><p>“Tang Xiu…”</p><p>Song Guanghui called out, but Tang Xiu raised his hand and interrupted him to finish his words.</p><p>Tang Xiu shot an intense look at Tom Reggie and continued speaking with a deep voice, “You must understand that you won’t become my confidant even if you choose to submit. But I can guarantee that your strength will greatly improve, and your lifespan will even be several times longer.”</p><p>“What do you mean a longer lifespan?” asked Tom Reggie.</p><p>“For instance, if you can normally live to 100 years old and choose to submit to me, I will not only make you stronger, but even stronger than the current Spectre. You can live for 200, 300, or 400 years more. Don’t doubt me about it. You clearly know my character and I never talk big, nor have I talked about any nonsensical things.”</p><p>“That’s impossible. Absolutely impossible.” Tom Reggie shook his head and said, “How can humans live to 200-300 years old?”</p><p>“How long do you think those vampires live?” sneered Tang Xiu.</p><p>“Ugh…”</p><p>Tom Reggie was rendered speechless and dumbfounded. He knew that vampires lived for thousands for years, while the most terrifying ones even lived more than that. Yet, can human beings really live that long?</p><p>Suddenly, with slight impatience in his voice, Tang Xiu said, “I need your answer now. Be it your acceptance or refusal, I want it now.”</p><p>“Tang… Boss, do you think any option to refuse still remains?” asked Tom Reggie with a hollow smile.</p><p>“Since you don’t refuse, it’s settled then.” Tang Xiu nodded in satisfaction. “You’re my man starting today, and I’ll send someone to teach you a cultivation technique once I’m done dealing with the problem in Nine Dragons Island. I give you my word that your combat prowess will increase several folds in just three years.”</p><p>“Umm.”</p><p>Tom Reggie nodded without any words. He had already chosen to submit to Tang Xiu, so all the ideas he had in mind changed as well. He thought that becoming Tang Xiu’s subordinate was not shameful since even the terrifying world’s first assassin, Spectre, had become Tang Xiu’s underling as well.</p><p>“There’s another thing I want you to remember, Tom,” warned Tang Xiu. “I want you to maintain absolute respect in front of Uncle Song. Also, should there be any conflicts between him and your former backer, you must stand on his side. You’re also to obey all his commands even when I’m not in Saipan.”</p><p>“This…” Tom Reggie shot a look at Song Guanghui first before nodding and complying, “I’ll follow your order.”</p><p>Song Guanghui squinted and slowly spoke, “I’m very glad to have you join us, Tom. I do. But I can tell that you’re not that willing to submit to Tang Xiu, so I warn you now to stick to your word. You already promised him, so if you don’t follow through, I’ll get rid of you with everything I have even if I have to break the agreement with Dawes.”</p><p>Tom Reggie didn’t flinch at all and bluntly said, “Even Awen and Spectre have already submitted to Mr. Tang. It shows that Mr. Tang’s power is much more terrible than I ever imagined. I’m a bit reluctant—that I admit. But since I’ve made my choice, you can be sure that I’ll take my place appropriately.”</p><p>“You are not that willing to submit, eh?” asked Tang Xiu with a mischievous smile.</p><p>“I am,” replied Tom Reggie without trying to conceal it.</p><p>Tang Xiu’s figure flashed like a shadow and instantly disappeared from the sofa. In just a millisecond, he was already standing in front of Tom Reggie. He pulled him up from the sofa and directly stuffed a pill into his mouth as he shouted aloud, “Relax your body and sense the flow of energy inside your system. Endure the pain. Even if you feel like your body is being sheared, endure it and try your best to sense the energy!”</p><p>With that said, a torrent of Primal Chaos energy crazily rushed into Tom Reggie’s body and began to circulate according to a Nascent Soul cultivation technique route.</p><p>“Damn… it’s painful…”</p><p>Tom Reggie screamed as his body violently shivered.</p><p>Tang Xiu ignored him and just controlled his Primal Chaos energy to circulate faster and open up the clogged acupoints and meridians. After breaking through his meridians, he quickly repaired and nourished them. In just ten minutes, Tang Xiu had broken through 36 of the blocked acupoints in his body, and circulated the energy according to the Small Heavenly Circuit foundation of the cultivation technique and completed the openings to form a full circulation cycle.</p><p>“Uh, something stinky came out?”</p><p>Everyone inside the living room could smell the putrid stench from Tom Reggie’s body.</p><p>Tang Xiu released the man’s body and then threw him on the sofa. He watched him pant and gasp for breath with the clothes on his body drenched in his own sweat. He threw him a smile and said, “Go have a bath in the bathroom downstairs. Tell one of your men to send you a new set of clothes. You have half an hour; I’ll be waiting for you here.”</p><p>While trembling, Tom Reggie replied with a slightly hoarse and shivering voice, “I… have no strength. It’s so damn painful, like having my flesh being sheared by knives.”</p><p>“Trust me. You’ll no longer feel that pain again in a few minutes. It will instead be replaced by a very comfy feeling, like you’re in seventh heaven.” Tang Xiu let out a faint smile and said, “Alright, go! I don’t have much time and can’t afford to delay more. I want you to appear in front of me half an hour from now.”</p><p>‘Goddammit, bastard!’</p><p>Tom Reggie cursed inwardly and struggled to prop himself up as he straggled to the stairs, moving down step by step.</p><p>Song Guanghui, who had been paying full attention to Tang Xiu’s actions and Tom Reggie, asked with a surprised expression on his face after Tom Reggie disappeared down the staircase, “What did you just do, Tang Xiu?”</p><p>“Well, I just helped him open up some of his meridians while also improving his strength at the same time,” said Tang Xiu with a smile. “He has submitted to me, but he’s a bit reluctant, so after he tastes the sweetness of his choice and becomes stronger, his heart will completely give in. Anyway, Uncle Song, Tom Reggie is my gift to you for our first meeting. I hope it’s to your liking.”</p><p>Song Guanghui fell into silence for a short while. Then, he suddenly said, “I need to contact your old man.”</p><p>Tang Xiu extended his hand which was holding his handset and smilingly said, “I already sent you my Dad’s number, so you can call him at any time.”</p><p>Song Guanghui thanked him and got up, gave orders to his men, and then walked into an empty room next door.</p><p>After half an hour, he came out of the room with eyes now full of tenderness when he looked at Tang Xiu. There was also unconcealed excitement on his face.</p><p>“Have you finished talking to my Dad, Uncle Song?” asked Tang Xiu with a smile.</p><p>“Yeah.” Song Guanghui heavily nodded and said, “I learned quite a lot about you from your old man, Tang Xiu. You’re really great—amazing! I just learned that the Magnificent Tang Corp. actually was founded by you, even without the support of the Tang Family. But one thing that I never imagined is that you’re also a cultivator, as are a lot of your men.”</p><p>“Ah, it seems Dad really trusts you given that he even told you about it,” said Tang Xiu smilingly.</p><p>“Whether it’s the present or two decades ago, we’re brothers—life-and-death sworn brothers,” said Song Guanghui straightforwardly. “Be it 20 years later, we’ll still keep off bullets and are willing to die for each other.”</p><p>Tang Xiu raised his thumbs up and praised, “I truly admire that pure brotherhood you’ve shown me, Uncle Song. So, what do you think about the gift I gave you?”</p><p>“It’s great; I like it.” Song Guanghui spiritedly replied, “Tom Reggie is Dawes’s right-hand man, an enemy I used to face with prudence and importance. But now he has become one of my men. I can tell that dealing with Dawes will be much easier with him.”</p><p>“It is said that you’re the number two figure in Saipan, right, Uncle Song?” asked Tang Xiu with a smile. “Do you want to be the definitive Boss here? I can help you achieve it easily if you wish.”</p><p>“Can you do it?” asked Song Guanghui hurriedly.</p><p>“It’s easy to forge a car accident that will claim the number 1 man’s life, don’t you think?” said Tang Xiu with a faint smile. “Or, you can tell Spectre about it. It’s easy for him to get the job done.”</p><p>Sparing a glance at Spectre with a confused face, Song Guanghui said, “His real identity is…”</p><p>“I won’t hide it from you, Uncle Song. He’s Spectre, the best assassin in the world.” Tang Xiu said, “You’re someone with high position and authority, so you should know a lot of things. Don’t tell me you haven’t heard of his name?”</p><p>Spectre? As in, Spectre the number one hitman in the world?</p><p>Song Guanghui’s pupils shrunk and his face turned pale. He heard Spectre name from Tom Reggie previously. He only felt that the man sent out a chilling sensation, yet it never came to his mind to relate him to that dreadful assassin.</p><p>How would he not know of the existence of Spectre? This fella was a notoriously dreadful existence to countless great personages all over the world; even he himself was afraid that this notorious hitman would someday cut his head off while he was sleeping.</p><p>And yet… this guy… how could he become Tang Xiu’s man? How come such a monster like Spectre would submit to others and become someone’s henchman?</p><p>All of sudden, Song Guanghui recalled what his sworn brother just told him on the phone about his son. He felt that Tang Xiu’s father knew too little about his own son.</p><p>“AWESOME!”</p><p>Just as Song Guanghui was still shocked, Tom Reggie ran up the stairs with a flushed, yet intense, excited face. He dashed to Tang Xiu’s front and said aloud, “Tang… Boss, how exactly did you do it? I can feel I’ve become much stronger than I used to be—at least twice of my former strength. Also, my body feels so healthy and comfortable, comfier than any massage I’ve ever had. Yeah, my strength is two times greater. I can feel that I’m at least two times stronger than I used to be!”</p><p>“Your strength absolutely won’t be just twice greater than before after you’ve truly familiarized yourself with it,” said Tang Xiu smile. “Do you believe me now that I have the ability to make you stronger?”</p><p>“Sure hell I do!” exclaimed Tom Reggie excitedly.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
