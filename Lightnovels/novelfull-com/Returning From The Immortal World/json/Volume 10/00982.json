He didn’t cease cultivating as of late, but he hadn’t had much progress after the battle at sea and on the barren island.</p><p>He had been reminded once again by the fact that his power was still weak after tonight. If he was at least twice as strong as he was at the present, he wouldn’t have been at his wits end when Yao Guchun held a remote control and threatened him with detonating the explosives.</p><p>He only possessed a few Demon Stones, while he also hadn’t gotten more of it from his deal with SIngluen so far. Nevertheless, even though the Demon Stone was dwindling, he still took out two more pieces and began to absorb and refine them, rapidly improving his strength.</p><p>As morning came, while Tang Xiu was immersed in his cultivation, he suddenly felt a big tremor as though an earthquake had just begun and his eyes suddenly opened.</p><p>Ring, ring, ring…</p><p>His mobile phone rang.</p><p>Tang Xiu grabbed his cell phone and quickly glanced at the caller on the screen. A smile immediately appeared on his face as he picked it up and said, “Is it done?”</p><p>“It’s been done, Boss.”</p><p>It was Mo Awu’s voice coming out of the phone.</p><p>“Well done,” said Tang Xiu. “I’m waiting for you and the rest to come back, then.”</p><p>After saying that, he directly hung up.</p><p>10 minutes later, Tom Reggie came in a hurry. Upon seeing that Tang Xiu was standing on the second floor’s open balcony facing and looking at the sea in the distance, he immediately shouted, “Something happened, Boss!”</p><p>Tang Xiu creased his brows and his figure floated down. After arriving in front of Tom Reggie, he asked, “What happened?”</p><p>“I just got the news that there was a big explosion in the forested hill in the coastal area here,” said Tom Reggie, “The explosion was so powerful that nearly all of the forest was blown up. I already sent my men to ask around. I heard that the forested hill was originally a Darkwind organization branch in Saipan.”</p><p>“Is that all?” asked Tang Xiu.</p><p>“What do you mean by ‘is that all’, Boss? Is this just a minor matter?” asked Tom Reggie hurriedly. “The Darkwind is the largest intelligence agency in the world and their branch in Saipan has been blown up. With serious casualties, this will definitely shock the world, Boss.”</p><p>“Pipe down, will you?” replied Tang Xiu. “It’s nothing but a small branch of the Darkwind organization in Saipan, no more; what’s the big fuss for? Besides, it was Awu and the rest who did the work.”</p><p>“Ehh? What?!!”</p><p>Tom Reggie was so dumbstruck his jaw went wide as he looked on in disbelief.</p><p>“The Darkwind organization has been monitoring you and Song Guanghai, but you both haven’t found out about it yet,” said Tang Xiu lightly. “I ordered Jin Shi’s team to neutralize all their intelligence personnel around you yesterday, and then I led them to the Darkwind organization branch last night. I just didn’t expect that the Saipan Branch’s Supervisor to be my former personal enemy, though. Hence why I might as well eliminate them directly once for all.”</p><p>Tom Reggie gulped down and his head went blank, unable to express his feelings in words. The news he got mentioned that the big explosion killed at least a hundred people. But such a great disturbance turned out to be the work of the men sent by Tang Xiu?</p><p>‘Damn. He’s a true Grim Reaper!’ whispered Tom Reggie inwardly while looking at Tang Xiu full of awe.</p><p>“Don’t stare at me with that kind of look, will you?” said Tang Xiu smilingly. “All my enemies will meet their makers, while all my friends deserve peace and prosperity. The Darkwind is indeed the world’s largest intelligence agency now, but the agency I’ve established will definitely replace it in the future.”</p><p>“You’ve established your own intelligence agency, Boss?” asked Tom Reggie hurriedly with a shocked face.</p><p>“Of course! If you want your own secret to be contained in the dark while obstructing others to investigate it, then you must become the Lord of the information network yourself,” said Tang Xiu lightly. “Now you realize that following me is a blessing, don’t you? It’s the same for Awu and the others. Not only am I bestowing you with strength, I am giving you opportunities, but you’ll also face much more formidable enemies with me. If you can live to the end, you can also drive yourself to be one of the most powerful men in the world. But if you die earlier, then you can only be recorded in the monument tablet of our organization.”</p><p>Opportunities and challenges were two sides of the same coin, and Tom Reggie also understood this principal truth. He also had his share of opportunities and challenges all these years. He had heard about the existence of dreadful characters, yet none of them could compare to Tang Xiu.</p><p>A man must indeed strive and rely on himself to be strong, for those who are able to stand out from the rest in the world in the future are those who must pave their path through bloodshed and piles of corpses.</p><p>An intense fighting spirit birthed inside Tom Reggie’s heart. He was willing to devote his loyalty to a tough and fierce man like Tang Xiu. With this ambition in his heart, he also perfectly realized that he must follow Tang Xiu if he wanted to become stronger and achieve infinite success.</p><p>“Then I’m devoting my life to you, Boss.”</p><p>“Those who are willing to entrust their life to me are my brothers,” said Tang Xiu with a smile. “Regardless of the countless dangers and crises that I’ll come across along the journey, I’ll try my best to ensure that my brothers stay alive. Keep striving hard since I think highly of you.”</p><p>“Will do!” firmly nodded Tom Reggie with a serious expression.</p><p>Tang Xiu fished out a cigarette, but hadn’t yet taken out a lighter before Tom Reggie quickly reached out with a lighter and ignited it for him.</p><p>“Tom, contact Uncle Song immediately. The big explosion in Saipan will definitely become a good opportunity that we can take advantage of,” said Tang Xiu. “Karst won’t live past tonight, but throwing mud by blaming the explosion on him will depend on your ability to make use of it.”</p><p>Tom Reggie’s complexion turned a bit complicated but he still nodded and said, “Then I’ll get in touch with him right away.”</p><p>He was afraid. It was the dread that blasted into the sky, along with the admiration he had for Tang Xiu inside him. Each of Tang Xiu’s works interlinked with another, leading to other purposes. Some people resorted to schemes and gained success over others, then reaping the benefits to become rich. But Tang Xiu’s machination didn’t stop at the fruition of schemes, but also to obtain more benefits for other purposes while making some others to be a scapegoat.</p><p>While standing in the courtyard, Tang Xiu watched Tom Reggie leave with a satisfied feeling in his heart. He could tell that Tom Reggie had genuinely pledged his allegiance and loyalty to him now.</p><p>The reason why he valued Tom Reggie was because he was aware of his usefulness—usefulness that even exceeded Mo Awu’s. Of course, it was not in martial arts prowess, but in terms of the ability to manage things.</p><p>Mo Awu was very strong, and his ability to kill people was outstanding. But expecting him to achieve achievements like Tom Reggie had, who, by relying on his own ability, commingled in a certain place and formed his own force, was an extremely tall order for him.</p><p>In a way, Mo Awu was a warrior or general, but he couldn’t become a commander-in-chief. Tom Reggie could, on the other hand, could serve both as the general who could charge forward in the battlefield, as well as a natural commander-in-chief who mapped out strategies to lead his own army.</p><p>****</p><p>Under the clear blue sky, a large luxurious yacht slowly stopped cruising on the rippling waves of the sea as melodious laughter spread out from it. On the liner, beauties were serving champagne, good wine, and other delicacies.</p><p>A look of enjoyment and pleasure was plastered on Karst’s face as both of his hands moved. A flirting master like he was, he teased and laughed again and again with more than a dozen belles in bikinis.</p><p>Two stalwart men with cold expressions quietly stayed on guard in the yacht’s cabin. Their expressions never changed in the slightest, even though they were surrounded by several belles in revealing clothes. They were completely ignoring them.</p><p>Ring, ring, ring…</p><p>A mobile phone rang out, and one of the big men took out his cell phone. He looked at his cell phone’s screen before picking up the call and asking, “Something happened?”</p><p>“…”</p><p>Half a minute later, the sturdy men rushed forward and quickly reported to Karst, “Something big just happened, Sir!”</p><p>The smiling face of Karst receded and he fell into silence for a few seconds before motioning the girls to go out. Shortly after, there was only him and the stalwart men in the cabin. As the hatch was closed, he said with a sullen face, “I’ve just gone out for a vacation. Just two days in the last six months for fuck sake! You’ve successfully ruined my mood. You’ll know the result if the content of your report is something trifle.”</p><p>“The news I got said that there was a big explosion in the coastal forested hill of the Morsen area with a death toll of at least a hundred people. More accurately, the specific location of the big explosion is the Darkwind organization branch in Saipan.”</p><p>“WHAT?!”</p><p>Karst jumped up from the sofa all of a sudden with a horrified and stricken look.</p><p>“The news should be true since the cause of the big explosion was a large number of explosives stored in the explosion site,” continued the stalwart man. “The death toll could’ve been greater, up to tens of thousands, if those explosives were placed in the city.”</p><p>Ring, ring, ring…</p><p>As his voice faded away, the cell phone rang again.</p><p>The big man picked up the call once again. He stayed quiet and listened to the report for a while before he hung up and spoke, “I’m afraid you’re in trouble, Sir.”</p><p>“What trouble?” asked Karst in a hurry.</p><p>“News has it that you were not able to tolerate the establishment of the Darkwind organization’s branch in Saipan, so you sent your men to blow it up,” explained the big man. “Also, some people said that you’re going out on vacation in order to avoid suspicion. Shortly speaking, the fact that you’re out on vacation has been spread out.”</p><p>“This is sheer fabrication!” roared Karst furiously. “Someone is framing me and making me the scapegoat!”</p><p>“Be that it may, the troublesome issue is that several dead bodies of your bodyguards have been found in the explosion site,” said the stalwart man. “There are also forged traces of a fight there, so…”</p><p>At this instant, Karst realized the seriousness of the issue. The first thought that came to his mind was his political enemy, Song Guanghui, a man he suspected as the prime culprit who framed him.</p><p>With a seething murderous aura, Karst ordered, “Get in touch with Blanc and Tom Reggie. Someone is conspiring against me, but I won’t sit still and wait for death. If he wants to fight, then I’ll just rip everything and let hell loose!” shouted Karst with a voice that carried his murderous intent.</p><p>“Aah…”</p><p>“God! Is that a man?”</p><p>“Am I dreaming? How is this possible?”</p><p>“…”</p><p>Exclamations and screams from the girls were heard from the outside of the cabin.</p><p>Karst and the stalwart men exchanged glances. The two men suddenly realized something and immediately rushed out of the cabin. When they came to the deck above, the sight that appeared before their eyes was a handsome youth in white attire treading on the water dozens of meters away, walking toward the ship step by step.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
