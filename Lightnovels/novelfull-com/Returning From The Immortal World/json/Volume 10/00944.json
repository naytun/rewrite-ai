Even breathing was so depressing, containing the emotional pain she currently felt. By tiring herself out and spending all her energy on her work, she thought she could probably forget this pain, albeit temporarily.</p><p>Bangkok was a very beautiful place and the night view of the Chao Phraya River was even much more impressive. The sailing liners and buildings that produced the multicolored lights were so beautiful that it looked like a mirage, yet all of those were unable to incite any appreciation of Zhang Xinya, nor were they able to cast away the foul mood she was in.</p><p>“Sis Xinya, please listen to me. Let’s leave and not take any shots here; instead, we’ll pick somewhere else! I have a hunch that hoodlums are going to come back to pick trouble with us again,” urged Zhang Xiaoyu. There was a worried look on her face as she gently squatted before Zhang Xinya with arms crossed.</p><p>“We don’t need to be afraid of him even if he makes a ruckus again, Xiaoyu. Besides, the company has arranged very reliable bodyguards,” lightly replied Zhang Xinya as she looked up.” Besides, haven’t we already reported it to the local police? This is Bangkok; the cops won’t sit idly by doing nothing.”</p><p>“Could you please mature a bit, my lady?” Zhang Xiaoyu forced a wry smile and said, “Bangkok or not, this place is still his turf. People say that the lackeys are even more difficult to deal with than their Boss. Besides, we’re not locals and no matter how powerful a dragon is, it cannot suppress local snakes. We can’t prevent this man in doing anything bad if he’s to make any evil moves.”</p><p>Zhang Xinya fell into silence for a while. But she stubbornly shook her head and said, “Our marketing video shoot has yet to finish. Coming here was difficult, so we can’t give up halfway. No need to persuade me more, Xiaoyu.”</p><p>“You… you’re really… really stubborn like a bull, you know that?” grunted Zhang Xiaoyu helplessly. “Haih, forget it. You wanna stay, then stay! But if we run into dangers again, you must listen to me and leave immediately.”</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Her grunts just earned Zhang Xinya’s plain and dull response, and the face that could bring her a sense of security reappeared again in her mind. A restless, nervous look appeared in her eyes. She couldn’t read the document in her hand anymore and instead moved her eyes to look in the distance.</p><p>“Am I… Am I not seeing things?”</p><p>Her expression froze. She jumped up from the chair and stared towards the distance upon seeing a very handsome man who came closer from afar. Her heart pounded and beat faster.</p><p>“What happened to you, Sis Xinya?” Zhang Xiaoyu was surprised and asked. She also got up and turned to look back.</p><p>Zhang Xinya suddenly closed her eyes. The excitement that was as though a blazing flame inside her was quickly extinguished by a bowl of cold water from her own reminder. She shook her head, sat back on the chair and muttered, “Hallucinations indeed appear if you think too much.”</p><p>Zhang Xiaoyu, who also saw Tang Xiu, immediately looked surprised and hurriedly grabbed Zhang Xinya’s arm and excitedly cried out, “You didn’t hallucinate, Sis Xinya. It’s really… It’s really Mr. Tang. He’s coming here!”</p><p>Opening her eyes again, Zhang Xinya looked again in the direction of Tang Xiu’s arrival. When she saw the face that always appeared in her dreams and reveries, only then did she finally determine that she really didn’t hallucinate. He… he’s really came…</p><p>With both hands in his pockets, Tang Xiu came in front of Zhang Xinya and greeted with a smile, “It’s such a coincidence, isn’t it? You didn’t expect that I’d appear here?”</p><p>Streams of tears came and drilled out of her eyes, sliding down her cheek. It was an unexpected surprise that she was unable to control herself. She dashed a few steps forward and threw herself to hug Tang Xiu, wrapping her hands around him and hugging him very tight.</p><p>Tang Xiu thought that she was afraid due to the accident she encountered here, so he didn’t push her away. He gently patted her shoulder instead and smilingly said, “Don’t worry. I’ve heard about the things that happened to you here. It’s just some ruffian, no less. You don’t have to worry about being harmed since I’m here now.”</p><p>“I miss you!” With eyes bursting with tears, Zhang Xinya said with a sob.</p><p>The statement made Tang Xiu turn stiff at once. He could feel her slightly shivering body in his embrace. He could sense all the emotions coming from the bottom of her heart. Saying that he never had the slightest feeling for Zhang Xinya was absolutely lying to himself. If he had to turn back time and face her like this, he might have accepted her directly. After all, it was very difficult for him to see a woman who loved him so deeply cry and weep in his embrace.</p><p>But then… what about Zhang Xinyue?!</p><p>He was not a man with a single woman anymore. Although he liked Zhang Xinya, there were also some issues relating to Zhang Xinyue. He and she already had skinship, and if he were to give a commitment to Zhang Xinya now, then what about Zhang Xinyue? Should he take these two sisters simultaneously?</p><p>Amid the hugs and sobs, time passed by, and Zhang Xinya was finally able to compose herself and control her emotions. She looked up with teary eyes and asked tremblingly, “You… how… why did you come here?”</p><p>“There was a very important thing I must deal with in Thailand, so I came here,” answered Tang Xiu. “But then Chu Yi called and told me that you’re also in Thailand, and have even run into some problems; hence, I directly came here. But you… you lost weight… a lot of it.”</p><p>Zhang Xinya’s emotions nearly went out of control again. She looked at Tang Xiu with tearful eyes and sobbed with every single word, “I miss you. Whenever I’m eating; whenever I’m doing things; whenever I’m working, and even in my sleep, I always miss you…. Sleeping, eating, everything is sour, everything is so foul since I cannot see you.”</p><p>“I…”</p><p>Tang Xiu’s mouth was opened, but he couldn’t find any word to reply.</p><p>Lifting her hand to trace and press Tang Xiu’s lips gently, Zhang Xinya took a deep breath and said, “Please don’t. Don’t say anything. I’m already very happy just being able to see you. Please, let me be happy for a while. I’m so happy and touched that you worry about my safety, so please let me feel so touched for a while as well…”</p><p>Tang Xiu fell into silence. He could feel her flurried emotions and the pleading that came bursting out of her heart. He suddenly felt how distressed this woman had been, causing him to feel extremely dear toward her. He already had several women at present. Whether it was Kang Xia and Ouyang Lulu or Xue Yu and Mu Wanying, they had also expressed such deep feelings to him. And now, he could clearly feel that Zhang Xinya’s feelings for him was not lesser than theirs—even much deeper.</p><p>Such an unforgettable love, one that had been carved deep into the bones and soul, was something Tang Xiu had experienced himself. It was the love he once had towards Xue Qingcheng in the Immortal World. He once thought that she was his most important significant other, his world, his everything …</p><p>And at this moment, he finally made a decision inside. He gently hugged her, stroking her long beautiful hair with tenderness and said, “Come with me! I need to tell you something.”</p><p>With that said, he looked at Zhang Xiaoyu and said, “Notify them to pause the filming work. I’ll give you 10 minutes to pack up and we’ll leave this place.”</p><p>Zhang Xiaoyu looked excited since she could tell that Tang Xiu actually had such a deep affection toward her sister, Zhang Xinya. When a man loved a woman so dear, that woman was definitely inside that man’s heart.</p><p>“Alright, everyone. Let’s call it a day and go back,” cried out Zhang Xinyue hurriedly.</p><p>At this time, Spectre silently came to Tang Xiu’s side and whispered, “Some people have been around the vicinity and are monitoring this place, Boss. There are two groups of them, one towards our ten o’clock and the other in the direction of four. The first one is just a bunch of street ruffians and have no monitoring instruments, but the last group is quite a pack. Their concealment skill is rather good and they have military-grade equipment.”</p><p>Tang Xiu creased his brows and instantly released his perception to cover the radius of 300 to 400 meters. He found two groups of people just like reported. One group towards their four o’clock was quite particular. The group consisted of two middle-aged men in casual attire looking ordinary. The one that stood out was a man hiding behind an erected billboard, using a hole on the billboard to observe towards their direction.</p><p>“Deal with those at our 10 o’clock and interrogate them. I’ll see those two at our 4 o’clock myself,” ordered Tang Xiu. With that said, he held Zhang Xinya’s hand and left the place.</p><p>At the five-star Amanda Hotel.</p><p>Tang Xiu followed Zhang Xinya to her business suite and watched her make tea. Her smiling face made her look like a blooming flower. She even took out a box of Yellow Crane cigarettes from her bag and handed them to him. Tang Xiu forced a smile and said, “You don’t seem to smoke; how come you carry cigarettes in your bag?”</p><p>She blushed and answered in a low voice, “I know you smoke, so whenever I want to see you, I always imagine lighting your cigarette with my hands.”</p><p>“This…”</p><p>Tang Xiu gaped before he then took out a cigarette and let Zhang Xinya cautiously light it up for him. He took some deep puffs and then walked to the window. While watching the lights outside with his back facing Zhang Xinya, he asked, “Do you really… like me so much?</p><p>The question made Zhang Xinya’s delicate body shudder. But she immediately lifted her head up and walked to Tang Xiu’s side. She spoke without hesitation, “What I feel for you cannot be described as “like”. It’s love. I really love you. So much.”</p><p>Tang Xiu turned around and saw the firm look on her face. He forced out a wry smile and shook his head. “In actuality, I don’t deserve it. I am not a man worthy for you to love, at all. It can even be said that I’m a man who is so fickle in love in the eyes of many people. I have a lot of women already, even too many of them to count. I always refuse you because I can’t give you a happy marriage, for I’m unable to give you my heart wholeheartedly.”</p><p>“I already know that, but I don’t care,” replied Zhang Xinya.</p><p>Again, Tang Xiu forced a smile and said, “There’s also something else, and I dunno how I should tell you. It was a mistake… but… it’s also a very substantial issue…”</p><p>“What issue?” asked Zhang Xinya with a puzzled expression.</p><p>“It’s about me and your sister, Zhang Xinyue,” said Tang Xiu. “We had skinship.”</p><p>“You what?”</p><p>Zhang Xinya’s pupils contracted and her complexion turned ghastly pale. She shot Tang Xiu an incredulous look, pacing backward a few steps with her right hand quickly covering her chest.</p><p>“You… you were…”</p><p>“Sigh… Please don’t misunderstand,” sighed Tang Xiu. “We did have skinship, but it was caused by a special circumstance. Do you still remember when we were in Qingcheng Mountain? I sent someone to escort you back at that time, but Zhang Xinya took your place in attending the villa complex opening ceremony. Something happened at that time…”</p><p>Tang Xiu narrated all the previous incidents to Zhang Xinya and finally said, “I was poisoned, and the poison was very potent. Only a woman was able to help me detoxify it with her body; otherwise, I’d have died. Undoubtedly.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
