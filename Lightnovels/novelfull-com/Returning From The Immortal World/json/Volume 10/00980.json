I’m sure that this organization has found out about our previous private meeting.”</p><p>Song Guanghui’s expression changed to have a bit of dread on his face, saying, “The Darkwind, as in the largest intelligence agency in the world that can infiltrate and spy any entity’s movements all over the world? But why are their eyes set on us?”</p><p>“My guess is because of you and Tom’s identity, Uncle.” Tang Xiu said, “The Darkwind organization’s people have never investigated common folk. You’re the second-in-command figure in Saipan, while Tom can be regarded as weilding a recognizable power aside from his identity as the confidant of the number one figure here. The meeting between you both will naturally attract their attention.”</p><p>“Could it be that geezer Karst found some clues about us because he hired the intelligence personnel of the Darkwind organization to investigate it?” asked Song Guanghui with worry on his face.</p><p>“I don’t rule out this possibility, though the chance is slim,” said Tang Xiu. “I’ve decided to visit the Darkwind organization branch to confirm this issue. Also, please don’t have any meeting with Tom for the time being, Uncle. You can continue doing so after I root out the spies the Darkwind organization planted in Saipan. Also, make a plan to get rid of Karst as soon as possible so you can take over his position as the most powerful man here. It’ll be easier to manage things here later.”</p><p>After all was said and done, Tang Xiu himself had another idea in mind this whole time. It was due to Saipan’s location, a location which made it the closest land to Nine Dragons Island. It could be said that Saipan was a gateway to his island, so Nine Dragons Island’s secret in the future could be safely contained if Saipan was under the control of the people under him. Therefore, it was necessary to push Song Guanghui to the top position of leadership in Saipan. He was ready to take on those who could be in the way to stop it.</p><p>“I’ll work it out with Tom for the operation,” said Song Guanghui. “Since it’s decided that we’ll get rid of Karst, then the best course is doing it without causing suspicion.”</p><p>“It’s a forged accident, then,” said Tang Xiu. “I can assign my men to carry it out if you’re constrained. They can get the job done perfectly. But the following work can only be carried out by yourself.”</p><p>“It’s fine. But be careful on your part,” replied Song Guanghui.</p><p>As dusk came, and after Tang Xiu left Jinla Mansion, Jin Shi, who had been staying hidden, appeared from a dark corner and quickly came to Tang Xiu’s front.</p><p>“Everything’s done?” inquired Tang Xiu.</p><p>“There were three of them, but we’ve dealt with them,” nodded Jin Shi.</p><p>“Since you’ve dealt with them, then let’s head straight to the Darkwind branch here,” said Tang Xiu. “Keep in mind to not let any of them escape, as it would expose us and bring out unnecessary troubles later.”</p><p>“Copy that!” said Jin Shi respectfully.</p><p>The Darkwind organization had been one of the concerns Tang Xiu had in mind. This power was the world’s largest intelligence agency with a terrifying number of intelligence personnel, at least a million, and possibly even more. It was unknown how many terrifying powerful characters were among them.</p><p>He naturally held no fear against the Darkwind organization with the current force possessed by the Everlasting Feast Hall. He believed that he could eliminate most of the top dogs of this organization should he raid their headquarters. But still, weeding out the grass was nearly impossible without culling out its root. He must be prepared to have crazy retaliation from this organization in the future should he fail to completely eradicate this agency. While he didn’t fear them, his friends and family would be dragged into the swamp and experience dangers.</p><p>Other than that, while it was true that individual combat prowess was of paramount importance in this world, there was still another danger stronger than an individual’s strength—modern weapons, such as bombs, missiles, nukes, and some others. A large organization such as the Darkwind surely had its own exclusive armed forces. Should they get desperate and use a dreadful weapon such as a nuclear warhead, even he himself wouldn’t be able to stop them.</p><p>Coastal area.</p><p>In a forested hill of Saipan were several foreign-style villas owned by the Darkwind organization. There, over a hundred armed forces were stationed.</p><p>Inside the villa in the center of the complex, Yao Guchun quietly sat on the sofa. The room was pitch-black, yet his eyes were particularly gleaming and were filled with killing intent.</p><p>On the coffee table in front of him laid three photos: Tang Xiu, Song Guanghui, and Tom Reggie respectively. There was also a mobile phone next to these photos.</p><p>Ring, ring, ring…</p><p>The ringing tone of the phone pulled him back from his daydream as the slightly bright screen barely illuminated the darkroom. Yao Guchun quickly grabbed the phone and pressed the answer button, inquiring in a deep voice, “How was it? Did you get something?”</p><p>“Not yet, but we have found some other things, though.”</p><p>“What did you find?”</p><p>“Tang Xiu just went to Jinla Mansion to visit Sen Hui today. Our men are still monitoring the vicinity of Jinla Mansion, but we have yet to get any news of Tang Xiu leaving.”</p><p>“I see.”</p><p>Yao Guchun then hung up with eyes sparkling. He had long hated Tang Xiu and even wished that he could mutilate him to pieces. He accidentally found Tang Xiu’s figure after the Darkwind’s intelligence personnel had investigated and noticed the contact between Song Guanghui and Tom Reggie.</p><p>Thus, he inferred that there was a secret conspiracy brewing between Song Guanghui and Tom Reggie, with Tang Xiu playing a very important role in the middle. Therefore, he scattered all the Darkwind’s intelligence personnel all over Saipan with the main purpose to investigate the relationship between Tang Xiu, Song Guanghui, and Tom Reggie.</p><p>“If you haven’t found out about it, I think you got assassins hiding here.”</p><p>The room’s light was lit up all of a sudden as Tang Xiu and Tang Guang appeared in front of Yao Guchun. Tang Xiu had even sat across Yao Guchun, legs crossed and sporting a faint smile on his handsome face.</p><p>“You…”</p><p>Yao Guchun abruptly jumped up from the sofa. Outsiders may not know how dreadful Tang Xiu was, but how could he not? For someone who was able to kill the Amur Tiger, saying that the killer was not powerful was an absolute understatement. But still, even if he was indeed very strong, how was he able to appear here before him so silently?</p><p>“Ehh?” Tang Xiu smiled faintly and asked, “Why do you look so shocked?</p><p>While staring at Tang Xiu vigilantly, Yao Guchun asked in a deep voice, “How did you come inside? This place is guarded by a lot of guards and the various monitoring equipment here leave no blind spot at all. There’s no way you can come here without being spotted by my men.”</p><p>“I think you overestimate your men too highly.” Tang Xiu smiled and said, “They are all just a bunch of trash to me. Just the thought that they can track me is already a ridiculous notion. Alright, let’s spare the chit-chat, shall we? As I see it, you seem to have a photo of mine on this coffee table.”</p><p>This made Yao Guchun’s complexion change, but he narrowed his eyes and said, “I don’t think you’re unaware of my identity since you came here, Tang Xiu. That’s right. I’m the Branch Supervisor of the Darkwind office in Saipan. Now tell me what your purpose is in coming here!”</p><p>“Purpose?” Tang Xiu lightly smiled. “My purpose is simple. I want to get information from you, no less!”</p><p>Feeling slightly relaxed inwardly, Yao Guchun asked with a deep voice, “Then what information do you wanna buy? The Darkwind’s objective is always clear. So long as the price is right, you can get even the sleeping posture of the U.S. President should you want it.”</p><p>Tang Xiu lit up a cigarette and waved. “Spare me the U.S. President’s sleeping posture. What interests me is you. Accurately speaking, it’s your Darkwind organization that interests me.”</p><p>“I don’t get you.” Yao Guchun knitted his brows.</p><p>“Playing a fool, huh?” Tang Xiu sneered. “If you don’t get it, then let me rephrase. Why has your Darkwind agency been digging up info about me, as well as Song Guanghui and Tom Reggie? What’s your purpose in sending your men to secretly monitor Song Guanghui and Tom Reggie?”</p><p>Yao Guchun was silent for a while and then answered, “That’s my job here. Song Guanghui and Tom Reggie’s identities are not ordinary. There is a high chance that someone will buy information about them. I naturally won’t miss any intel that can fetch a fortune.”</p><p>“How insightful you are. You also got some shrewd business acumen in you, eh?” Tang Xiu gave a thumbs up and praised. “Well, if it weren’t for my visit tonight, I’m afraid you could have been promoted to a higher position in the Darkwind organization in the future.”</p><p>“I accept your compliment,” said Yao Guchun. “Just tell me what kind of intel you need if you’re coming to buy information. But if you’ve come to make trouble, I have many men here that will make you pay much more than you can even imagine, even if you’re strong enough that even the Amur Tiger is not your match.”</p><p>“Wow! I like those words of yours.” Tang Xiu clapped and happily said, “Well, it seems that I must do something to prove you wrong, though.”</p><p>“What are you trying to do?” responded Yao Guchun quickly.</p><p>“Jin Shi, do it,” said Tang Xiu with a smile.</p><p>“Tang Xiu, there’s no enmity between the Darkwind and you!” Yao Guchun’s face greatly changed as he shouted, “We did investigate some information about you, but why do you want to kill us? Don’t tell me you’re not afraid to be a mortal enemy of my Darkwind organization?”</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>Tang Guang flashed and instantly appeared in front of him. He grabbed his neck and lifted him from the floor, sneering, “Heh. Do you fucking think my Boss would care about being your Darkwind organization’s enemy? What shit is your Darkwind, huh? Should my Boss will it so, he’s fully capable of completely destroying your organization!”</p><p>“Well, don’t scare this guy, Guang.” Tang Xiu smiled and said, “If you scare him to death, I won’t be able to squeeze some valuable info from him.”</p><p>Tang Guang nodded slightly and threw Yao Guchun to the floor and flashed back to stand behind Tang Xiu.</p><p>“So, what’s your name?” asked Tang Xiu with a smile.</p><p>“Guchun,” answered Yao Guchun after being silent for a while.</p><p>“Guchun is just your name. What I wanna know is your surname.” Tang Xiu rolled his eyes and mocked him. “Don’t try acting like a smartass. I can find your Darkwind organization’s branch, so I can naturally find the name of who’s in charge of the branch here. You’ve just confirmed now that my suspicion about you is correct; isn’t that right, Mr. Yao?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
