One thing he found out that made him dread Tang Xiu was his background—the Tang Family of Beijing in China. The intel he had obtained even indicated that Tang Xiu was someone responsible for the death of the Amur Tiger.</p><p>He knew who the Amur Tiger was as he had once visited this man. Although this man was not exactly a very powerful rival nor subordinate, his actual strength was nothing to scoff at either.</p><p>Thus, after he found out that Tang Xiu’s purpose was the zodiac jade carving, he didn’t hesitate to take it out. He even offered another precious mineral in his collection to him, intending to bury the hatchet that was against him.</p><p>“Just? Just what?” asked Singkuo with a smile, still training his eyes on Tang Xiu.</p><p>“It’s just that I have a commitment that I will definitely keep,” said Tang Xiu indifferently. “You have a lot of men with you now, so you have two options: you can either remove me immediately, or you can face a dead-end when I come back here after I’m done dealing with some other issues.”</p><p>With a complexion turned slightly solemn after hearing that, the smile on Singkuo’s face disappeared. He shot a deep look at Tang Xiu and asked, “So we can’t see this eye to eye then? Even though I have respectfully presented you the jade pig you’ve been wanting, as well as a precious mineral I’ve kept for many years as a gift?”</p><p>Tang Xiu pondered for a while and then slowly said, “I’ll accept the jade pig and the Flame Crystal. In exchange, I’ll give you some time to make preparations. Your Dark Shaman clan has two heirs—I only want to see a sole heir once I come back. It doesn’t matter who it is.”</p><p>Singkuo seemed to be moved and asked again, “What if that sole heir is me? Can we still get along in the future?”</p><p>“Not only will we have peace, but we can also cooperate in some aspects.” Tang Xiu nodded.</p><p>‘A cooperation, huh?’</p><p>Singkuo sneered inwardly. He hadn’t yet found out all the details about Tang Xiu at present, and he didn’t want to rashly act. He was now finally certain that Tang Xiu’s commitment to helping his foolish little brother would involve some conditions that would damage his own interests. It was likely that these conditions would include some considerable losses to his Dark Shaman clan.</p><p>10 minutes later, Tang Xiu was sitting in the first-class cabin on the plane. He immediately took his mobile out and dialed a cell number. After the call got picked up, he spoke, “Xiaoxue, immediately send 20 members of our Everlasting Feast Hall at the Foundation Establishment Stage to Bangkok. They are to find Singluen and protect his safety. Put Light and Dark in charge of the team if they are free from their assignment!”</p><p>“Understood, Grand Master,” answered Gu Xiaoxue.</p><p>After pondering for a short while, Tang Xiu said again, “Also, prepare 50 Essence Amassing Pills. Tell Light and Dark to give them to Singluen as an up-front payment. Tell the man to race against time to enhance the strength of every expert under him. Also, there’s a traitor around him—someone who’s very close to him. Tell him to discover and neutralize the spy.”</p><p>“Alright, I’ll pass your message to him.”</p><p>As the call ended and after he had put away the handset into his interspatial ring, coldness gleamed inside Tang Xiu’s eyes. He admitted that Singkuo was a more outstanding option compared to Singluen—a level higher in excellence. Yet this man had a deep scheming mind, a type of person he never liked getting along with. If he wanted to obtain the Demon Stone from the Dark Shaman clan and gradually make this clan under his control and work for him in the future, Singluen was the best candidate.</p><p>Hence, there was no better option left other than Singkuo’s death, including his father’s demise—the current Patriarch of the Dark Shaman clan. At that time, it would be much easier for him to control Singluen.</p><p>Outside the airport.</p><p>Singkuo got into a limousine and, as the car started up, he spoke to the confidant next to him, “Call our contact in China and tell them to investigate this Tang punk. I want a complete and thorough investigation. Also, get into contact with the intel leader of the Darkwind organization in China to purchase any intel regarding Tang Xiu.”</p><p>“Understood.”</p><p>The middle-aged man with a goatee and a short braided hairdo complied and made some phone calls. However, his complexion turned a bit dazed after he made his last phone call. He then shook his head and said, “Young Master, I just called the head of intel for the Darkwind Organization in China. We’ve got some bad news.”</p><p>“What is it?” asked Singkuo with a deep voice.</p><p>“He told me that they have a lot of information about Tang Xiu, but none of it is substantive information. The Darkwind have been able to get all the information about Tang Xiu that any other organization could get, but they, just like many others, have been unable to dig up any other substantial information either. Also, he told me something else—that a lot of dreadful figures are likely to be around Tang Xiu at all times. The Darkwind have lost tens of elite intel agents that have investigated the details of him; thus, they have been unable to find anything substantial regarding his core secrets.”</p><p>Singkuo’s expression changed. He knew perfectly well what the Darkwind organization was truly capable of. It was the biggest intelligence organization in the world and an existence that was absolutely able to investigate everything through every opening. It was to the extent that they could even investigate the color of the underwear the President of the United States wore today if they wanted to. Yet, why have they been unable to investigate any meaningful information about Tang Xiu at all?</p><p>There are two possibilities regarding this issue:</p><p>Firstly, there is a very formidable character who’s always around Tang Xiu and possesses a very formidable counter-detection ability. Even though there’s no other card in Tang Xiu’s hand, this character is responsible for ruining all the investigations conducted by the Darkwind organization.</p><p>Secondly, there’s another powerful entity behind Tang Xiu, causing even the Darkwind organization to be unable to investigate the existence of that power.</p><p>Singkuo suddenly felt a bad premonition. No matter which possibility it was, it only meant that Tang Xiu was not simple. Therefore, if he didn’t want to be his enemy, then he must completely resolve all the enmities between them, including any possible future conflicts. Only then would he be able to remove his younger brother.</p><p>“I originally planned to let this little brother bastard of mine live for a few more years. I didn’t expect that he’d act first to remove me. Since this is the case, I can’t be blamed for being ruthless and throwing away all the kinship between us.”</p><p>****</p><p>The hazy night was filled with the occasional breeze from the sea. Tang Xiu took Zhang Xinya, Spectre, Gu Tao, and Zhang Jue to board a taxi that took them to traverse the coastal highway of Saipan. Under the dim light of the street, Zhang Xinya looked like a kitten that was shrunk in Tang Xiu’s arms fast asleep, whereas Spectre sitting shotgun wore a bored expression and watched the night outside the window.</p><p>“There’s police blockade. The road ahead is closed, Sir.”</p><p>The taxi driver suddenly turned his head and reported.</p><p>“It’s past 3 AM; why would the police close the road at this hour?” Tang Xiu frowned and asked, “Also, this is not the only road to the Lao Bay Resort, right? Can we take a roundabout route?”</p><p>“I dunno why the police have blockaded this road,” said the taxi driver, “However, this road is the nearest path to the Lao Bay Resort. It would take us more than 30 minutes to make a detour.”</p><p>“For now, drive over there and inquire as to what happened and why they have closed the road ahead,” said Tang Xiu.</p><p>“Okay!”</p><p>The taxi driver complied. He picked up the speed again and quickly moved ahead. When the taxi stopped at the front of the four police cars, the cab driver opened the window and asked aloud, “Hey, police officers, why is this road closed off? I’m driving my passengers to the Lao Bay Resort through here.”</p><p>“Please get out of your car for inspection.”</p><p>The middle-aged policeman strode over and waved the baton in his hand.</p><p>“This…” The cab driver hesitated and turned to look at Tang Xiu.</p><p>Tang Xiu turned to Spectre and ordered, “Tell him that I’m a friend of Tom Reggie.”</p><p>Spectre nodded and called out to the policeman outside, “Hey, our Boss is a friend of Tom Reggie, so I hope you can make way for us. Besides, my boss is very tired now and needs a rest. You can expect some miserable repercussions if you affect my Boss’s trip here.”</p><p>Tom Reggie’s friend?</p><p>The policeman’s expression changed. As he was about to report this to his leader, a few headlights came from the distance and three black SUVs parked near the taxi shortly after.</p><p>“Hey, what happened here?” a big man in the frontmost car came out and shouted loudly.</p><p>Upon seeing the license plates of the SUVs, the policeman’s complexion changed yet again. He stood straight to give a salute and answered with a respectful face, “Honored Sir, we’re setting up a roadblock here to chase two criminals who committed murder two days ago. Please forgive us if this affects you.”</p><p>“Hurry up and make way.”</p><p>That policeman immediately shouted a few times and two police cars moved to the roadside to make way. The burly man then went back to the SUV as the three SUVs restarted their engines and moved ahead.</p><p>Tang Xiu was still sitting in the taxi as he saw Spectre striding to block the path of the three SUVs with cold light gleaming in his eyes. He had already guessed that the people in these three SUVs were people of power in Saipan.</p><p>“What the hell are you doing?”</p><p>The stalwart man poked his head out of the window and shouted at Spectre.</p><p>Spectre ignored him and looked at the police instead and asked aloud, “Why the hell can they pass through but we can’t? Do they have some privileges here or something?”</p><p>“You fucking bastard!”</p><p>Several policemen rushed over to try to drive Spectre away.</p><p>Tang Xiu released his perception to inside the SUVs and looked surprised after he saw more than ten people sitting inside them. It was because he found a familiar face inside, someone he knew through his father.</p><p>He gently pushed Zhang Xinya away and made her lean on the seat to continue her sleep. He then opened the car’s door to get out and headed to the front of Spectre. While pointing at the policemen who rushed over to them, he let out a smile and spoke in Mandarin, “I believe in fate; may I know if Mr. Song believes in it too?”</p><p>A belief in fate?</p><p>Inside the second SUV, Song Guanghui, who had just awoken from his sleep due to the stop, suddenly heard the voice outside. Surprise flashed in his eyes as he opened the window to look outside with a puzzled expression on his face.</p><p>A young man… and an outsider, too?</p><p>He thought for a moment and asked, “Young man, are you from China—and do we know each other?”</p><p>Tang Xiu paced forward to the SUV, but was stopped by five burly men who rushed out of the car. Several policemen even quickly drew their pistols, aiming their muzzles at him.</p><p>Looking at this scene, Tang Xiu only shook his head and smilingly said, “I heard my father say that Uncle Song is a senior official of Saipan. It seems like it’s really true.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
