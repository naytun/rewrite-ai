We are cultivators—seekers of the Great Dao who never wantonly kill innocents. We’ll never shy away from erasing you should you dare to bring the fight to us!”</p><p>The black-robed old man no longer spoke. He quickly bit his finger and drew a row of exquisite blood-colored runes in the air, then fiercely pointed his staff towards Daoist Zixuan.</p><p>A raging black fog suddenly blasted out of nowhere. As the blood runes began to disperse, countless interconnected blood threads began spreading out. They all seemed to have a life of their own and gradually turned into a sketch of a domain made of black fog.</p><p>“Tenebrous Domain!”</p><p>A dazzling beam suddenly blasted out from the gem inlaid in the staff in the black-robed man’s hand. Gorgeous scarlet blood threads pervaded the black fog, forming a skull with bloody eyes. At the same time, countless smaller skulls stacked atop each other and ultimately formed a humanoid skeleton warrior.</p><p>This made Daoist Zixuan’s complexion greatly changed since she knew a bit about the Celestial Wizard clan. Those from this clan who were able to cast Tenebrous Domain were the strongest among them.</p><p>“You wish to fight? Then a battle you’ll have!”</p><p>Daoist Zixuan streaked into the sky. The black fog was highly viscous with a pungent stench, yet she was able to instantly create a clean passage and flashed several hundreds of meters upward into the sky. There, she shouted, “Never once have I, Daoist Zixuan, ever killed insignificant cretin. For being able to cast Tenebrous Domain, your distinguished self must be a top expert among the Celestial Wizard clan, right? Then bring it on! Let’s see who’s stronger between us!”</p><p>“Wizard of Origin, Blask Soloch!”</p><p>The black-robed old man’s mouth only opened slightly, yet his voice was as though the sound of a raging sea that rapidly cruised its way toward Daoist Zixuan. The skeleton monster made of black fog followed by formed a bone whip in its hand and aggressively hurled itself toward Daoist Zixuan.</p><p>“Ocean of Swords!”</p><p>Daoist Zixuan instantly unleashed the sheathed longsword on her back. Its blade multiplied by two, to four, to sixteen… and, in just less than half a second, turned into thousands of sword blade shadows, truly representing its name as a turbulent ocean wave made of swords. The roaring tide of swords turned into overlapping layers made of swords that stirred the black fog in the sky and stormed over toward the skeleton monster.</p><p>On the 9th barren island.</p><p>-As the ten helicopters stayed still in the air several meters above the land, shadowy figures flew out from the helicopters’ cabins and landed on the coast. Cui Jian, who had long been waiting on the island, immediately put the laptop down and swiftly sprinted to greet Tang Xiu. He then saluted and reported, “Cui Jian is reporting, Boss!”</p><p>“What’s the current situation?” asked Tang Xiu.</p><p>“The Whole Unitary Sect’s ship has run into the Celestial Wizard’s and they are now engaging in combat,” reported Cui Jian. “You can watch their battle on the laptop there, Boss.”</p><p>Tang Xiu then came to the front of the laptop. When his eyes fell on the laptop screen, he happened to see the scene when Daoist Zixuan’s sword clashed with the black fog.</p><p>“She deserves to be called a Golden Core Stage expert with such powerful striking power. But the technique of that Celestial Wizard clan’s expert somehow looks like the ghost cultivation system’s one. Anyway, Cui Jian. How far are they from this island?”</p><p>“About 26 nautical miles, Boss!” answered Cui Jian.</p><p>Tang Xiu narrowed his eyes before he turned around to look at the 48 Foundation Establishment experts who had neatly stood by in rows. Then he issued an order in a deep voice, “You are to stay here and are not to move without my orders. Chimei, Awu. You both come with me to observe the battle.”</p><p>“There’s a speedboat nearby, Boss,” interjected Cui Jian quickly. “I’ll tell the men to take it there.”</p><p>“No need for that.” Tang Xiu waved his hand and said, “Let’s set off, Chimei!”</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>As Ji Chimei replied, a stream of qi instantly wrapped Tang Xiu and Mo Awu, and all of them quickly flashed into the distance. With her power, Ji Chimei had already pinpointed the location of the fight easily with her spiritual sense. In just a few seconds, the three of them had arrived more than 20 miles away from their prior location.</p><p>However, Tang Xiu wanted to see the ability showcased by the Whole Unitary Sect’s people first, so he ordered Ji Chimei to stay a few kilometers away and used binoculars to observe the battle.</p><p>“They are very strong, Boss. At least a lot stronger than me.” Mo Awu, who stood beside Tang Xiu, spoke with a solemn face.</p><p>Tang Xiu shot him a glance and lightly said, “Daoist Zixuan is an expert at the Golden Core Stage, so of course she’s much more powerful than you. But her striking power and technique don’t show it. She’s either hiding her power intentionally, or she has shallow combat experience. That wizard is weaker than her, but he obviously has richer combat experience. Although he’s controlling the attacks of that skeleton monster, he still looks relaxed. But…”</p><p>“But what, Boss?” Mo Awu looked at him with a slightly changed expression.</p><p>“It’s just like I said previously. Even if he has rich combat experience, his cultivation is still not Daoist Zixuan’s match. He’s at least able to fare well for several minutes, but he’s on the losing side and will die.”</p><p>A few kilometers away from them, the overlapping layers of sword images were as though waves hammering the shore as they kept smashing the skeleton monster, forcing it to keep retreating. No matter how powerful the bone whip was, it was practically unable to fend off the ocean of swords, and was far from being a threat to Daoist Zixuan at all. The skeleton made of black fog and its bone whip kept collapsing while its attacking power was getting weaker every second.</p><p>“Fucking bitch!”</p><p>The black-robed old man’s face turned more savage. Two streams of black fog suddenly wrapped around his legs and instantly propelled him up, carrying him onto the skeleton monster’s left shoulder. He then used a sharp black stiletto to cut his own fingers, causing his blood to immediately drop down and be absorbed by the skeleton’s body.</p><p>BUZZ…</p><p>A billowing aura erupted from the skeleton monster, while the endless black fog around it formed a large number of black skulls which quickly merged into the monster. In just a few seconds, the size of the skeleton monstrosity nearly doubled and the bone whip grew bigger, bringing more explosive power.</p><p>“BREAK!!!”</p><p>Green veins protruded and pulsed on Blask Soloch’s forehead as he fiercely waved his hands. The skeleton monster was as though imitating his movements and swiftly swung its arms as well. The tens of meters long bone whip flogged out, bringing with it roaring gales as it frantically clashed with the overlapping layers of the ocean of swords.</p><p>BOOM, BOOM…</p><p>The ocean of swords seemed to be divided, forming an opening amid its wake. Countless sounds of the explosion shortly followed, but the bone whip’s momentum seemed unstoppable as it crushed the overlapping layers of the sword sea. In just the blink of an eye, it already appeared hundreds of meters away right before Daoist Zixuan’s eyes.</p><p>Even while facing such a predicament, only disdain and contempt were present in Daoist Zixuan’s eyes. A chilling voice then came out of her mouth, “Hmph, just this bit of skill? You’ll face your defeat today if this is the best you can do!”</p><p>The sword images that looked like they were being defeated eventually turned into a longsword, dancing and hovering around her. Quickly, it began absorbing the Heaven and Earth energy in the surrounding area frantically. Although the world energy in the surroundings was very thin, the rapid rotation of the sword sent out a blazing radiance as if a blazing and scorching sun was sending out its brilliant rays amid the darkness.</p><p>“Swords of Blazing Sun—Infinite Beams!”</p><p>The moment Daoist Zixuan’s voice came out, countless sword beams unceasingly burst from the blazing sun, shooting at the skeleton monstrosity.</p><p>Each sword blade was tens of meters long, and now seemingly formed a long sword chain in the sky. Thousands of sword images slashed down, while the impact force shattered the bone whip in the skeleton monster’s hand. The rainbow-like sword beams didn’t stop and unceasingly striking forward, shattering the skeleton’s arm and tearing its body. In just a short few breaths, both the skeleton monster’s arms were shattered and a few wide holes were present in its chest.</p><p>“BE CAREFUL!!!”</p><p>Two black shadows suddenly streaked upward from the two ships belonging to the Celestial Wizard clan like two lightning bolts. As the two people bit the tip of their tongue, they each spew out a blood fog, which quickly flashed and appeared in the dense black mist. While each holding their own staff, the two men unleashed their magic power to form a black globe shield around them.</p><p>Crack!!!</p><p>The skeleton monster was finally crushed by the sword blades and the countless others now slashed down to crush the black shield down. A series of cracks began to appear on the black shield, while the two black-robed old men cast incantation as two giant axes then formed over the shield!</p><p>“Slash!”</p><p>The two old men shouted at the same time, causing the two humongous axes to quickly merge into one. With an irresistible force, it crashed down to greet the sword beams head-on. At this moment, the paled Blask Soloch, looking particularly dire, suddenly took out a silver needle more than 10cm long and fiercely pierced his own heart. At the moment he pulled it out, a stream of blood jetted out from his chest. Right as the blood mist touched the surrounding black fog, a dreadful black flame blazed out with a terrifying heatwave, boiling the seawater underneath and causing the death of countless fish and shrimp, covering the ocean with their dead bodies.</p><p>“Sanguine Hex!”</p><p>A look of madness was gleaming in Blask Soloch’s eyes. The moment the black flame fused into the obsidian giant ax, the ax’s size became hundreds of meters in size. With its striking might increasing its strength several times, it moved down to crush the sword blade in front, shattering them like splitting bamboo as it blasted its path forward with irresistible force towards Daoist Zixuan.</p><p>“Shit!”</p><p>Daoist Zixuan shouted a curse, and her figure instantly streaked up much higher into the sky. Although the Tenebrous Domain in the surroundings obstructed her, she was still able to dash away a kilometer higher in the sky in an instant, freeing herself from the shrouding of the black fog. In the next moment, her longsword also followed lightning-fast back to her hand.</p><p>However, the sword that used to look brilliant with flickering cold light, now had a visible crack on its blade, while the corrosive black fog continued to linger around it.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
