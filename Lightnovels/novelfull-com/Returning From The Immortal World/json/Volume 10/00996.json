He had gradually learned Tang Xiu’s character during the contact he had with him. He was well aware that Tang Xiu helping would be very unlikely in the future no matter how hard he tried if he didn’t kill Singkuo now.</p><p>‘What should I do? Kill or not?’</p><p>Tang Xiu floated down to his side and said indifferently, “I still remember that your ultimate goal is not just killing your big brother, Singluen. You’re bound to kill those who go up against you should you want to claim the Patriarch seat of your clan and take over the clan’s power. Just remember, petty kindness will end up bringing you endless troubles in the future.”</p><p>After this reminder, Singluen’s face slightly changed. He shot Tang Xiu a deep gaze and then raised the saber in his hand, loudly shouting, “Everyone, heed my order! Singkuo must die today. Kill whoever dares to intervene without mercy!”</p><p>The declaration made Singli’s face drastically change. He glared at Tang Xiu first before yelling, “Knock it off, Singluen. Is this not enough already? Don’t tell me you’ll also kill your father for your ultimate goal? You’ve won today; the Patriarch seat is bound to be yours. Why do you still want to kill your brother and your own clansmen?”</p><p>“There’s no way I’d kill my father. I know he’s always good to me, but age has come to him and he rarely has time to manage the clan’s affairs after cultivating. It’s a much better idea for me to replace him, as he can’t fulfill his responsibility. As for Singkuo… hmph… He and I have come to the point of no return. Do you think he’d just behave and won’t try anything against me in the future after I let him go today? Get the fuck out of my way, lest you’ll die with him.”</p><p>A smile crept up on Singli’s face despite the extreme anger he had. He then shouted, “Then we might as well help your big brother since you’re so stubborn and are so adamant in killing him. 13 Shaman Guardians! Protect Singkuo and return! The three of you, the situation has come to this point; do you think you still have any chance of leaving this place alive?”</p><p>Singkuo’s three guardian elders exchanged dismayed glances. They understood the meaning of Singli’s words. A sorrowful smile appeared on their faces and the trio gathered in the blink of an eye. Their figures then flashed upward and overlapping black flames emerged around them.</p><p>One of them then shot a deep stare at Tang Xiu and shouted in a clear voice, “Young man from China, you have formidable power and you’re also a very powerful cultivator among your kind. You just broke the Darkness Forbidden Art cast by my brother, but can you stop this forbidden art cast by the three of us?”</p><p>“Really, seriously?” sneered Tang Xiu with his hands crossed behind his back. “Are you sure the three of you can join hands and put it to use?”</p><p>Puff…</p><p>The air around the guardian elder was as though distorted, and a black figure appeared behind him in that instant. At the same time, a sword pierced his heart and slashed the muscles, bones, and meridians to the left of his chest. The glittering cold and sharp sword then continued to chop off his left arm.</p><p>“Let us deal with these three buffoons, Grand Master!”</p><p>Tang Guang flew up into the sky. His white robe rustled in the air and, in almost an instant, he joined Tang An to form a sword array. Images of swords flickered and swept the black flame as it trapped the two guardian elders within.</p><p>A smile appeared on Tang Xiu’s face. He retracted back his eyes from them, shifting them to Singli, stating apathetically, “Well, I think you’re the only one who can cast the Darkness Forbidden Art now. It makes me curious, though; can you really rescue Singkuo? If anything, I am even more curious whether my men have what it takes to kill all their prey.”</p><p>At his statement, Mo Awu laughed aloud as he and Jin Shi’s team of ten flashed and instantly appeared around the black mist, forming the Decagonal Heaven Extinguisher Sword Array. He then laughed and said, “They are nothing but ants, Boss. But I’m afraid you have to deal with that Singli geezer personally.”</p><p>Singluen paced two steps forward and said in a deep voice, “No. There’s no need for Mr. Tang to act. I’ve long been wanting to see the ability of the second strongest expert of my Dark Shaman clan. Five guardian elders, I need your assistance to kill him here.”</p><p>At this time, only then did Singli feel an intense feeling of crisis looming over him. He just observed Singluen and his five guardian elders and was aware that they must not be underestimated. It was likely that he wouldn’t be able to face the six of them together. Further, there was also Tang Xiu—a fearful man whose eyes kept staring at him, making him feel dread.</p><p>Inside the black mist and while protected by 13 Shaman Guardians, Singkuo’s expression was ghastly pale as he appeared lifeless. He knew that he had lost. It was a complete defeat, and even if he had a chance to make a comeback in the future, he would likely be unable to contend with Singluen anymore.</p><p>He may have had the chance to fight Singluen’s side if his five guardian elders were still alive. But now, the chance was as sure as gone already.</p><p>Cough, cough…</p><p>He coughed severely a few times and slowly closed his eyes. But after a few seconds, he immediately opened them again and shouted in a heavy voice, “I admit your victory, Singluen. I’ll leave Thailand and will never go back again to this land forever.”</p><p>“Seriously, dear brother? You’ve been a very smart man before, but why have you become so muddleheaded today?” mocked Singluen. “Do you think I’ll just let a tiger run back to the mountain to give me endless troubles in the future? Your promise is nothing but bullshit in my eyes.”</p><p>“Do you really want to spare none of us here?” shouted Singkuo angrily. “You even want to take over father’s position?”</p><p>“Che, the Dark Shaman Clan has been silent for too long. What era are we living in now?” said Singluen coldly. “It’s better to move forward, else you’ll fall behind if you wish to live better in this era. Let alone a small Dark Shaman clan, I will also take a chance to face the Celestial Wizard Clan in the future!”</p><p>A billowing aura flowed out of Singkuo’s body. He raised his hand and crossed the black crescent machete in front of his chest, saying in a heavy voice, “If that’s the case, then let’s get it over with! As long as I’m not dead today, I’ll forever haunt you until I kill you!”</p><p>At his declaration, Singluen’s expression turned more solemn, and he ferociously roared, “No more useless talk. KILL!”</p><p>The mortal combat unfolded again. It much more intense than before, causing the buildings in the coconut plantation to collapse, destroying the coconut trees and throwing their leaves everywhere. It was like the advent of the apocalypse. A lot of birds flapped their wings as they passed by the scene, but ultimately met their unfortunate end after being shattered by the clashes of sweeping sword energy, as well as the black mist that filled the air.</p><p>Atop the water tower in the distance, Zuo Daquan’s lips twitched as he looked helpless and dismayed. It was a calamity caused by others, but as a bystander he still had to bear the brunt. The cost was too big for him to bear. The nest he had been operating for more than a decade now actually became the battlefield for outsiders and was eventually destroyed.</p><p>“Boss…” called out a middle-aged man in a whisper with a dismayed scowl on his face.</p><p>“Say no more. It’s the price for the mistake I made.” Zuo Daquan shook his head and said, “But Tang Xiu is truly a ruthless man. Not only does he kill so many people, but he also remembers my rejection and brings ruin to my coconut plantation. Nevermind it, there’s nothing we can do. We’ll just need to rebuild it after the end of their battle.”</p><p>“What I’m worried about is not the destruction of our site, Boss. But… the underground warehouse where we store a lot of our gold bars,” said the big man. “If the underground storehouse is exposed and these people find it, that will be too great of a loss.”</p><p>The gold?!!</p><p>Only then did Duo Zaquan’s mind turn blank and a panicked expression appeared on his face. Before he left the coconut plantation, he didn’t order his men to move all the gold from there and instead just sealed the underground storehouse.</p><p>Yet now, the battle was too intense and had destroyed the building. If the entrance to the underground storehouse was exposed, saying that it wouldn’t attract the greed of these people was nearly impossible. It was very likely that they would seize the massive gold he had accumulated.</p><p>‘What should I do?’</p><p>Zuo Daquan paced back and forth a few times as an idea suddenly came to his mind. He took out his mobile phone and dialed a number. After his call was picked up, he asked, “Have you settled Qing’er and the two children?”</p><p>“Yeah, we’ve got them settled, Boss.”</p><p>The voice of his trusted man came out in a low voice from the phone.</p><p>“We got some unforeseen events here. You’ll bring back Qing’er and the two boys secretly here,” ordered Zuo Daquan. “But remember, do not go to the coconut plantation. Take the southeast path and head to Old Ange’s place directly.”</p><p>“Understood,” replied the man as they directly hung up.</p><p>As Zuo Daquan put away his mobile phone, he said with a helpless face, “As of now, I can only hope that Tang Xiu will look at Qing’er’s face and take no offense from the rejection before. Perhaps only Qing’er can help preserve the gold should they find it.”</p><p>“We got no option but to keep the gold, Boss,” said the middle-aged strongman in a deep voice, “We won’t be able to fulfill Kanaja’s demand otherwise.”</p><p>“Of course I know that but…” said Zuo Daquan with a helpless expression, “You also know those damned bastards. One side is a bunch of monsters and demons, the other one is a bunch of freaks and ghosts! We can’t afford to mess with any of them.”</p><p>At this moment, several kilometers away from the scene, three black SUVs came rushing toward the coconut plantation. Inside these cars were eight men and a woman with quaint attire and particularly strange auras. Each of them brought a cold weapon and emitted out a faint bloody smell from their body.</p><p>From another direction, more than a dozen cars also rushed to the coconut plantation. In one of these cars was Kanaja, eyes gleaming.</p><p>“Godfather, we’ve come at this time. Are we going to be involved in their fight?”</p><p>There was a look of worry on Songzan’s face. He couldn’t help but ask.</p><p>“We’ll just stand to the side if we need to get involved in this,” said Kanaja lightly. “We’ll take the side of the winner and have some wine over their victory if we get involved. The situation in Bangkok will and must change. We got a dragon who crossed the driver and a bunch of local snakes. It will be very troublesome for us in the future if we don’t prepare as soon as possible.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
