It’s not that the retribution never comes, it’s just the time hasn’t yet arrived.</p><p>These vicious and fiendish people had done inexplicable crimes and evils—and now, retribution had come knocking at their door. No matter if it was Tang Xiu or Xue Yu, none of them had the slightest sympathy for them, while Tang Xiu himself was a man who had experienced too many things. He was deeply aware of the truth that eradicating fiendish people meant that countless good people would be protected from their scourge.</p><p>“Alright. We’ll hike up the mountains tonight.”</p><p>Tang Xiu looked up and spoke to Xue Yu after he hung up the call.</p><p>Xue Yu nodded. She understood Tang Xiu’s character. He never liked to be in the limelight and never liked to deal with trivial yet troublesome matters. Since the police would come over later, it was better for them to leave earlier.</p><p>“COME ON EVERYONE, HURRY UP! Don’t let Mr. Tang and his wife have any accidents!” Uncle Jia’s voice was heard outside the courtyard fence, whereas they could hear people’s footsteps getting clearer.</p><p>Tang Xiu and Xue Yu exchanged glances and they stepped out of the house. Outside, they saw Uncle Jia leading hundreds of men, women, and children and they were now just less than 20 meters away from the front gate.</p><p>When Uncle Jia saw Tang Xiu and Xue Yu coming out, he suddenly looked pleasantly surprised. He then ran over and asked, “Are you all right, Mr. Tang?”</p><p>Tang Xiu was somewhat touched on the inside. He could easily imagine how Uncle Jia felt restless for him and Xue Yu. After he came here, he immediately summoned all the villagers. All of these hundreds of people made up almost all of the inhabitants of the entire village.</p><p>“Uncle Jia, we’re all right, really.”</p><p>Uncle Jia heavily nodded and said, “This place is not safe, Mr. Tang. Hurry up and leave while there are only a few of the bad guys here!”</p><p>“How many hunters came here exactly?” asked Tang Xiu.</p><p>“Just seven, but each of them is a ruthless man,” answered Uncle Jia.</p><p>“If there are only seven of them, then there’ll be no problem anymore,” said Tang Xiu smilingly. “They are all inside the house now and I’ve knocked all of them down. By the way, the police will soon arrive, so we need to set off first. When the police get here, you can hand over these hunters to them.”</p><p>Uncle Jia gawked and stared blankly before he snappily said, “You’re an adult, Mr. Tang; how can you spit out such a joke at this time? Just listen to me. You’d better leave the troubles here and snatch the time and chance to leave. We can find some reason to avoid those bad people when they come again.”</p><p>Many villagers of this village had met Tang Xiu before and also shouted:</p><p>“Yeah, Mr. Tang. You don’t know how bad those people are. They have machetes and guns, so you gotta hurry in leaving this place!”</p><p>“Mr. Tang, Grandpa Jia didn’t joke with you. Just hurry up, else you won’t be able to go after those bad guys come back here.”</p><p>“Aiya, you’re still too young. You have no idea what danger is looming ahead. Those bastards are simply evil. They even dare to kill people.”</p><p>“Hurry up and go!”</p><p>“…”</p><p>Tang Xiu watched those simple yet pure appearances, each containing an expression of concern on their faces. He silently put aside what emotions he felt on the inside and said, “Everyone, just come to the house with me if you don’t believe me. I’ve already subdued those seven bad guys and they are now inside.”</p><p>“Mr. Tang…”</p><p>Upon seeing that Tang Xiu was still talking ridiculously, Uncle Jia immediately felt so vexed that he angrily stamped his feet and said, “You really like to brag, huh? Alright, I’ll go inside and have a look.”</p><p>Having said that, he strode into the house’s door, yet his pace came to an abrupt halt when he saw the scene inside, while a look of disbelief was cast on his aging face. The dozens of villagers who followed behind him also stopped suddenly. They were like losing their souls: tongue-tied and dumbfounded. They stared at the seven men who laid on the ground like dead dogs.</p><p>“Oh my God! Am I not dreaming? These… did these bad guys really get beaten by Mr. Tang?”</p><p>“How’s this possible? These bastards have machetes and guns. How can they be trashed like this by Mr. Tang?”</p><p>“Is Mr. Tang an expert martial artist from the martial arts world—someone not even afraid of bullets? I clearly heard gunshots before!”</p><p>“Damn. This is amazing!”</p><p>“…”</p><p>Tang Xiu kept smiling while listening to the voices of the villagers who were sobering up from their stunned state. Then he said with a smile, “Everyone, you’ve seen everything now. All these bad guys have been beaten by me, so hurry up and search if they have some dangerous goods. Also, it’s best to find some strong rope to tie them up. If they were to wake up before the police arrive, they would definitely try to do something dangerous to you.”</p><p>Uncle Jia seemed like he just woke up from a dream and hurriedly shouted, “Yes. Yes. That’s right. Mr. Tang is correct. All adults, you go and find some rope. They must be thick and strong to tie all these bad guys. Our village will be peaceful again as long as the lawmen come here and take them away.”</p><p>Quickly, Tang Xiu and Xue Yu left the village under the respectful gazes of all the villagers, leaving the off-road car left by Jie Walie in the village.</p><p>As the hazy dim night came and the stars appeared in the night sky, the duo finally arrived at their destination. Back then, Tang Xiu originally planned to use the cave to grow the efficacious medicinal herbs, yet he eventually took all of those herbs due to the appearance of Occult Sect’s people, which included the events of killing Jin Sanchi and Jin Sijie here. Nevertheless, the spiritual qi of the world in this place was still much richer than the outside world.</p><p>“Hey, are you tired?”</p><p>Tang Xiu, who was looking up at the top of the cave, took his gaze back and found that there was a weary look on Xue Yu’s face and that she appeared a bit dispirited.</p><p>“A bit.” Xue Yu gently nodded.</p><p>“You should take rest first while I’m studying this Six Starlight Array,” said Tang Xiu with a smile. “I’m going to ask you again if I bump into something I don’t understand, though.”</p><p>“No. Let’s study it together!” Xue Yu shook her head and said, “I wanna try to open this Immortal Trove soon.”</p><p>She was very clear that the Lian Family in Ning City would always be a mortal malady to them. If they couldn’t eradicate them as fast as possible, then it was needless to say that Tang Xiu was also concerned, while she herself felt a bit uneasy. She also knew that this Immortal Trove had been in existence for a long time, yet it had never been opened once. It kept nagging Tang Xiu’s mind, so the earlier they could open this Immortal Trove and make sure what was stored inside, the earlier Tang Xiu could resolve his concerns.</p><p>After spending all night studying it, the duo constantly attempted to grasp it and discussed their findings. Yet, the more they understood the mysteriousness of this Six Starlight Array, the more mystery they discovered from it. Nevertheless, after days and nights passed by and the third day came, the duo finally comprehended all the mysteries of the Six Starlight Array.</p><p>“Let me try it.”</p><p>Tang Xiu pointer finger acted like a flying sword as he began cracking the mystery of the array according to the orientation of the Six Starlight Array. When he had done all the correct methods he thought of, to his surprise, the Six Starlight Array only emitted a strong beam and then dissipated again silently.</p><p>“No, it shouldn’t be!” exclaimed Xue Yu, frowning. “Our cracking method should be correct given the reaction from the Six Starlight Array. How can it be terminated halfway?”</p><p>Tang Xiu was similarly puzzled. After being silent for a while, he touched his chin and murmured, “I think there’s something we overlooked. The Six Starlight Array is not an array from our country, but from the Western countries. The person who originally arranged this array must have other considerations in mind, but what exactly is it?”</p><p>Xue Yu shook her head and looked a bit frustrated, “Let’s drop it now and have some food! I haven’t had any grub for a day now.”</p><p>Tang Xiu nodded in response. He and Xue Yu had spent enormous energy after researching it for days; they had even overdraft their physical strength a bit. He was actually fine since he was an expert with a formidable physique and strength, allowing him to pass on drinking, eating, or sleeping for three to five days, but it was different for Xue Yu.</p><p>Immediately after, Tang Xiu took out some tableware from his interspatial ring before taking out some cooked meals, cold dishes, and some drinks and other types of delicacies. Then he said smilingly, “You should take a good sleep after the meal, alright? Maybe you’ll have some miraculous insight after relaxing and will suddenly think of the crux of the problem.”</p><p>“Alright, let’s sleep together,” said Xue Yu with a chuckle.</p><p>Tang Xiu inhaled deeply and forced a wry smile, “I’m not that sleepy, actually. I’ll be fine if don’t sleep for several days. Besides, I have an agreement with Miao Wentang that I’ll return to Ning City in seven days. Today is already the fourth day, so I’m afraid we’ll go back disappointed again if we don’t have any way to open this Immortal Trove.”</p><p>“Did you forget what you just told me—that you should turn around and forget it first?” rebuked Xue Yu. “Maybe you can have a revelation after the meal and after taking a good sleep. Besides, we’re just stuck one step away, so you may be able to open this Immortal Trove at any time as long as you can figure it out.”</p><p>Tang Xiu couldn’t help but laugh after hearing that his speech to Xue Yu just now was now used to strike him back. After hesitating a bit, he then took out two crystal cups and a bottle of red wine from his interspatial ring. After uncapping the cork, he filled the two cups and smilingly said, “People say that red wine is great for beautifying your face. Although it doesn’t taste good, let’s have a drink and have a good night’s sleep.”</p><p>Xue Yu took the red wine glass and gently swayed the bloody red wine inside. Just as she was preparing to toast with Tang Xiu, her expression suddenly changed and her eyes blinked, saying, “What do you think if this Six Starlight Array would need blood to be fully activated? You see, there are so many plots in the magical story from the Western people where they need all kinds of medium to achieve it, right? Perhaps, blood is exactly the medium of this Six Starlight Array!”</p><p>Tang Xiu’s expression changed. He immediately put the red wine cup down as his body floated to the top of the cave. He took out his Divine sword to scratch his finger. A drop of his blood instantly hit the line of the Six Starlight Array.</p><p>Buzz…</p><p>The dazzling white beams suddenly burst and shined the whole cave in a flash, appearing like the daytime sunlight. Along with a violent vibration and cracking sound, the Six Starlight Array was thoroughly activated. Wild joy immediately covered Tang Xiu’s face when he saw the scene. He didn’t expect that the key to activating the Six Starlight Array laid in the idea of a metaphorical of a bed of flowers that were arranged on the surface, while at the same time, inserting the willow to become the shade that covered them. It was the last moment’s idea of Xue Yu that was unexpectedly the key to activating the Six Starlight Array.</p><p>At this moment, Tang Xiu could vividly feel each streak of the Six Starlight Array, including every mysterious structure and the Six Starlight Array overall, which all seem to be imprinted in his mind.</p><p>The vibration then led to dust falling unceasingly from the rocks inside the cave, causing all the dishes and drinks on the table to be no longer able to be enjoyed. Tang Xiu floated down quickly to hug Xue Yu while at the same time releasing his Primal Chaos Force to protect both of them.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
