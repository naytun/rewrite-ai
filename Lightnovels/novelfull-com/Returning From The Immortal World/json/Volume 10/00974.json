As the smoke in the air gradually converged, more than a dozen experts from the Celestial Wizard clan gathered together. Injuries were apparent on their bodies, and some of them were even dying, falling to the ground when they appeared next to their companions.</p><p>Miserable and distressed were the perfect words to describe their condition!</p><p>The hand of Astraeus Soloch that held the staff was slightly trembling, yet his billowing killing intent emitted out, making the surrounding temperature to drop a few degrees. He was like a human that had turned into an ice sculpture. The death of Maz and Zalegly Soloch, the two elders of his Celestial Wizard clan, in the previous battle was a very heavy loss to them.</p><p>It was not like the Celestial Wizard Clan never lost members; many of them had died over the centuries due to battles against experts from the Pyramid organization or the League of Archcrusaders, but losing so heavily to this degree was a first. Added with the Wznieść and Wykres Brothers, his clan just lost four Elders as well as dozens of elites.</p><p>“Grand Elder.” With a ferocious and sorrowful expression on his face and black fog lingering around his body, Zalegly Soloch clenched his fists as he said in a heavy voice, “My brother is dead and so are many elites of our clan. The blood vendetta is due and must be avenged. Please give me the Sacred Fruit of Darkness and a few months of time. I want to command the warriors of Bloodspirit Hall’s regiment to thoroughly eliminate the enemies!”</p><p>“Do you think I don’t want revenge?” Astraeus Soloch angrily glared at him and furiously said, “You know that the enemy is too strong and they’re allied with the Whole Unitary Sect. There’s no way we can completely eradicate them unless we mobilize all the power our clan has!”</p><p>The response made Zalegly’s breath halt for a beat, as it reminded him the power possessed by the enemy as well as those horrifying magic spells and arts. He was suddenly unable to speak. The Grand Elder, Astraeus, was much more powerful than him, and he also realized that he couldn’t surpass the Grand Elder’s realm even though he took the Sacred Fruit of Darkness. Regardless of his effort to lead the Bloodspirit Hall’s warriors, it was impossible to completely eradicate the enemy; it was more likely to return in a corpse bag.</p><p>But he wouldn’t be a man if he didn’t exact revenge!</p><p>His blood brother, as well as many elites of his clan, had been killed. Must he just let it go and forget his revenge? Absolutely not!</p><p>Eyes gleaming with chilling light, Astraeus gazed towards the south distant sea covered by the night. Then he said in a heavy voice, “The blood of our clansmen must and will be paid by them, but we need to plan well. Though we may be able to exterminate all of our enemies by stubbornly facing them head-on with force, it’s very likely that our clan will also suffer heavy casualties. We’ll return back to the clan first and discuss it with our Patriarch.”</p><p>Using strategy?</p><p>Zalegly looked vacant for a moment before his eyes lit up and he said in a deep voice, “I think I have an idea about that, Grand Elder.”</p><p>“You do?” Astraeus looked confused and asked, “What is it?”</p><p>“Since we cannot have revenge using force against force ourselves, then how about using third party’s assistance and lure the parties to weed out the trouble?” said Zalegly. “We know that the three largest organizations—the Pyramid, the League of Archcrusaders, and the Stygian Club—have been competing in fierce fights for various resources. Although we are affiliated with the Stygian Club, our people are still independent, so we don’t need to participate in their affairs unless the organization is facing a life-and-death crisis. If we were to spread rumors that there are buried treasures in that sea area, I’m sure those three organizations will send their people to investigate it. As long as those people are still in that region, they will clash with them. By then, we can become the third party who will reap the fruit without much effort after the people from these three organizations fight with those people.”</p><p>“That’s a great idea!” Astraeus’s eyes lit up and he clapped. “We’ll have a chance to take advantage of the situation once all the parties have been mutually damaged. If it’s the case the Stygian Club has suffered a big loss and asks our assistance, we can push the boat along with the current, thus creating a good chance to slaughter those enemies once we return back to this area again!”</p><p>Zalegly repeatedly nodded and said, “I concur about that. But the most important thing is that as long as the Stygian Club requests our clan’s assistance, we must demand a lot of benefits in exchange. That way, we can make up for all the losses even if we must get into battles again, thus killing two birds with one stone!”</p><p>The idea was much to Astraeus’s approval, and he nodded with satisfaction. Saying in a deep voice, “It’s a feasible and good plan, yet we must carry it out in secret. Let us return to our clan first to discuss it with the Patriarch and other elders. We’ll spread the rumors afterward and then watch the tigers fight with each other”</p><p>“Alright. We shall go back.”</p><p>Zalegly nodded and looked at the rest.</p><p>****</p><p>Nine Dragons Island.</p><p>Tang Xiu spent half a day to restore his Primal Chaos power. He faintly sensed that his power seemed to have increased even after such huge consumption. Therefore, he directly took out the Demon Stone and began absorbing the energy inside it until it was fully absorbed.</p><p>‘That planet has grown bigger.’</p><p>With a satisfied face, Tang Xiu jumped off the bed and went to the bathroom to take a shower. After changing to a new set of clean clothes, he then headed straight to the northeastern part of the island.</p><p>A barrack had been built there. In fact, one barrack had been built in the Northeast, Northwest and Southeast parts of the island after the reconstruction, each of which could house 20,000 soldiers. There was also another barrack built in the center area of the island, but it was much smaller and could only accommodate 1,000 soldiers.</p><p>While standing on the rooftop of the six-story building, Tang Xiu glanced at the surrounding environment. In his mind, he was ruminating about the arrangement of the array, which he planned to have superposition effect for cultivation. The world energy in Nine Dragons Island was extremely dense, at least 10 times denser than the outside world. Yet, it was still not enough for Tang Xiu. He wanted it to be at least ten times, or even hundreds of times, denser, just like the blessed land in the Immortal World.</p><p>“The array should be the Spiritual Energy Gathering, Spiritual Energy Refining, and Star Energy Absorber arrays.</p><p>“The protection array for all of Nine Dragons Island already possesses a function to gather spiritual energy. It will continue absorbing the world energy in a 500km radius from the surrounding area, so the Spiritual Energy Gathering Array is no longer needed. But the Spiritual Energy Refining Array must be arranged so as to increase the purity of the world energy here. This array will also refine the absorbed stars’ energy into essence, thus bringing enormous benefits to those cultivating inside.</p><p>“So be it, then!”</p><p>After he ruminated and made up his mind, he immediately began to arrange the Spiritual Energy Refining and Star Energy Absorber arrays. The scale of these two arrays was small, so it was much easier for Tang Xiu to arrange them, taking only half a day to lay them out completely and making them fully compatible with each other.</p><p>“Here’s some water for you to drink, Master.”</p><p>Gu Yin had been around for half a day as well, and she immediately ran over to hand Tang Xiu a pink cup upon seeing him done arranging the arrays.</p><p>Tang Xiu threw her a smile and stroked her soft black hair. Then, he took the cup and sipped two mouthfuls of water. He spoke, “Apart from me and Ji Chimei, you should be the third most powerful person on the island, no? You have reached the early stage of Golden Core, and you should be able to break through to the middle stage of Golden Core soon. Yinyin dear, I think you’ll reach the peak of Golden Core in a short time if you keep progressing at your current rate. Maybe you can have a break through to the Nascent Soul Stage within the next few years.”</p><p>Gu Yin looked up with her adorable petite face and grinningly said, “My first goal is to ascend and becoming an immortal, Master. Didn’t you tell me that you’re going back there in the future? Yinyin must be with you no matter where you go, Master.”</p><p>“Sure. As long as Yinyin strives and is smart,” said Tang Xiu with a rush of warmness inside his heart.</p><p>“But Yinyin wants to learn from Senior Sister, Master.” Gu Yin shook her head and said, “Elder Ji told Yinyin a lot of things, especially about her, so I really like Senior Sister and admire her. When are you going to take Yinyin to see Senior Sister, Master?”</p><p>“Well, soon,” answered Tang Xiu smilingly.</p><p>“Would you like to take me with you to Jingmen Island?” asked Gu Yin, pleasantly surprised.</p><p>“Not now.” Tang Xiu shook his head and said, “Master is going tomorrow, but heading for Thailand to stay there for several days. Only then will Master return back to the Everlasting Feast Hall’s headquarters. After that, your Senior Sister will leave for Nine Dragons Island, so you can meet her by then.”</p><p>“Awesome!” Gu Yin exclaimed with shining eyes. “Then Yinyin will be able to ask Senior Sister about cultivation. Elder Ji told Yinyin that Senior Sister is very powerful and that she’s already an Immortal!”</p><p>Tang Xiu was stunned and stared blankly before a bitter smile covered his face.</p><p>It made him realize that he was their Master, yet a very weak one. However, Yinyin found out that her older Senior Sister was actually very powerful, thus making her think that she was the first expert.</p><p>‘Haih. It seems I must speed up the pace of my cultivation progress. Even if I can’t catch up to Yan’er in a short time, I cannot stay relaxed and become a slacker. Only by becoming stronger will I be able to protect the people I care about in the future.’</p><p>Tang Xiu looked up at the night sky. The Immortal World plane was beyond this vault of heaven. It was the place of his mortal enemies that kept biting his heart. His heart will never feel at peace unless he gets rid of them.</p><p>After a long while, he then came to the area specially built for entertainment on the island and walked through the streets that headed to the edge of the sea before he looked at the villa built there.</p><p>“Mr. Tang.” Singluen’s closest aide, the petite female, was the first to spot Tang Xiu and quickly greeted him.</p><p>Tang Xiu nodded to her and asked, “Is Singluen inside?”</p><p>“Since you ordered us to not stroll around the island at will, Young Master has been staying here and is waiting for you, Mr. Tang,” answered the feminine woman.</p><p>Nodding in response, Tang Xiu then entered the courtyard of the villa. He saw Singluen sitting cross-legged there amid the flowers in the courtyard. His hands were holding a Demon Stone each, and there was a faint black fog lingering around him.</p><p>“Singluen!” called Tang Xiu.</p><p>Singluen opened his eyes, and after he saw that it was Tang Xiu, he immediately put away the two Demon Stones and strode to the front of Tang Xiu, asking, “Are you done with your business here, Mr. Tang?”</p><p>“It’s almost settled, yeah.” Tang Xiu nodded and said, “Pack up your things. We’ll leave Nine Dragons Island by tomorrow to solve the issue with your big brother in Thailand.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
