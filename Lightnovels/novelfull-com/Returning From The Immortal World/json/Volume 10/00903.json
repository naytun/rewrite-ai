As he smirked with a sneer and was about to speak, he suddenly noticed that two belles wearing bikinis and sunglasses came over. They had good stature and had fine skin. He even noticed Yue Kai and Hu Qingsong gulp down at the same time at the sight of them.</p><p>‘What a bunch of immature brats!’</p><p>Tang Xiu was a bit at a loss whether he had to laugh or cry and asked them, “You two couldn’t be thinking to bounce up some fairies to heaven here, could you?”</p><p>Yue Kai and Hu Qingsong instantly blushed at the same time.</p><p>When the red-haired youth saw Tang Xiu ignore him, he suddenly yelled angrily, “Hey you, PUNK! You’re crazy enough, aren’t you? This Big Daddy is talking with you, yet you feign madness before me?”</p><p>Tang Xiu knitted his brows and said, “I don’t give a damn if you are annoying the hell out of others, but these guys are my buddies. You just put them in this state, so we have an account to deal with here. Do you think I’m crazy and feigning madness? You’ll know about it right away.”</p><p>With that said, Tang Xiu raced to the front of the red-haired youth and fiercely slapped him. He then pulled him from the ground and looked at the other dozen youths who wanted to storm over at him as he shouted with a heavy voice, “Think clearly boys. Fight me, and the consequences you’ll experience will be very serious.”</p><p>That stylish imposing manner immediately overwhelmed the onlookers!</p><p>More than ten youths who wanted to gang up on him had a slight change in expression. They were not with many connections and were without any sound background, yet they still could tell that Tang Xiu might be not ordinary given his imposing manner.</p><p>“Whoops, who’s this handsome guy?”</p><p>“So cool! I’ll definitely accept if he’s the one who pursues me!”</p><p>The two girls in bikinis now clearly discerned that Tang Xiu was handsome and called out grinningly—one was even quite bold and had a thick face as she came to Tang Xiu to pinch his arm.</p><p>Pa! Pa!</p><p>Tang Xiu directly slapped their faces, slumping them down on the beach before he coldly snorted at them, “You two are the sluts who have made these two brothers of mine get beaten. This will be the lesson for you two to not play the trick of the thorny rose in order to get laid.”</p><p>The red-haired youth struggled to climb up from the sandy beach and glared at Tang Xiu incredulously. With blazing anger, he burst out all the vexation inside his chest, “Are you all fucking stupid? BEAT HIM TO DEATH!”</p><p>Over a hundred meters away from them.</p><p>Mo Awu and the rest were bolting toward them. In just a few seconds, they had sprinted to a position nearby Tang Xiu and, right at the moment these ruffians stormed at Tang Xiu, Mo Awu’s group straightly acted, sending barrages of punches and kicks to beat dozens of them.</p><p>“Gulp…”</p><p>Once the stalwart men appeared with powerful kung fu, only then did the red-haired youth realize that they seemed to have provoked powerful people.</p><p>He had been a martial artist himself. More so that he had been practicing the True Spirit Martial School for about ten years. Ordinary groups of even five strong young men were not his opponents at all, while all the brothers around him were also his comrades who had been practicing kung fu at the same school for five-plus years. They usually had it easy in facing against two or three people; yet, more than ten of them had all been beaten in less than ten seconds, indicating that these big men were really powerful.</p><p>“You… who are you exactly?”</p><p>The red-haired youth paced back a few steps and asked vigilantly.</p><p>Tang Xiu ignored him and looked at Yue Kai and Hu Qingsong instead as he asked them, “Now tell me, both of you. What do you wanna do to these punks? Do you wanna make them disabled or straightly make them scram?”</p><p>“Give ’em a beating to vent our anger,” said Yue Kai loudly.</p><p>Hu Qingsong’s expression, however, was a bit strange. He was silent for several seconds before he held Yue Kai and shook his head, “Just let them scram! It’s indeed our fault for being careless and falling for their shitty trick this time. I’ll remember today’s lesson and will be more careful in the future.”</p><p>“They are nothing but some rabbles, Yue Kai,” said Tang Xiu smilingly. “No need to stoop down to their stupidity for you either. If you’re still irate with them, then beat them if you want. I and my men will break their limbs if any of them dares to fight back.”</p><p>Yue Kai hesitated for a moment and looked at Hu Qingsong. Then he shook his head and let out a dry smile, “Forget it then, man. They are just rabbles like you said and I’m too lazy to give a shit about them. Old Hu is right in any case. I won’t let any thoughts of getting laid cloud my judgement whenever I bump into this kind of situation again in the future.”</p><p>Tang Xiu nodded at his response with a smile. He then glanced at the crowd and said, “You all heard them. Do you still want the money then?”</p><p>“No, it’s our fault.”</p><p>“No, no, no. How dare we ask for that?”</p><p>“We’ll scram at once.”</p><p>“…”</p><p>More than ten of the badly beaten bludgers struggled to crawl up from the ground and ran toward the distance while replying, including the red-haired youth who also ran for tens of meters. When he felt that Tang Xiu’s group wouldn’t be able to catch up, however, he halted and turned around, shouting, “Just you wait for me! I’m not a man if I don’t pay this back. I’ll make you look great sooner or later!”</p><p>Mo Awu’s expression changed and he was about to immediately chase him.</p><p>Tang Xiu reached out to stop him and smilingly said, “They are just children. Speaking so fierce just to save face after experiencing a substantial loss. Let them scram and ignore them.”</p><p>Mo Awu nodded.</p><p>The two girls who had been slapped by Tang Xiu, however, didn’t run away like those young rabbles at the moment, nor did they look angry. What was strange from their actions was that they only looked surprised as the got up from the ground and just stood about seven-plus meters away, watching Tang Xiu as though they were looking at a rare, exotic animal.</p><p>“Hey, you two. If you don’t learn well while you’re still young, you’ll just become the parasite of the society later. Scram from this place and do think carefully to not walk further on the wrong road, will you?” reproved Tang Xiu at the two girls while pulling Hu Qingsong and Yue Kai to leave.</p><p>The two belles on the beach watched Tang Xiu’s back as he left. Suddenly, one of them called out loudly, “Hey, handsome, what’s your name and do you have a girlfriend?”</p><p>Unfortunately, she didn’t get the answer she wanted, yet they didn’t leave until Tang Xiu and the rest had disappeared on the distant road.</p><p>“Yueyue, he’s a real, cool guy. You know, I’m gonna clear things up with Red Hair immediately after I get back. I’ll definitely draw a clear line with him in the future. You see… I… I gotta set my sight on the journey of finding my love. I’m gonna chase up that cool, handsome fella,” vowed the taller girl while clenching her small fists.</p><p>The girl called Yueyue, replied, “I’m going with you, so let’s have a fair match, shall we? We’ll see whose skirt that cool and handsome fella will fall under.”</p><p>“Deal!”</p><p>Shortly after, the two belles let out happy laughter on the beach as they quickly strode towards the two luxurious supercars in the distant parking lot.</p><p>On the far side of the road, Chen Anhu watched the group of people returning back. His eyes fell on the swollen faces of Yue Kai and Hu Qingsong who got badly beaten. Then he looked at Tang Xiu as he strode forward towards him and said unhappily, “Your action was way too rash, Tang Xiu! You know the car was speeding at 100 km/hour, yet you still dashed out. What would I do if you got injured?”</p><p>“I’m fine, Uncle Chen,” said Tang Xiu smilingly, “It’s just that I suddenly saw these two brothers of mine getting bullied, so I couldn’t’ resist rushing over. Yue Kai, Old Hu, this is Uncle Chen, the Big Boss of the Dingfeng Group in Macao.”</p><p>“How do you do, Uncle Chen. I’m Yue Kai,” greeted Yue Kai politely.</p><p>“How do you do, Uncle Chen. I’m Hu Qingsong,” said Hu Qingsong.</p><p>Chen Anhu nodded at their greetings. With his eyesight, he could see that both of them were just ordinary people. They shouldn’t be people who had practiced martial arts. However, their attire indicated that they were not children of poor families, even though their clothes were not branded ones.</p><p>“Hello, you two!” nodded Chen Anhu, smiling. “So, you two clashed with some people? Do you want me to send some people to teach those kids a lesson?”</p><p>“Thanks for your kindness, but no thanks, Uncle Chen,” Hu Qingsong shook his head and said, “There’s no need to teach them. Big Bro Tang and his men have already taught them by beating them intensely, so we’ve already vented out our vexed feelings.”</p><p>“That’s great then. Feel free to find me if you got some problems later, though,” said Chen Anhu smilingly.</p><p>Tang Xiu patted their shoulders and smilingly said, “Well, since you both already made a trip to Macao, just have some fun here, got it? Though I want you two to behave for at least two days since you guys got injured. Wanna head over and stay in Uncle Chen’s place with me?”</p><p>Yue Kai exchanged glances with Hu Qingsong as the latter shook his head and said, “No, we’re not going to disturb Uncle Chen. But we’ll visit your home after we get better, though. Anyway, Big Bro Tang, what’s your next plan? You got some time to spare to have some fun with us?”</p><p>“I can’t.” Tang Xiu shook his head and said, “I’ll only stay in Macao until tomorrow and will leave for Thailand the day after. That’s right, if that bunch of people get you in trouble again after I leave, you can directly contact Uncle Chen and he’ll help you deal with it.”</p><p>“Got it! (No problem!)” nodded the duo.</p><p>Island Palace Garden, Villa A-058 in Tangxia District.</p><p>As the motorcade of off-road cars parked outside the villa’s entrance, Tang Yunde, who had been waiting for a long time, immediately rushed out and asked with concern, “How was it? Has the problem with the Zhangs been solved already?”</p><p>Chen Anhu happily nodded and praised, “Brother Yunde, I finally get why you said that now. Looking for Tang Xiu for help was absolutely correct! There have been only a few I admire in this life, and I gotta add one more to the list: Tang Xiu.”</p><p>“Ehh?” Tang Yunde couldn’t help but chuckle and responded, “What exactly did he do? To think that he’s worthy of such high praise from you.”</p><p>“You didn’t see it for yourself!” exclaimed Chen Anhu. “Tang Xiu not only has so many powerful men under him, but his own combat force is also astonishing. People said a powerful dragon can never suppress a local snake, but I saw a major drama subvert that saying. A powerful dragon does have the power to suppress a local snake until it cannot lift its head up high. Well, we’ve got our problems dealt with now. Even made a huge profit.”</p><p>“Huge profit?” asked Tang Yunde with a strange expression, “What exactly did we profit from?”</p><p>“Well, I’ll let Tang Xiu tell you that!” said Chen Anhu with a smile. “You’ll definitely be ecstatic after you hear it, though. Anyway, let’s go and talk inside, shall we?”</p><p>Tang Yunde looked at Tang Xiu with satisfaction before he nodded and took the lead to briskly stride into the villa.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
