After Primal Chaos power broke away the restriction of the black fog, they immediately bypassed the area shrouded by the black fog and continued the pursuit to the northeast.</p><p>The killing must be done and all the enemies must die! Even if Wykres Soloch was much stronger than them, they must accomplish Tang Xiu’s order no matter what.</p><p>Killing intent was still billowing in Tang Xiu’s mind. He passed through the black fog to continue chasing, following closely. He could sense the grief and indignation from Wykres Soloch who was running ahead, yet he had no compassion and pity at all. Enemies were enemies, and he had decided to kill them. Leaving a witness alive was not an option so that they could avoid much bigger troubles cropping up later.</p><p>“You can never escape!”</p><p>The divine sword under his feet flashed ahead like a shooting star, carrying him and finally blocking Wykres Soloch on the edge of Nine Dragons Island in less than a minute. At that instant, he conjured the Lightning Evoker Art. Dark clouds suddenly combined to cover the clear sunny sky as lightning sparks and the rumbling of thunder followed. Arm-sized lightning bolts came blasting down from the layers of cloud in the firmament and bombarded the frantically fleeing Wykres Soloch the instant after.</p><p>Two kilometers away in midair, the shocked expressions of the six youths turned much more intense, causing one to shout frantically, “Lightning Evoker Art?! He unleashed a genuine Lightning Evoker Art! Its might is much more powerful than the same art our Ancestor Master once used.”</p><p>“Who exactly is he, and why does he have such a high cultivation level? How can his Lightning Evoker Art be this powerful to an unthinkable extent?”</p><p>“Look! The number of lightning bolts is increasing. It’s like a sea of lightning!”</p><p>“Amazing!”</p><p>“…”</p><p>The youngest one among them shouted with a shocked face, “Quickly activate the Communication Charm to inform Master and our Ancestors! Tell them about the situation here.”</p><p>Towards the northeast of Nine Dragons Island, lightning and thunder raged within a one kilometer area, causing it to be shrouded in lightning. The scene was as though a downpour of electric rain from the heavens. Even though Wykres Soloch was very powerful and kept fending off the powerful lightning bolts, he could only persist for a short time before he was turned into a charred crisp by the continuous downpour of lightning.</p><p>Tang Xiu flew higher and stood in the air as he retracted back the divine sword into his body. Along with the dispersal of the Lightning Art, the lightning stopped descending and the dark cloud in the sky quickly dissipated. He then looked at Wykres Soloch’s charred corpse and chillingly shifted his sight to the vast sea in the distance.</p><p>“The Celestial Wizard clan.”</p><p>He knew that the issue was not yet over. Aside from those six young cultivators who came from a mysterious sect nearby, the two black-robed old men had also informed their Celestial Wizard clansmen. This issue was bound to be very troublesome.</p><p>“Is everyone alright, Awu?” asked Tang Xiu as he turned to Mo Awu’s group who just caught up.</p><p>“Four died and six are injured. But everyone else is alright,” answered Mo Awu. “You’re much stronger now, Boss.”</p><p>“Walking on the cultivation path is just like boating against the current. You’ll only be left behind if you can’t move forward,” responded Tang Xiu.</p><p>“Yet, the speed of your progress is still too fast, Boss,” said Mo Awu with a forced smile. “Every one of us thought that we’d catch up with you soon, but then we realized we are just getting further and further. These two old geezers were very powerful. I don’t think I would’ve been able to face any of them had it been a one-on-one fight.”</p><p>“You’re all already very good regardless,” said Tang Xiu. “After all, you guys started from ordinary martial artists and began cultivating less than a year ago. However, I admit that there’s still a big gap between you and those six youths. To my surprise, they’re so young, yet they have all advanced to the late stage of Foundation Establishment. That makes me wonder how strong their sect is.”</p><p>“You previously told me that this island is a blessed land—a treasure trove that cultivators dream to have, Boss,” replied Mo Awu hurriedly with a slightly changed expression. “Those six boys now also know about this; have you thought about it and decided on anything? Do you want us to remove them?”</p><p>Tang Xiu shot a glance at the southern sky before he shook his head and said, “Let’s not deal with them for now. However, tell everyone to guard against them nonetheless. As long as they don’t commit any harmful deeds on the island, don’t clash with them. It’s likely that the sect behind them is quite powerful judging from them being so young while being at the late stage of Foundation Establishment. We are still weak and need time for now.”</p><p>“I understand.” Mo Awu nodded.</p><p>Tang Xiu ruminated for a short while before he flew straight to the six youths who were floating midair in the distance. As he came before them, he sported a smile on his handsome face, cupping his fists over to say, “Little Brothers, I’m rather surprised to see you all. So young, yet at such a cultivation level. Let me introduce myself. I’m surnamed Tang with a given name Xiu, the owner of this Nine Dragons Island. May I know your name and the sect you guys come from?”</p><p>The first youth returned the ceremony and said, “My name is Jin Chanzi. These are my five brothers: Jin Xingzi, Jin Fengzi, Jin Yungzi, Jin Huozi, and Jin Yanzi respectively. We’re all disciples of the Unitary Whole Sect with Daoist Zixuan as our Master. Fellow Daoist Tang, may I also know from which sect you originate from?”</p><p>“I did not originate from any sect or school,” said Tang Xiu smilingly. “And these men have been trained by myself as well. May I know the reason why you have come to my Nine Dragons Island, Jin Chanzi?”</p><p>“Our elders ordered us to leave our Small World and travel outside to gain experience. It’s just we happened to run into these two Western wizards when they committed some evil deeds, so we tracked them all the way here. I know we came here without your consent and permission as the land owner, so we hope that Fellow Daoist Tang can forgive us.”</p><p>Upon hearing such a cultured reply from Jin Chanzi, Tang Xiu felt like he fell into his own reverie since all the cultivators in the Immortal World also addressed each other with “Fellow Daoist”. He didn’t expect that he would also run into the same custom on Earth today.</p><p>“It’s alright. I already heard about it from my subordinates. In fact, it is I who should thank you guys. If it weren’t for you all coming here in time, I could have lost more men and those two old geezers may have ruined the whole island.”</p><p>“Fellow Daoist Tang is too polite. We naturally cannot let those wicked wizards off with their atrocious deeds,” replied Jin Chanzi modestly.</p><p>“I think you guys are just a few years younger than me, so there’s no need to call me Fellow Daoist,” said Tang Xiu with a smile. “How about we just address each other with Brother? You can call me Big Brother Tang, and I will call you Little Brother.”</p><p>The six martial brothers exchanged glances and all of them nodded in agreement. They had witnessed Tang Xiu’s power and knew that he was definitely stronger than them. Seeing Tang Xiu’s humble attitude wanting to befriend them, they were naturally unwilling to refuse.</p><p>“Alright then, Little Brothers. We’ve killed those two Celestial Wizard geezers, so it can be said that we’ve removed the source of a disaster, making my island peaceful for the time being,” said Tang Xiu with a smile. “Let’s head to my place and have a chat there.”</p><p>“Alright!” nodded the six youths.</p><p>Shortly after Tang Xiu took the six youths to the palace, he ordered some people to prepare some dishes and wine, while he headed to the reception room on the first floor to chat. After the talk, he learned that the Whole Unitary Sect only had a few disciples, about a few dozen, and the six of them were the disciples at the lowest rank there.</p><p>“You guys are the lowest rank in your sect, yet you have reached such a cultivation level. Then I suppose the elders of your sect should be much more powerful, yes? Does your sect have experts at the Nascent Soul Stage?” asked Tang Xiu with a smile.</p><p>The question made Jin Chanzi hesitate, yet he still nodded and said, “Our sect’s respected Grand Elder is at the Nascent Soul Stage. But the elderly have always been in seclusion for many years and seldom appear for decades. I heard from Master that the elderly only came out when a world phenomenon occurred a few decades ago. It may sound laughable to you, Brother Tang. But we all have never met with our Grand Elder either.”</p><p>“You just said about the world phenomenon a few decades ago; what kind of phenomenon was it, exactly?” asked Tang Xiu.</p><p>“We don’t know much about it either. But I heard from the sect’s elders that it was like two terrifying auras,” said Jin Chanzi as he added further, “It is said that the whole sky looked as if it was bleached by blood when those two auras appeared, like the advent of the world was arriving. Also, our sect elder conducted divination and said it was probably an omen that something big will happen. Ultimately, a few decades passed by, yet nothing big has occurred.”</p><p>Two auras?</p><p>A sudden realization came to Tang Xiu’s mind immediately. He felt that the world phenomenon at that time should have occurred due to the arrival of Gu Yan’er and Ji Chimei.</p><p>Shortly after, Tang Xiu asked about another issue again, “Your Whole Unitary Sect used reside in China, right? How did the entire sect and the disciples migrate to Singapore all of a sudden? Was it because some accidents occurred in your sect?”</p><p>“No, it’s not because my sect had any accident whatsoever,” replied Jin Chanzi with a smile. “It’s because our elder found an entrance to a pocket dimension which leads to a Small World somewhere in Singapore. The elderly then conducted explorations and finally determined that this Small World was a blessed land. Another reason was due to the situation in the mainland where China had just been founded as a country. The country was in turmoil, hence our decision to move into this small world.”</p><p>Tang Xiu was suddenly enlightened. He already knew that there were entrances to small worlds on Earth. For instance, there was the report from his subordinate who had discovered one such entrance. However, due to a lack of power at that time, he didn’t want to take a risk and directly explore it, thus putting the idea on hold until now.</p><p>‘I should allocate some time to explore this small world after I’m done dealing with the upcoming battle. Such small worlds usually have a lot of precious resources and treasures, so I hope that this small world also has a lot of cultivation resources,’ thought Tang Xiu before he immediately shifted his attention to the six youths again.</p><p>Suddenly, Jin Chanzi inquired, “Big Brother Tang, you told me you have no sect nor school and that you train all of your men yourself. Could you tell me more details about that? Could it be that your cultivation art is an inheritance from your family?”</p><p>“No. I accidentally obtained cultivation art and unintentionally tried to practice it.” Tang Xiu shook his head and smilingly said, “I didn’t expect it to be successful, nor did I expect to continue practicing until I arrived at my present cultivation level. I also had some chance encounters during several adventures and obtained a few cultivation manuals.”</p><p>Jin Chanzi immediately understood and replied with envy, “I once heard from the sect’s elders that there are indeed some ancient cultivator’s inheritances scattered around Earth. But it seems like we don’t have the kind of luck you have and haven’t yet chanced upon any fortuitous encounters. Also, Big Brother Tang, I saw your fight with those two shamans. You conjured the Lightning Evoker Art back then. It looks very powerful.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
