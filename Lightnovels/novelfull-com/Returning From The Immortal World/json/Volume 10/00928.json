I should come back a week later after I’ve finished the matter there. I’ll find ways to get rid of them by then.”</p><p>“You wanna go to Kanas?” Miao Wentang was surprised and asked, “What do you wanna do there?”</p><p>“Some trivial things,” answered Tang Xiu with a faint smile.</p><p>Seeing that Tang Xiu didn’t want to explain it, Miao Wentang no longer asked but nodded and said instead, “I’ll send some men to continue investigating the Lian Family during the week you’re gone, so as to provide you with as much help as possible.”</p><p>“No need.” Tang Xiu shook his head and said, “Leave them to Awu and his comrades. They’ll be responsible for the intel, so your family doesn’t need to be involved for the time being. The Lian Family will certainly be seething in a rage after finding that their Patriarch, two ancestors, and more than 20 elite experts have been killed. Any clues that they might discover at such a time would be very dangerous.”</p><p>“Had we not investigated and found something last night, I’d perhaps proudly say that the Miao never would fear the Lians. But now, I realized that my family doesn’t have what it takes to fight them. Alright, I’ll listen to you and hold back until we receive your next message,” said Miao Wentang with a forced smile.</p><p>Tang Xiu nodded. Even he was wary of the Lian Family now, let alone Miao Wenatang. If the Lian Family were to find out that the Miao harbored some bad intentions towards them, they might vent their rage towards the Miao; even the whole family may be massacred.</p><p>Certainly, given Miao Wentang’s strength, he would be able to kill a large number of the Lian Family’s experts easily. Yet, even a hungry tiger isn’t able to fight against a pack of wolves. If those 40-plus ancestors of the Lians were to join hands, the probability that Miao Wentang would be able to escape unscathed was close to nil.</p><p>As the afternoon came, Tang Xiu and Xue Yu arrived at Kanas Airport. They had contacted Jie Walie before, so the duo saw the man already waiting for them with arms folded not far away right after they came out of the airport.</p><p>“Yo, Brother Tang!”</p><p>Jie Walie approached and called out. He was a bit surprised after seeing Xue Yu, but he was still warmly greeted.</p><p>Tang Xiu exchanged a hug with him and then smilingly said, “I must trouble you this time, Big Brother Jie. By the way, this is my woman, Xue Yu. Xue Yu, this is a big brother of mine I told you about, Jie Walie.”</p><p>“Big Brother Jie Walie,” greeted Xue Yu smilingly with a nod.</p><p>Jie Wali raised his thumb up to Tang Xiu and praised, ‘You’re truly blessed, Brother Tang. To think you can find and marry a stunning and beautiful goddess such as this Miss Xue. Anyway, the car is waiting outside, so shall we go now, or do you want to visit my place first? Or, do you have something else in mind…”</p><p>“Just send us directly to that village in Longquan Bay!” said Tang Xiu. “That’s the reason we came here this time. I failed to open the Immortal Trove back then, so I gotta try again this time to see what kind of treasures are stored inside it.”</p><p>“Got no problem with that!” Jie Walie chuckled.</p><p>At Longquan Bay.</p><p>After Jie Walie gave a ride to Tang Xiu and Xue Yu to their destination, he didn’t stay long as he was aware that some things were meant to be avoided. He just casually left the Wrangler jeep for them and then left.</p><p>At the entrance of the village not far away, Xue Yu asked, “Is this the place where you had a battle back then? It seems like there are only a few people inhabiting this place.”</p><p>“There aren’t many locals indeed. But from my previous contact with them last time, I found these people here are very kind and easy to get along with. Alright, let’s head there. I’ve rented a house here for a year, so we have the right to occupy it.”</p><p>Xue Yu smiled and nodded in response, then walked alongside Tang Xiu to enter the village. Shortly after they entered, they saw an old man with a harpoon come out from the inside. The old man suddenly looked surprised when he saw Tang Xiu. He looked hesitant for a moment before he ran over and asked, “Aren’t you Mr. Tang?”</p><p>“You really got a good memory, Uncle Jia,” replied Tang Xiu with a smile. “That’s right. It’s me.”</p><p>Uncle Jia turned to glance around the village twice before he hurriedly turned his head and said, “Are there only two of you coming here, Mr. Tang? Did you bring the rest of your people like last time?”</p><p>“Uh?! They didn’t come with me this time.” Tang Xiu was confused and asked, “What exactly happened here for you to ask such a question, Uncle Jia?”</p><p>Uncle Jia forced a wry smile and said, “Mr. Tang, I advise you not to go to the house you rented last time if you didn’t bring those people with you. If anything, I still have an empty room in my place, so let’s head to my home first. I’ll tell my wife to clean up the room for you to stay in.”</p><p>Tang Xiu realized that there was something wrong and asked, “Exactly what happened here, Uncle Jia?”</p><p>“A bunch of bad and rampant people came to the village in these past few months. Not only are they always bullying the people in our village, but they also have taken away and currently occupy the house you rented. You’d just invoke trouble if you were to rashly come over there,” said Uncle Jia with a helpless expression.</p><p>Having said that, he then pointed to Xue Yu and then shook his head.</p><p>Coldness flashed in Tang Xiu’s eyes, yet he let out a smile and said, “We’re all reasonable people, plus I have rented that house, so I have the right to stay there. We are not people who bully others, but if they want to bully us, I’ll never let them feel better doing that. Ah, that’s right. Do you know the origin of these people?”</p><p>“Just listen to me, will you?” Uncle Jia waved and said, “You mustn’t mess with them. They…. They’re drifting hunters from some other places.”</p><p>“Hunters?” Tang Xiu was confused.</p><p>“Uncle Jia, the hunters you just mentioned, are they the kind of illegal hunters—poachers who illegally hunt rare animals?” asked Xue Yu.</p><p>“You also know those kinds of people, lass?” said Uncle Jia with amazement. “You’ve guessed it right. There are a lot of precious animals near Longquan Bay, some of which are quite valuable, so they come here every few years and stay here for several months. Come on and head to my home, you two. There aren’t many people coming this time, so the spare room in my house should be enough for you to rest in.”</p><p>Tang Xiu pondered for a moment and felt that there was no need to make things complicated. Since he could stay in Uncle Jia’s home, then he might as well lodge there. In any case, they would only stop by for a few days before the entered the depth of Longquan Bay to open the Immortal Trove, to begin with.</p><p>“Hey, Fifth, get your ass move fucking fast. The Boss wants Shaojiu liquor. If you can’t buy it again, be warned that he’ll skin you alive!”</p><p>“I know. I know, motherfucker! What a nuisance! What are you pushing me for? Even if this father had three legs, I still would have to run there, wouldn’t I?”</p><p>Two loud shouts were heard, followed by two strong big men who ran in tandem from the outside into the village. When the big man in front saw Tang Xiu and Xue Yu, however, he abruptly stopped his pace. His eyes widely stared at Xue Yu without blinking, looking like he was nearly drooling.</p><p>“What the fuck are you doing, Fifth? Why the hell aren’t you running faster?”</p><p>Behind him was a bald man with a tattoo on his neck, who then cursed and slapped the head of the big man in front.</p><p>The stocky man who was called Fifth pointed to Xue Yu and stutteringly said, “A beauty… such a beautiful woman… she’s even more… beautiful than those… celebrities on TV.”</p><p>The bald man stared blankly and looked up to see Tang Xiu and Xue Yu. His eyes instantly glued on Xue Yu as he voraciously looked up and down her body. He gulped down and exclaimed, “Holy cow, who is this woman? She’s so hot and so fucking beautiful!”</p><p>Xue Yu looked at them with obvious disgust and immediately reached out to grab Tang Xiu’s hand.</p><p>A cold light gleamed in Tang Xiu’s eyes. He then turned to ask Uncle Jia, “Are they those hunters you told me about? Those rampant and wicked guys?”</p><p>“Please don’t speak carelessly, Mr. Tang! It will spell trouble,” said Uncle Jia in a hurry. “We… we can’t afford to provoke… these people. They have guns…”</p><p>Tang Xiu sneered and sternly yelled at the two stocky men who were staring at Xue Yu, “What the hell are you looking at? Look at her again and I’ll gouge your eyes out. Scram and get the fuck out—else be careful, since I’ll clean you up.”</p><p>Only then did the bald man’s eyes leave from Xue Yu’s body. As his eyes fell on Tang Xiu, he creased his brows and cursed, “From which stone did you come out from, punk? Careful with your shitty mouth or I’ll trash you up!”</p><p>The big man who was called Fifth looked at Tang Xiu a few times and then pulled the bald man’s hand, whispering some words to him. The duo then left without forgetting to shoot a threatening glare to Tang Xiu before they turned around and ran towards the village.</p><p>After seeing the situation, Uncle Jia immediately said in a panic, “Mr. Tang, I advise you, please leave here quickly! Looking at those two bastards’ drooling face, I’m sure they are harboring evil intentions. If you stay in the village, if they enact their evil plan, I’m afraid…”</p><p>“I suddenly have changed my mind, Uncle Jia,” interrupted Tang Xiu. “These hunters are bad people, so I won’t give them the house I already rented for free. Just go back to your home first. I’m going to see them.”</p><p>“Please don’t, just stop, Mr. Tang,” said Uncle Jia hurriedly. “Don’t do it. Don’t be tempted to act on impulse. As far as I know, those people not only kill rare animals but also dare to kill people. I heard that… I heard they killed people two years ago and also murdered some local policemen.”</p><p>“They murdered policemen, yet nobody has caught them?” asked Tang Xiu, confused.</p><p>“Who would dare apprehend them?” said Uncle Jia with a forced smile. “This region is vast and sparsely populated and there’s a lot of places for them to hide here literally everywhere. Besides, these guys come and go without a trace. It’s so easy for them to avoid the lawmen’s hunt.”</p><p>“Since they even kill people, then I’ll act as an agent to enforce justice on behalf of the Heavens today,” sneered Tang Xiu. “Uncle Jia, please go back to your home first! I’ll treat you to a drink tonight.”</p><p>“Please don’t show off, Mr. Tang!” said Uncle Jia in a hurry. “There are seven or eight of them, none of who are a good person. You… if you were to rashly see them, you’ll be just like a meat bun fed to the dogs. You won’t be able to come back… and also, if this lass follows you, she…”</p><p>“I appreciate your kindness, Uncle Jia, but I apologize,” waved Tang Xiu with a smile.</p><p>Having said that, he pulled Xue Yu’s hand and strode toward the direction of the house he had rented. He wouldn’t have decided to go directly if it was just those two guys. But now, he obviously couldn’t stand idly by. Even if he didn’t want to bother with making trouble with these guys, it was highly likely that they would try to find him first and cause misfortune.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
