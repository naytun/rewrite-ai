Remember, head straight to Nine Dragons Island. As long as you get there, Daoist Tang will definitely be able to save your lives.”</p><p>“Master!” hurriedly shouted Jin Chanzi.</p><p>With an angry face, Daoist Zixuan glared at him and transmitted her voice again, “This is my order, and you must obey it! The Celestial Wizard Clan’s Grand Elder is very strong; his cultivation is comparable to mine. I have the confidence to escape from here myself, but I can’t protect you all with so many of you here. Go quickly!”</p><p>Jin Chanzi clenched his fists tightly. He was intensely unwilling and angry in his heart as he hated himself for being weak. If he were powerful enough, he could stay and fight side-by-side with his Master, instead of leaving her alone amid a serious dilemma.</p><p>At the same time, a pang of regret was also nipping at his heart. If it weren’t for his decision to inform his Master, they wouldn’t have fallen into such danger, nor would his Master have fallen into such a grave situation.</p><p>While gritting his teeth, Jin Chanzi sent out his voice to his five martial brothers and five martial sisters, relaying their Master’s message to them, telling them, “Junior Brothers, Senior Sisters, we must escape as quickly as possible so as to not become Master’s burden—else, Master’s life will be in danger if we can’t escape from this place.</p><p>“RUN!”</p><p>The other nine people had the same feelings as Jin Chanzi—angry, yet helpless, making them only to have one choice. They immediately unleashed their magical tools or weapons to fly towards Nine Dragons Island and abandoned their ship.</p><p>A contemptuous smile appeared on Astraeus Soloch’s lips. He coldly snorted and said, “Hmph, capture them alive! Don’t let anyone of them escape!”</p><p>“Affirmative!”</p><p>Dozens of figures streaked into the sky from the three liners lightning fast. At the same time, black mist billowed and quickly pursued Jin Chanzi’s group of ten. Three figures among the others were particularly fast and were able to intercept the ten people who had just fled a few kilometers away.</p><p>Daoist Zixuan’s face turned a bit pale and her figure flickered toward her ten disciples. However, another blob of black fog suddenly appeared out of nowhere as Astraeus Soloch was seen holding his staff. The old man looked frail and decrepit, yet the aura exuding out of his body was immense.</p><p>“We are yet to have our fight, so where are you going?” Astraeus Soloch blocked Daoist Zixuan’s path, waving the magic staff faster to create bubbles of black fog that revolved around Daoist Zixuan, constricting her movements and surrounding her within a radius of 100 meters.</p><p>At this moment, immense killing aura blasted out from Daoist Zixuan. Sword beam energy jetted out as she brandished the long sword in her hand and stabbed the black fog bubbles. With such intensity, the air current in the surrounding space turned chaotic.</p><p>“Fused Myriad of Swords!”</p><p>The sword qi shattered the black fog bubbles and ultimately formed a sword beam 100 meters long that sent out a chilling sensation. The brilliant sword beams then swept over to steamroll Astraeus Soloch instantly.</p><p>“Tenebrous Domain!”</p><p>With raucous laughter, a scythe-shaped weapon suddenly appeared in Astraeus Soloch’s hand. The scythe suddenly revolved around him lightning-fast and clashed with the hundred-meter sword beam head-on in that instant. Numerous black fog bubbles then appeared yet again and densely covered every direction around Daoist Zixuan.</p><p>BOOM!!!</p><p>The collision of the two weapons produced huge shock waves, causing Daoist Zixuan’s body to greatly tremble. Obviously shocked, she cried out, “The Grim Reaper Scythe? Dammit… your Celestial Wizard clan succeeded in obtaining the Death God magical weapon, the Grim Reaper Scythe, from the exploration 300 years ago?”</p><p>“You guessed it right. Hahaha…” Astraeus Soloch burst into laughter. “My father got this scythe while all of you were fighting the other forces then. If I remember correctly, your Whole Unitary Sect should’ve lost a lot in the battle for the treasure back then, no? Hahaha… I was finally able to fully control this Grim Reaper Scythe as my own magical weapon after 300 years of refining it. Unless you can destroy it, it will definitely drink your blood today.”</p><p>As a response, Daoist Zixuan swiftly casted a secret art, causing dark clouds to quickly appear in the sky, followed by bolts of lightning that flashed down from the heavens to crush the black fog bubbles beneath. At the moment when the bubbles were combusting, another sword beam swept over from her and blasted toward the revolving Grim Reaper Scythe that was striking at her.</p><p>While her defense was by no means weak, the power of the Grim Reaper Scythe was too immense. Despite going all out to fend it off, it was still able to penetrate her defense and create a small wound on her body.</p><p>“Linked Strike—Devastation!”</p><p>Astraeus Soloch suddenly shouted. Tens of black fog bubbles that hadn’t yet been destroyed by lightning bolts suddenly blasted out and created a blazing black flame, surrounding Daoist Zixuan within as it continued bombarding her.</p><p>“Puah…”</p><p>Daoist Zixuan’s body was trembling even more as she coughed up a mouthful of blood. At this moment, a desperate expression appeared on her face. Had her top-tier magic longsword not been broken, she was confident that she would be able to fend off Astraeus Soloch’s strike. Yet now, she seemed to see the future where she had to flee and suffer heavy losses while her ten disciples were also killed.</p><p>A few kilometers away from the battle scene, Tang Xiu’s eyes were flickering as he issued an order, “Awu, you’re to enter the stage now!”</p><p>Nodding in silence, Mo Awu flashed forward as though he was an artillery shell being shot into the battlefield from the distance. His flying sword was extremely fast, and he appeared in the middle of the battle in the blink of an eye, shouting loudly, “Dammit, how come so many wretched Celestial Wizard clansmen are crowding here? I obviously killed those two old farts previously, but from which shithole do their other wretched clansmen appear from, huh?”</p><p>In that instant, all the experts from the Celestial Wizard clan had twisted faces. They ceased their movements and attacks on the Whole Unitary Sect members and turned around to look at Mo Awu with intense killing intent evident in their eyes.</p><p>Astraeus Soloch’s expression instantly changed upon hearing Mo Awu’s declaration. He previously intended to launch a final blow to kill Daoist Zixuan and claim his victory, but he gave up on chasing Daoist Zixuan after seeing Mo Awu. He instantly shifted his flying direction and immediately flung toward the latter, shouting ferociously, “Are you the one who killed Wznieść and Wykres Soloch?”</p><p>Mo Awu’s eyes sparkled and he laughed loudly, “Hahaha, so those two old farts were the Soloch Brothers Wznieść and Wykres, huh? Heh, those two shitheads previously said that I wasn’t qualified to know their names when I asked about it. I’m fucking sure they must be regretting not telling me their names now. Hey, old fart! What’s your shit name? Mo Awu never kills a nameless person.”</p><p>The profanity from Mo Awu made Astraeus Soloch’s eyes blaze with fury as he propelled over instantly. Surging black fog blotted out the sky and flooded toward Mo Awu, while the Grim Reaper Scythe also spiraled forward to strike him.</p><p>“You cretin. I swear I’m not a human if I don’t kill you today!” roared Astraeus furiously as he launched his attacks.</p><p>Mo Awu himself was perfectly aware of how terrifying Astraeus was, and thus didn’t want to face him at all. He just spared a glance at the steamrolling black fog that came at him and let out a strange laugh before he quickly fled from the direction of his coming, crying out loudly, “Holy cow! This wretched old fart is really too strong! From which grave did all you Celestial Wizard demon spawn come from, huh?! I thought this Big Daddy had enough power; I never thought that there was an old fart stronger than me. Heh, if my Boss knew that you’re bullying me, he would definitely kick and blast your balls off. Ah, no! I was wrong. You’re almost old enough to be a fossil, so you must have no balls left, right?”</p><p>All the profanities spat out by Mo Awu truly enraged Astraeus Soloch to the extreme, causing his face to be red in fury.</p><p>How many years had it been since someone dared to curse him with such profanity? Never once had he ever imagined that he would run into an unknown loony in the sea, a reckless lunatic who knew nothing about death and dared to curse him with such toxic words.</p><p>“You… Must. Die!!!”</p><p>Astraeus Soloch accelerated even faster. With his greater power, he was able to catch up with Mo Awu despite the latter possessing a top-tier flying sword.</p><p>“You wretched old fart!”</p><p>Yet, Mo Awu still threw vicious curses while fleeing. He had escaped more than a dozen nautical miles in less than half a minute. However, behind him was not only Astraeus Soloch hot on his heels, but also all the other experts of the Celestial Wizard Clan who gave up on besieging the Whole Unitary Sect’s members, leaving only Mo Awu in their eyes, the culprit who had murdered their clansmen.</p><p>Thousands of meters high in the sky, Ji Chimei and Tang Xiu stood atop the clouds while watching Mo Awu being pursued, each with sneers on their faces. They had calculated that even though Astraeus Soloch was faster than Mo Awu, the latter would definitely be able to arrive at the 9th island before the enemy caught up.</p><p>“Those from the Whole Unitary Sect are not continuing their escape, my Lord,” reported Ji Chimei after she unleashed her spiritual sense.</p><p>“Let’s ignore them for now,” said Tang Xiu lightly. “We need to keep some of these Celestial Wizard Clan experts on the 9th island. I just hope that only a few of my men die from this trial.”</p><p>“I think the Everlasting Feast Hall’s experts won’t be their matches if we’re not involved, my Lord,” said Ji Chimei. “Especially the old fart who’s chasing Awu. He at least has the power comparable to a late-stage Golden Core expert. I think he wouldn’t even be at a disadvantage if he had to contend against some quasi Nascent Soul Stage experts either.”</p><p>“What about Tang Guang and Tang An?” asked Tang Xiu. “Is there a possibility for them to win against him?”</p><p>“Tang Guang and Tang An have made rapid progress recently and they just broke through the middle-stage of Golden Core,” answered Ji Chimei as she added, “They may be able to fight him if they both fight him together, but…”</p><p>“But what?” asked Tang Xiu.</p><p>“Tang Guang and Tang An can fight that old fart equally, but there are still the other three experts among the Celestial Wizard clansmen,” said Ji Chimei. “Those three are very strong, and I’m afraid no one from the Everlasting Feast Hall are able to fight them, while we also don’t have an advantage in number.”</p><p>Tang Xiu was silent for a moment before turning his head to look towards the direction of the Whole Unitary Sect members.</p><p>Above the sea, Daoist Zixuan was gathered with her ten disciples. The battle they just fought a moment ago had left her with injuries, while bleeding wounds could be seen on the bodies of Jin Chanzi’s group of ten as well.</p><p>“Master, it’s Mo Awu.”</p><p>Jin Chanzi stared at the disappearing figures above the sea and said with a bit of concern in his voice.</p><p>Daoist Zixuan herself looked a bit distracted and in a daze at this moment. She was just faintly in a moment of despair a while ago, yet the sudden arrival of Mo Awu lured the enemy away from them, straightly preventing their impending doom. One thing that made her shocked the most, however, was the sword that was under Mo Awu’s feet.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
