But the intense heat from them caused everyone else to pace back a few steps from her, including her parents, though the little girl didn’t feel any heat at all.</p><p>“Awesome!!!”</p><p>The girl covered her mouth with sparkling eyes. She looked at the sparks of fire fluttering around her from the two flame pigeons as though they were flame spirits.</p><p>The onlookers in the surroundings were shocked as they couldn’t see any props used by Tang Xiu. He only lifted his hands, yet the flames turned into flame pigeons.</p><p>“Mind-blowing! He’s truly able to perform magic!”</p><p>“This guy truly didn’t brag! He’s really awesome.”</p><p>“What marvelous flame doves. They can really fly!”</p><p>“…”</p><p>Eyes staring wide, Li Yan and Yu Xu looked at the dancing flame pigeons in the air with a look of disbelief. Even in their dreams, Tang Xiu being able to perform such magic never came to mind. He was even able to change the flame into flame pigeons without any stage props whatsoever.</p><p>“How did he do that?”</p><p>The same question popped up inside their mind.</p><p>It was likewise the same wonder that swirled in the mind of the magician, Basong. The man looked extremely shocked since he couldn’t see any props that possibly could be used by Tang Xiu. This young man… is truly able to perform magic? It’s like… he had prepared everything in advance and came to snatch the stage!</p><p>With a faint smile hung on his face, Tang Xiu created two bubbles of bluish water under his feet that made him float slowly. When his feet were a meter up from the ground, his fingers flicked and Zhang Xinya suddenly cried out since she was also lifted by two bubbles of water up into Tang Xiu’s arms.</p><p>“Are you afraid?” asked Tang Xiu with a smile.</p><p>Looking at her feet, Zhang Xinya could see that it was not too high and was secretly relieved. Then she shook her head and said, “I’m not.”</p><p>“Well, since you’re not afraid, how about having a dance?” asked Tang Xiu smilingly.</p><p>“What dance? Here?” asked Zhang Xinya.</p><p>Dancing was something Tang Xiu never learned, but he had seen people dancing many times, so he imitated the dancing stance and its steps from his memory and took Zhang Xinya along directly. Zhang Xinya herself danced gracefully while Tang Xiu cooperated according to her movements. Their dance was flowing smoothly as their body’s movements seemed like passing clouds, showing a graceful and breathtaking scene to the audience.</p><p>Shortly after, countless gorgeous flame pigeons came out of nowhere and swirled around them. They constantly changed their formations along with their movement, adorning the air around them to change it into breathtaking and splendid scenery.</p><p>Basong, however, looked exceedingly shocked with his heart pounding hard. Even his eyes looked sparkling at this moment.</p><p>Shock and disbelief were the only feelings that raged inside his heart at the moment!</p><p>Whereas, regarding Li Yan and Yu Xu, they had long been standing dumbstruck and utterly tongue-tied as they watched Tang Xiu and Zhang Xinya dance in the air. They would’ve thought that they were dreaming if they hadn’t just witnessed such a scene with their own two eyes.</p><p>Along with the passing time, people flooded into the vicinity and created a huge crowd. In just half a minute, easily 300 people had come to watch the scene in the sky, many of whom who spoke their mind in shock:</p><p>“God! This is so unbelievable! This scene is what we can only see on TV, no? I never thought that I could see this scene live. So crazy that it’s striking to my eyes!”</p><p>“It’s so breathtakingly gorgeous! I suddenly feel that it’s so unreal. Doesn’t it look like a scene in a fairytale world? How is it possible for any man to do this?”</p><p>“They both wear hats and big sunglasses, but they have lovely statures. They look so graceful and have good chemistry. I… I really want to see what they really look like.”</p><p>“Is this really a magic performance? How come there is such a mysterious magic?</p><p>“There’s no way any world-class magician would be able to perform this kind of gig, right?”</p><p>“This is awesome…”</p><p>“…”</p><p>The performance lasted for several minutes as Tang Xiu floated down to the ground along with Zhang Xinya in his arms. The blobs of bluish water also gradually faded away.</p><p>Tang Xiu raised his head and gently waved his hand, causing the flame pigeons that were dancing in the surrounding air to gently disappear, including the ones around the little girl. Then, he spoke with a light smile, “Ladies and gentlemen, that’s the end of my performance. I hope that everyone loved it.”</p><p>“I like it!”</p><p>“I love it!”</p><p>“Can you perform more?”</p><p>“…”</p><p>Tang Xiu faced the loud praises and requests of the onlookers with just a smile before he turned to look at Li Yan and Yu Xu whose faces were still shocked as he spoke to them, “How about you both? Ashamed with the impulsive to hide yourselves now? Humiliating others is equal to disgracing yourself. We’re all Chinese, so I hope you can conduct yourself well. Don’t ever make a fool of yourself when you go abroad in the future.”</p><p>“I…”</p><p>Both of them opened their mouths but didn’t say anything eventually. They indeed felt that they were exactly like what Tang Xiu said. Their cheeks felt hot like they had just gotten slapped in the face a couple of times. They were not stupid and were naturally able to distinguish that Tang Xiu’s magic performance was much better than the previous magician. It was even more mysterious and magical.</p><p>After shaking his head, Tang Xiu pulled Zhang Xinya to walk away from the crowd.</p><p>Basong’s face, however, looked grim and uncertain. When he saw that the couple was about to leave, he immediately ran and blocked Tang Xiu’s path yet again, calling out, “Who exactly are you? Your… your performance just now was definitely not magic.”</p><p>“Heh, don’t make such an absurd conjecture if you know nothing,” said Tang Xiu indifferently, “You’re a magician, so concern yourself with the gigs you’re performing on the stage instead of finding trouble and pestering your audience. Regardless, I apologize if you think I’ve disturbed your performance, but if you must blame someone, throw your tantrum with those two provocateurs! If it weren’t for them, I wouldn’t have performed in public like that and ruined your stage.”</p><p>“Just tell me, what you just performed was not magic, wasn’t it?” said Basong loudly. “H-how… how did you do it?”</p><p>With his face turned cold, Tang Xiu replied with a question instead of answering him, “Ask yourself. You’ve worked your ass off and bitterly learned your magic tricks; do you want to tell outsiders your techniques and secrets?”</p><p>“I… I can’t….”</p><p>Basong turned pale and was hardly able to answer it.</p><p>“So why bother pursuing me and asking about it since you won’t do it yourself, huh?” sneered Tang Xiu. “Don’t you also know that poking your nose into other magician’s tricks is a taboo thing to do in this industry?”</p><p>The questioning made Basong looked awkward and embarrassed. He lowered his head and said, “I’m sorry. I was wrong.”</p><p>“You know, we Chinese, have a saying that those who can admit their mistakes will be able to reform themselves. It’s one of the most important virtues a person could have, so stop bothering me again since you won’t get anything at all,” continued Tang Xiu. “I won’t bother talking to you again for whatever you have in mind. Goodbye.”</p><p>With that said, he pulled Zhang Xinya to walk past Basong and leave the place quickly.</p><p>Eyes staring at Tang Xiu’s back, Basong murmured, “His performance just now was definitely not magic. There’s no way a magic gig would be that mysterious. But who exactly is he and how did he do it?”</p><p>A middle-aged man who stood very close to him asked with curiosity, “Is what you just said true? What he did is not a magic gig?”</p><p>“Absolutely not!” Basong shook his head and said, “Although I don’t how he did it, it was definitely not magic. Magic performances require a stage set, but he didn’t use any of them whatsoever.”</p><p>“He couldn’t be a celestial-like being, could he be?” exclaimed the middle-aged man.</p><p>A celestial being?</p><p>Basong’s lips squirmed and he finally replied with a bitter face, “Perhaps he can only be described as a celestial being indeed.”</p><p>“Goddammit! How come I was as stupid as a pig? Such a stunning scene, yet I forgot to take a video with my smartphone?”</p><p>“Darn right you are! I’m truly an idiot myself. If I videoed the scene just now and sent it to my friends, I’m hella sure it would create a huge sensation.”</p><p>“It’s really a pity. No photos and no videos?!”</p><p>“it’s… it’s that guy’s fault. Blame him for his magical performance! It was too amazing and beautiful, making me forget to do that…”</p><p>“…”</p><p>In a corner behind the crowd was a young man holding a smartphone. He was looking towards the direction where Tang Xiu and Zhang Xinya left in a daze until the shouts from the onlookers around him pulled him back to reality. He then looked at a group of people screaming with a vexed expression and rolled his eyes. Only then did he realize something, so he suddenly shouted out loudly, “I recorded the scene, everyone! If you want it, you can come here and buy it. 10… no, 100 dollar and you’ll have it!”</p><p>“Someone recorded it? I’ll buy it!”</p><p>“I’ll buy!”</p><p>“Me too!”</p><p>“…”</p><p>In just ten minutes or so, hundreds of people bought the video. The young man excitedly transferred the video to the people around him while constantly stuffing hundred-dollar bills into his pocket.</p><p>“Hehe… I got more than 10 grand.”</p><p>Tang Xiu himself was unaware that his and Zhang Xinya’s performance was recorded, nor did he know that this guy sold the footage and earned more than 10,000 dollars in just 10 minutes. He and Zhang Xinya didn’t go far after they left that place and just entered a nearby shopping mall.</p><p>There, they literally bought all the famous brand goods, as well as ordinary articles, in a happy and joyous mood. Despite being someone who didn’t like spending money extravagantly, Tang Xiu still poured out his money with Zhang Xinya. Certainly, it was also because every floor had different stuff. It was not until the couple entered the city’s special food court did their shopping spree come to an end.</p><p>As they came back to the hotel, Zhang Xinya was completely exhausted, while Tang Xiu likewise felt slightly weary. Just as Zhang Xinya slumped down on the sofa drained, however, he exercised his masterful technique to use the Tuina massage on her and made her weariness gradually disappear.</p><p>“You’re really amazing, Tang Xiu!” She groaned softly while enjoying the comfort of her body.</p><p>“Amazing?” Tang Xiu smiled and asked, “In what aspect are you talking about, though?”</p><p>“What aspect?” asked Zhang Xinya, looking puzzled.</p><p>Tang Xiu stopped massaging her and picked her up onto his lap. He brought her to the bedroom while grinning, “You know, telling a man that he’s amazing in a particular aspect refers to the stuff we’re going to do shortly. Don’t worry, though! I’ll wholeheartedly do my best to serve you and let you…”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
