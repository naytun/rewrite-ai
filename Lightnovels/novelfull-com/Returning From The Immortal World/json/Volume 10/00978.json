It could also unclog the energy channels in the meridians and activate all the key points and other significant effects, such as regulating the nerves and bodily functions that governed the immune system, promoting visceral health and beautifying one’s skin. Certainly, the principal effect it brought was to improve blood circulation, eliminating fatigue and improving one’s capacity to exercise.</p><p>Wen Jing’s physical condition was such that her bodily functions had deteriorated so much that the cells inside her body had been constantly devoured by the cancer cells, causing her physical condition to drop into an abysmal state. It was best to improve the condition of her physique first before any treatment began, that way her body would be able to endure the treatment.</p><p>The various techniques of Tuina Massage that are used in the process of massage are intended to stimulate the meridians and acupoints in one’s body, even just a specific section of them. There are more than 100 kinds of techniques, but the most commonly used ones are only four kinds: pressing-based, kneading-based, pushing-based, and holding-based ones. There are also some other techniques that are mainly based on rubbing, such as flat-pushing, rolling, and rubbing techniques, whereas some other techniques involve body shaking like patting, tapping or shaking, and so on. Other than those, there are also techniques to exercise and move the joints between limbs like cracking, pulling and turning, as well as stretching and so on.</p><p>Tang Xiu’s tuina massage therapy did not consist of a single technique, but instead was a combination of dozens of massage techniques that ultimately formed a unique massage therapy. Regardless of the duration of the massage, the movement and strength that were applied constantly changed according to the various techniques being applied.</p><p>The limbs and the waist were the parts that Tang Xiu mainly massaged. As he found that Wen Jing was drowsy, the look of pain on her face that was previously hard to conceal also gradually disappeared. He immediately released his Primal Chaos power to wrap her limbs and waist and lifted her up several meters, turning over her body extremely quickly to lay her down on the massage table.</p><p>Feet, legs, hips, waist, back, arms, neck and head.</p><p>Tang Xiu secretly released his Primal Chaos power to circulate in her meridians and determine every acupoint all over Wen Jing’s body, strengthening them to the utmost while nourishing them with his power secretly. The sleepy Wen Jing was deeply drowning in an unspeakable yet comfortable state, so much so that she didn’t even realize that she lightly moaned during the continuous technique applied by Tang Xiu.</p><p>After half an hour, Tang Xiu stopped massaging and took out silver needles box from his interspatial ring. Despite the obstruction from the clothes worn by Wen Jing, every silver needle was accurately inserted into several important acupoints all over her body.</p><p>The process of invigorating and nourishing the blood followed every breath, as Tang Xiu sent a wisp of his Primal Chaos power into every silver needle applied to the acupoints over Wen Jing’s body. After he was done applying them, he held her arm and checked her pulse with his finger while slowly pouring his power into her meridians.</p><p>Speaking in another sense, the human body could be said to be a net, while energy acted like its wire. Intricate energy lines were being waved by his Primal Chaos power, along with the meridian network inside Wen jing’s body, stretching into her four limbs and five main internal organs.</p><p>This washing process was applied to remove the cancer cells in her body and slowly force them out of her system. Due to her frail physical state, it was necessary for Tang Xiu to spend a great amount of energy and work towards an early stage of treatment since he didn’t dare to use much power than needed. His only option was to slowly eliminate the cancer cells and then discharge them by applying this cleaning method step by step.</p><p>Time fleeted by, and Song Xian continued waiting outside the room in restlessness. He had even stopped his younger brother, Song Yang, from going in several times already. He did hear from his father that Tang Xiu was a young man with outstanding skills. Therefore, although he didn’t believe that Tang Xiu would be able to cure his mother of cancer, he was still able to hold himself back while feeling restless.</p><p>“Be careful, Brother! You stop me again and you’ll face my rage!” roared Song Yang with a furious face.</p><p>“Song Yang, you gotta remember that this world is so big. Countless strange phenomenon and things can exist and occur,” said Song Xiang with a heavy voice, “We don’t know much about Tang Xiu and nobody can guarantee that he’s not one of those people with bizarre abilities. You also clearly know about Mom’s illness. I don’t give a damn about what kind of means are used. We must attempt everything to cure her, even if our efforts fail again and again.”</p><p>“Can’t you see that fucking man surnamed Tang is nothing but a shit conman?” angrily shouted Song Yang. “Have you ever seen any Chinese medicine practitioner as young as him? That punk must be just a braggart if you ask me. There’s no way he has such a skill!”</p><p>“Heh, how do you know if he doesn’t have it?” sneered Song Xiang. “It’s not something we can conclude yet. Besides, to me, he’s much better than you in some respects.”</p><p>“Better than me?” Song Yang clenched his fists and angrily asked, “I dare you to tell me in which aspects he’s better than me?”</p><p>“If I remember correctly from what Dad told me about his identity, he’s the Big Boss of the Magnificent Tang Corporation in China. Yet, he founded his company without using any power or connections the Tang Family has,” said Song Xiang. “Now you tell me. Do you have what it takes to establish anything that can compare to his company with your own skill, huh? Can you earn hundreds of millions of dollars in such a short time like him?”</p><p>“This…”</p><p>The argument made Song Yang’s anger subside. He opened his mouth, but found himself unable to retort. He didn’t know about Tang Xiu, but he at least knew about the Magnificent Tang Corporation and that Tang Xiu was its founder.</p><p>“Tang Xiu also has another identity. He’s hailed as the Young Divine Doctor in the Chinese medical field,” added Song Xiang with a solemn face. “I dunno whether it’s true or not, but you can check it on the internet. There should be reports about him on the Internet if he’s really famous.”</p><p>‘The Young Divine Doctor, heh?’</p><p>Song Yang snorted in contempt, but still swiftly took out his smartphone and quickly searched for “Young Divine Doctor Tang Xiu”. In just a few seconds, the contemptuous look on his face a moment ago instantly froze and his eyes turned round, nearly bulging out of their sockets.</p><p>“What’s wrong?”</p><p>Upon seeing his younger brother’s expression, Song Xiang looked puzzled and reached out to snatch Song Yang’s smartphone. As he took a fast glance at the screen, a look of disbelief and incredulity covered his face since there were so many articles about Tang Xiu on the Internet, especially regarding his identity as a miracle-working doctor who had saved patients and cured their disease. There was a lot of hype and praises about him, hailing him as the reincarnation of Bian Que and the living Hua Tuo.</p><p>“No way. Could it be that all these reports on the Internet are real?” muttered Song Yang with a somewhat strange voice, “He… he really excels in Chinese medicine? But… but how is this possible?”</p><p>Song Xiang standing next to him was also shocked, yet there was also a happy expression on his face. He said in a deep voice, “I told you nothing in human life can be predicted so easily, and to never judge someone based on their appearance, didn’t I? Have you forgotten the old adage that says that men cannot be judged by their looks and that you can’t measure the ocean with a bushel? He comes from China—a country with more than a billion people, where hidden dragons and crouching tigers have always appeared for countless generations. Maybe Tang Xiu really has an extraordinary talent in traditional Chinese medicine.”</p><p>Song Yang snatched back his smartphone and swiped the screen with his finger to read the news, continuing his search for more information. Only after a long time did he finally stop and heave a sigh of relief. At this time, however, there was no longer anger on his face, but an embarrassed expression instead as he let out a dry smile and said, “What you said may be right, Big Brother. It is I who looked down on him.”</p><p>A smile was now worn on Song Xiang’s face and he nodded. “Regardless of the outcome of whether he is able to cure our mother or not, you owe him an apology. Let alone that he did it out of goodwill, just the fact that he’s the son of Uncle Tang is a must for us not to have a fight with him, got it?”</p><p>“I’ll behave and be more polite to him later,” replied Song Yang. “But if he can really cure Mom, let alone apologize, I’ll pull out my own heart if he wants it. I’ll never apologize to him if he can’t cure her!”</p><p>His response made Song Xian frown. But, as he was about to rebuke him, his nostrils suddenly twitched a few times and he looked at the other end of the corridor and said with a confused face, “Where does this stench come from?”</p><p>Song Yang also smelled the stench and then pointed to the massage room’s door and said, “This stench seems to be drifting out from that room. But… it’s strange, though. The housemaid usually cleans the massage room very deeply, and there’s nothing rotten there either. How can this stench come from there?”</p><p>The two men exchanged glances and their expressions suddenly changed as they dashed nearly at the same time toward the door and pushed it open.</p><p>Cough, cough….</p><p>A putrid stench burst out and greeted them, catching the two brothers off guard and causing them to choke and cough at the same time.</p><p>At the same time, Tang Xiu was standing by the massage bed. He turned around and saw Song Xiang and Song Yang coming in. Upon seeing their choking and miserable expressions, he immediately let out a smile and said, “I told you not to come inside, didn’t I? Yet you ignored it. Did you really doubt me and worry about my treatment perhaps?”</p><p>Song Xiang stopped coughing and held back the overwhelming nausea in his stomach. His eyes moved from Tang Xiu to his mother on the massage bed, only to notice that his mother’s clothes were drenched, while a dark and sticky grayish-black substance was covering her exposed skin. That grayish-black substance was the culprit of this putrid stench.</p><p>“Tang… Tang Xiu brother, how is my Mom?”</p><p>“The treatment process has been applied smoothly, but it’s not done yet,” said Tang Xiu with a smile. “Well, if you both can ignore the smell, then you can stay here and watch. But remember; do not disturb me. Of course, you can just leave the room and wait outside if you can’t stand the smell in the room.”</p><p>Song Yang firmly pressed his nostrils and looked at Tang Xiu’s calm expression. Strong admiration now birthed inside his heart. The pungent stench in the room was so unbearable that he felt like he couldn’t stay inside for even a minute, yet Tang Xiu seemed to not be disturbed by it whatsoever. Just this willpower was something he couldn’t compare with him.</p><p>“Damn. You’re amazing.”</p><p>He used his other hand to raise his thumb before turning around and rushing outside.</p><p>Song Xiang himself held his breath, but the stench still kept drilling in his nostrils. He wanted to stay inside to see Tang Xiu treat his mother, but the pungent smell irritated his nostrils too much, making eyes turn watery. He could only choose to go back outside, but quickly remarked before he left, “Thanks a bunch, Brother. I leave Mom in your hands.”</p><p>“Let’s spare all the polite chit-chat, shall we? I’ll definitely do my best.” Tang Xiu waved and smilingly said, “Also, remember to close the door when you’re outside and keep anyone from coming in. I’m afraid that they will disturb my treatment process.”</p><p>“Got it!” replied Song Xiang without hesitation. He then closed the door with his backhand.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
