He never said to save you. The victor takes all the rights, and the loser takes the blame. You’re the loser in the power struggle of the clan, so we have the rights to abandon you. Singluen, can we leave now?”</p><p>Singluen was pleasantly surprised. He grinned and said, “Alright, you can leave immediately. Also, you can expect that all the words I’ve spoken just now will always be effective. As long as I become the Dark Shaman Clan’s Patriarch, you deserve to get a just treatment, and I’ll lead you to develop our clan!”</p><p>A smile outlined on Tang Xiu’s mouth as he ordered with a deep voice, “Deactivate the sword array and let them leave!”</p><p>Soon after, the black mist gradually dissipated and the 13 Shaman Guardians directly left silently with a look of indifference. Singkuo, however, instantly dashed toward the distance right at this moment. He decisively attempted to blaze a bloody path forward even though there were Xue Sha and Hei Xion in his path.</p><p>“The struggle of a trapped beast is futile.”</p><p>There was no sympathy on Tang Xiu’s indifferent face as he watched Singkuo try to break through the encirclement from Xue Sha and Hei Xiong. He was in line with the statement of the Shaman Guardian’s captain that the victor is the law and the loser becomes an outlaw. Singkuo had aggressively led a lot of men to kill Singluen, so he needed to be prepared for failure and death as well.</p><p>In this world, the principle of survival is cruel and brutal.</p><p>A few kilometers away from the spot, atop the tens of meters high water tower, Zuo Daquan’s eyes filled with a sympathetic gaze upon seeing Singkuo’s predicament. He shook his head and sighed, “Who could’ve imagined that such a tragic end has come to a formerly powerful man? He had the world under his feet and is exceptionally adept in schemes. I guess nothing is truly absolute in human affairs in this world. I suddenly feel that being an ordinary person is a much better fate.”</p><p>A middle-aged man next to him replied with a face of approval, “You’re right, Boss. Those who resort to murder will end up being killed. Singkuo took so many powerful men and aggressively came here to kill others, yet the wheel of fortune reversed and he got himself trapped in the well-designed scheme devised by the other party. I’m now sure that the mastermind who laid the trap is Mr. Tang. Also, this victory is not a single win at all, but kind of killing two birds with one stone.”</p><p>“Huh?” Zuo Daquan looked vacant for a moment and asked with a puzzled expression, “What do you mean by killing two birds with one stone?”</p><p>“Well, our coconut plantation is just destroyed like this, Boss. Don’t you think that he’s killing two sides with only one arrow? He has just retaliated against us, no?”</p><p>Cough, cough….</p><p>Zuo Daquan coughed and raised his hand. A look of embarrassment could be seen on his face as he touched his nose and was unable to speak anything.</p><p>Suddenly, another middle-aged man standing behind him had his face slightly changed, and he said with a quaint expression, “There’s a lot in this matter; at least more than meets the eye, Boss. What we just saw should be the first half of the play, whereas the most thrilling scene should be coming up later.”</p><p>“Singkuo is isolated and acts as a loner now. How is there any chance for any following scene to come up?” argued Zuo Daquan with a bitter smile. “Well, I can only pray that they’ll leave earlier now. I will otherwise lose a lot more should they accidentally find the gold stored under the rubble.”</p><p>“Take a look at the right side, Boss,” exclaimed the man behind him. “The road next to the river.”</p><p>Zuo Daquan was stunned for a moment before shifting his sight to the right side. A look of surprise showed itself on his face as he muttered, “Some more people are heading here? Is this matter not over yet?”</p><p>“I don’t think this will be over just like this, Boss,” said the middle-aged man. “Take a look at them, quickly! Those cars that have now stopped there! Oh my god. Their movement is so fast. It looks like… they’re even faster than ghosts! I can only catch their afterimages. It will only take them half a minute to arrive at our coconut plantation.”</p><p>In the coconut plantation.</p><p>Singkuo had used all the trump cards he had, yet he was still unable to shake off Xue Sha and He Xiong. The sword formation formed by their immortal swords completely suppressed him and kept creating wounds on his body. In just a minute or so, he had turned into a bloodied man, looking like he had just crawled out of a river of blood. If he remained stranded in this situation, it was absolutely impossible for him to endure another minute. He would be doomed to his death by Xue Sha and Hei Shiong.</p><p>“Who are you?!”</p><p>Tang Xiu’s complexion changed all of a sudden and he instantly unleashed his divine sword. At the same time, his figure flew up into the sky and unleashed dozens of sword lights toward the spot behind the ruined buildings dozens of meters away.</p><p>“Heh, what a laughable attempt.”</p><p>A hoarse and old voice came from behind the rubble. A string of black Buddhist beads raised upward, their size magnified dozens of times in an instant and blocking the sword lights unleashed by Tang Xiu. However, several beads on the Buddhist necklace then suddenly exploded and shattered the moment after.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>Eight shadows flickered and instantly appeared in front of Xue Sha and Hei Xiong. Afterwards, numerous darts shot at them from all directions, causing Xue Sha and Hei Xiong to retreat dozens of meters away. They staggeringly retrieved back their immortal swords before appearing next to Tang Xiu. Singkuo, who had been previously besieged by them, was now being tied by two black chains on his arms as two handsome Caucasian men in black tuxedos towed him away.</p><p>“Well, well. You look very miserable, Young Master Singkuo.”</p><p>A monk with nine burn marks on his forehead, decked out in a Buddhist robe while holding a golden Buddhist staff, spoke with a smile. The string of Buddhist beads he used to block Tang Xiu’s sword had flown back to his hands. This monk looked very old, humpbacked and with a faint aura; yet, it was this faint aura that made Tang Xiu feel a bit apprehensive secretly.</p><p>Upon seeing this person, an intense desire for survival appeared on Singkuo’s despaired face. He hurriedly shouted, “Death Dhyana Buddhist Master, Vajra Rakshasha, save me and I’ll agree to your previous condition to join the Stygian Club! If you can help kill Singluen, Tang Xiu, and all of them, I’ll also bring the entire Dark Shaman Clan to be your vassal after I become its Patriarch!”</p><p>Tens of meters away from them, Tang Xiu shot a vigilant glance at the eight people who just appeared. Their appearance was very different from that of average people. For instance, Death Dhyana Buddhist Master’s thin figure was like a skeleton, looking so ancient and bizarre with his humpback, yet it gave off a more fearsome vibe than shamans and wizards usually gave off.</p><p>Next to this monk stood a huge man built like an iron tower. He was nearly twice the height of an adult man—over four meters high. The giant had bronze skin with iron chains wrapping his body. He gave off an enormous suppressing aura, like that of a beast from ancient times. Tang Xiu, who previously thought that Mo Awu was a burly giant, now thought he seemed to be a dwarf who paled in comparison to this mammoth of a man.</p><p>The other six people apart included two handsome Caucasian men that looked like vampires, a white-haired woman with a ruddy and frail complexion, a tall man who wore female clothes and thick make-up that made him look demonic, a long-haired young man with a cross on his back and outlandish attire, and a black woman with iron rings piercing her nostrils, ears, and eyebrows.</p><p>All of them, without a doubt, were far from being average people. It was very likely that they were also formidable people.</p><p>The Death Dhyana Buddhist Master still wore a faint smile. He circled around Singkuo a few times before sighing, “Well, we kindly offered you the invitation, didn’t we? Yet you ended up declining it with all sorts of excuses. Now that you’re facing an imminent disaster, you want to rely on our power, huh? Young Master Singkuo, how can such a good thing happen in this world?”</p><p>“I’m willing to join you with my position as the Dark Shaman Clan’s Patriarch!” replied Singkuo hurriedly. “I’ll bring the entire Dark Shaman Clan to work for you in the future. Isn’t that enough?”</p><p>“Enough? Of course, that is sufficient.” Death Dhyana Buddhist Master raised his hand while his thumb kept pressing on the beads of his necklace. “However, I’ve seen too many people burn the bridge after crossing it. There’s a little price you must pay if you want us to fully trust you.”</p><p>Singkuo’s face slightly changed, and he asked in a deep voice, “What price must I pay?”</p><p>The monk took out a black porcelain bottle from the sleeve of his robe. He then threw it to Singkuo and said, “There’s a Death Zen Pill I concocted in there. You can say that it’s a very potent poison pill. If you dare take this pill, we’ll move to save you. We can even help you to take over the Patriarch seat of your clan.”</p><p>The Death Zen Pill?!</p><p>At this moment, a look of dread filled Singkuo’s eyes. He knew that this pill was used by Death Dhyana Buddhist Master to control the life and death of those who took it. Those who took it must obey his order and could only obtain the antidote from him every six months to guarantee their own life and safety temporarily. If they dare to go against his order, not only would they be barred from obtaining the antidote, they would also be miserably tortured by the violent poison for a very long time until they died.</p><p>It was simply vicious and ruthless!</p><p>He couldn’t imagine what his fate would be like if he were to take the Death Zen Pill.</p><p>With a cold expression, Death Dhyana Buddhist Master asked lightly, “What’s wrong? You don’t dare to take it?”</p><p>Singkuo turned his head to look at Tang Xiu and Singluen. His sight then shifted to the rest of his enemies in front, saying with gritted teeth, “I’m going to die. It’s inevitable. No matter how unwilling I am, I have no other option left to preserve my life. You’ve given me the chance, so I’ll take your pill. To live is always better than to die. As long as I’m alive, I can make my enemies pay the most painful and terrible price later.”</p><p>“Che, are you sure they can preserve your life, Singkuo?” sneered Tang Xiu with squinted eyes.</p><p>Singkuo shot a stare again at Tang Xiu and fiercely replied, “I’m sure, so damn fucking sure! They are the top eight assassins of the Stygian Club—fearsome figures at the peak of the totem pole among the rest. If they can’t save me, that means you’d be able to enact your hegemony over the world. Just wait, Tang Xiu. I’ll definitely able to kill you one day. At that time, you won’t be dying alone, but all your loved ones will also meet a tragic and cruel death. I’ll mercilessly slaughter your friends and all the people you care about. I’ll make sure to make every one of their souls vanish into nothingness and never reincarnate!!!”</p><p>In that instant, killing intent seethed and boiled in Tang Xu’s heart. Touching his friends and relatives crossed a line. Whoever dared to have such a thought must die thoroughly and have no chance to be reincarnated.</p><p>“Singkuo, you only need to die and then you can be free. That was the original intention. But now, I’ll make sure to make you completely vanish from this world! The Stygian Club, huh?! Hmph… I’ve killed a lot of them; I don’t mind exterminating eight more!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
