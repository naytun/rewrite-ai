If your father indeed acts against you, then you must be prepared for the next thing we’re going to face—your entire clan.”</p><p>“No. I don’t believe my father will act to strike me personally.” Singluen shook his head. “My position in his heart may not be as high as my big brother, but I’m sure he still cares a lot about me.”</p><p>“Let’s hope so.” Tang Xiu was cautious and said, “However, we still have to be prepared to guard against any attack from the forces under your Dark Shaman clan after returning to Thailand. It seems the previous plan to go back there openly must change.”</p><p>“What plan?” asked Singluen with a changed expression.</p><p>His question was not answered by Tang Xiu, who instead looked at Tang Guang and ordered, “Find a way to contact Snakehead to sneak us into Bangkok from Saipan. You and An will go with me. Tell Awu and the rest to find a way to follow us on their own.”</p><p>“I’ll arrange it immediately.” Tang Guang nodded.</p><p>As noon came, two off-road cars quickly headed for the port, rumored as a property of the fourth powerful figure in Saipan. The port was a small, but it still had several cargo ships anchored there.</p><p>At present, more than a dozen black-suited middle-aged men with sunglasses stood around a black youth standing by several off-road cars. The youth was talking to a lean man wearing a long robe with a flower pattern and a cap, yet their exchange looked icy and tense.</p><p>“We’ll sail 15 minutes from now. I don’t give a fuck who you are. The schedule has been set and that’s it. Find yourself other means to leave here if you don’t like it.”</p><p>“I’ll transfer 1 million dollars to your account if you set sail now,” said the black young man in fluent English.</p><p>A look of greed flashed in the thin middle-aged man’s eyes, but it was soon replaced by hesitation as he stubbornly shook his head. “No. This is our rule and I can’t break it. What’s more, your group is not the only guest we have. There are some other groups, so wait for them before we set sail.”</p><p>His response made the black youth spit out curses. The dozen stalwart men around him quickly pulled out their pistols and aimed at the thin middle-aged man. Right as their muzzles were aimed at him, however, a group of people looking like simple fishermen appeared all of a sudden. These men and women emitted out intense killing aura. Each of them was armed with submachine guns and rifles, while the stalwart men had only pistols.</p><p>Upon realizing the situation, the black youth immediately raised his hand and said, “Alright! You won buddy! Just hope that we won’t bump into each other again in the future.”</p><p>With that said, he led a dozen strongmen and quickly boarded the nearest cargo ship.</p><p>Tang Guang, who had been following Tang Xiu, watched the scene in front with a contemptuous look, whispering, “That’s just a frequent scene we’ll see among smugglers, Boss. Some who are lucky will reach their destination, but those with bad luck will only get robbed and thrown into the sea as corpses. It seems like we’re about to get some tough guys this time.”</p><p>“Do you think they are tough?” asked Tang Xiu.</p><p>“Nah. Not to us, but to average people, yes.” Tang Guang shook his head and added, “For laymen, those guys are very hard to deal with, especially those who just boarded the ship. They should have killed many people in the past.”</p><p>“There’s no need for us to complicate things.” Tang Xiu nodded. “We just need to arrive in Bangkok secretly. If they don’t provoke us, just ignore them unless they wanna court death.”</p><p>“I understand.” Tang Guang nodded.</p><p>Quickly after, Tang Xiu’s group of nine came to the front of the thin man. Tang Guang quickly made several gestures to him and then paced forward and said, “I already transferred the money to your account this morning. My group’s code is Shadow of Ghost.”</p><p>“No need to speak much since you already know the procedure.” The middle-aged man looked at the group and said, “But keep in mind to obey our arrangements along the journey, lest you want to face us. Alright, get on board! We’ll set sail in ten minutes.”</p><p>“There’s another thing I wanna know,” said Tang Guang. “How many people are you smuggling this time?”</p><p>The lean man looked at Tang Guang with a slightly surprised expression and grinned, “Well, well. It seems like I’m facing a group who has been in the business for a long time, huh? Alright, there’s no harm in telling you, though. We already got 40 souls with us going to Bangkok this time; combined with you lot, it will be almost 50 in total. But you gotta be careful, dude. Those shits who just boarded the ship are no saints. We’ll do nothing if you get into a conflict with them along the journey.”</p><p>“Roger that,” said Tang Guang.</p><p>A little bit later, everyone had boarded the cargo ship. The ship was very dirty, and one could see garbage and dirt everywhere, along with tons of scattered goods all over. As everyone entered the ship, they could all smell a faint stench from the cabin. The situation inside was abysmal, with people scattered among the goods in groups of three to five, although there were also groups with seven or eight people.</p><p>Furthermore, old and young men and women were also seen on the ship. The most noticeable was a young, ordinary-looking woman with braided hair and two mixed-race children not much older than seven in tow.</p><p>Tang Guang flipped his hand and took out a dagger as he strode to the inside corner. He glared at the three men sitting there and coldly said, “Scram. This spot is ours.”</p><p>The three men looked at Tang Xiu and Singluen’s group and quickly exchanged glances before standing up to hide elsewhere.</p><p>Tang Xiu just let out a faint smile. When he passed by the woman, he threw a few candies to the two children and then went to the corner to sit down.</p><p>Afterward, several other small groups of smugglers came aboard, each group with four people at the most, including group of two and a lone traveler.</p><p>10 minutes later, the thin middle-aged guy came in from the outside with two young men armed with submachine guns. The former glanced coldly around the cabin and loudly said, “Welcome aboard, everyone. It’s an honor to have you all aboard. I’m Mark, the Head of Snakehead. I’ll tell you all in advance about the journey. We’re going to stop by an island midway; there, other ships will pick you up and bring you to your destination. One thing you must do is obey the rules on my ship. For those who dare to cause trouble, I warn you that the gun in my hands will deal with you no matter who you are.”</p><p>The ship then started cruising.</p><p>A few hours later, the ship had cruised further a ways away from Saipan. There was nothing to be seen but the endless blue ocean. It was the afternoon and the sun was very bright, sending its warmness and comfortable light into the cabin through the window.</p><p>“I’m hungry, Mom,” a feeble voice drifted over from afar.</p><p>Tang Xiu looked at the source of the voice and saw the boy on the left side of the woman, stroking his belly.</p><p>The woman gritted her teeth, tears visibly hanging on her eyelids. She reached out to hug the little boy and whispered, “Little Bu dear, Mom didn’t bring any food this time since we were in a hurry to leave. Please endure it for some time. Mom will immediately buy some meals for you once we arrive in Bangkok.”</p><p>Despite his disappointment, the little boy nodded silently.</p><p>Tang Xiu sighed inwardly. He put his hand into his clothes’ pocket and secretly took out three bars of chocolate from his interspatial ring. Then, he stretched out his hand to throw them over to the mother and children, saying faintly, “Adults can endure hunger, but growing children can’t. Hearing you speak, you are from China, aren’t you?”</p><p>With a slightly changed expression, a look of vigilance could be seen on Zuo Qing’s face. She shot a deep look at Tang Xiu before picking up the chocolate bars in front of her to give to the two children. “Thank you. We’re indeed Chinese.”</p><p>Tang Xiu just nodded in response and didn’t speak again.</p><p>At this time, the black youth looked at Tang Xiu before he shifted his attention to the woman and her children. He suddenly whispered to the men around him. Two ferocious-looking Caucasian big men then came to the mother and children and quickly snatched the chocolate bars in the children’s hands and then walked back to give them to the black youth.</p><p>Tang Xiu knitted his brows and looked at the two children. Their faces were scowling, but they didn’t dare to speak. Tang Xiu then shifted his eyes to the black youth and faintly said, “Give it back to those children and I’ll let this go. Otherwise, you can expect to end up miserable!”</p><p>The black young man looked at Tang Xiu and his men while also observing Singluo’s group, especially the five white-haired old men and the feminine, delicate woman. He suddenly said to his men, “I fucking hate those who threaten me. Go and grab all the food they have. Give them some bullets should they dare to refuse, and throw their corpses to feed the sea critters.”</p><p>“Got it!”</p><p>Four big men then pulled out their pistols and hideously grinned as they walked over to Tang Xiu’s group.</p><p>Seeing the four big men walking over with guns in their hands, Zuo Qing’s pupils contracted and fear was evident in her eyes. However, just as those four big men were about to arrive in front of Tang Xiu’s group, she immediately shouted, “Please don’t disturb them. We don’t want that chocolate!”</p><p>“Shut the fuck up, BITCH!”</p><p>A big man turned his head and ferociously glared at Zuo Qing, cursing her.</p><p>SLAP!</p><p>A loud slap was heard in the cabin as Tang Guang moved lightning-fast, striking with his palm to slap and kick the strongman’s chest, sending him flying seven-plus meters backwards to heavily smash against a pile of goods. He then coldly shouted, “Your fucking guns are nothing to those who are truly strong. You deserve to be killed for going against my Grand Master!”</p><p>“FUCKING ASSHOLE!”</p><p>The other three strongmen had enormously changed faces. They instantly unlocked their guns’ safety locks and aimed the muzzles at Tang Guang with fury. Just as they were about to pull the trigger, however, the dagger that circled around Tang Guang’s hand instantly swept over their necks, followed by a swift kick. Blood splattered, and their dead bodies flung several metes backwards before heavily slamming against the floor.</p><p>Tang Xiu saw that Zuo Qing quickly covered the two children’s eyes and indifferently said, “You shouldn’t have used such bloody means in front of children, Guang. Throw their bodies outside and directly neutralize those who try to stop you!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
