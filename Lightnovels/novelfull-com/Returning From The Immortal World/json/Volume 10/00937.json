He would never start any fight with anyone should they not attack him first. While he was too lazy to care about such an insignificant person like Yang Yang, unexpectedly, this fella couldn’t see eye to eye with him and directly attacked.</p><p>“SCRAM…”</p><p>With a seemingly light punch, he directly clashed with Yang Yang’s fist. The sound of broken bones was heard, along with Yang Yang’s scream. His entire arm was instantly broken and twisted. His body was flung backward under the huge impact and heavily slammed on the concrete pavement seven-plus meters away.</p><p>Wang Wei’s pupils shrunk with a burst of a horrified look. He knew Yang Yang’s strength; on that point, he had to admit that he himself was much inferior. So he never imagined that the clash of fists between them ended up in the immediate defeat of Yang Yang, and so badly at that.</p><p>With fear breeding in his heart, he sprinted to Yang Yang’s side, propping him to sit down and asking with concern, “Are you alright?”</p><p>Yang Yang shot a disbelieving look towards Tang Xiu as though he just saw a ghost in broad daylight. He was quite formidable himself; even though he couldn’t compare to those martial art grandmasters, average martial arts experts were not his match.</p><p>And yet! He got defeated just like that?!</p><p>Tang Xiu disdainfully looked at him and apathetically said, “I didn’t even use all my strength when I killed Amur Tiger last year. And your strength? You lost so pathetically that you are not even qualified to make me use even 1% of what I’m capable of. I was originally too lazy to pay attention to such a nobody like you. I just didn’t expect that you’re really so ignorant and reckless.”</p><p>The Amur Tiger?</p><p>Yang Yang was dumbfounded. He suddenly realized something, and while suppressing the piercing pain in his fist and arm, he struggled to crawl up from the ground and hurriedly called out, “Was it you who killed the Amur Tiger? That’s impossible! Absolutely impossible! The one who killed him is Beijing’s Tang…”</p><p>At his point, his expression froze and his body shivered…</p><p>Of all the ancient martial arts clans in the country, who among them didn’t know how terrifying the Amur Tiger was? Well-known rumors had it that the Amur Tiger was not even a martial artist! He was a cultivator! And yet, the rumor that the long-lived Amur Tiger whose formidable strength literally shook everyone under the sun was killed in Beijing already spread out to those who were concerned.</p><p>It was the Tang Family of Beijing!</p><p>Yang Yang couldn’t remember it just a moment ago, so he held no fear to those families in the capital. But as he recalled the matter regarding the Amur Tiger being killed, he was literally frozen. It was as if his whole being was falling into a hole inside a glacier. After all, ancient martial arts clans would probably dare to pick a fight with any family save the Tang Family of Beijing.</p><p>He still vividly remembered what his father once told him:</p><p>“If my guess is correct, the Tang Family of Beijing must have a very powerful expert, and this person should be a Daoist cultivator. If he’s not, then his martial arts mastery has reached a very terrifying level. I’m afraid that this person is also able to completely eradicate our family.”</p><p>Not even in his dreams did Yang Yang ever imagine that the expert his father had appraised was actually this 21 something young man in front of him.</p><p>Wang Wei, however, didn’t know all of this. He just saw that his brother was hit badly. Although he knew that he was not Tang Xiu’s match at all, he still angrily looked up with a furious face and growled, “Friend, aren’t you just too ruthless? You just wasted his arm! Don’t you also know what this means to a martial artist?”</p><p>“Hmph,” sneered Tang Xiu. “If I were just an average person and not very strong myself, his punch should’ve taken half my life out. I only broke his arm, which was already mercy on him, no?”</p><p>“This…”</p><p>The answer made Wang Wei unable to retort this time. He was well aware of Yang Yang’s strength and he knew that Tang Xiu was right. It was Yang Yang who attacked him first in his fury and didn’t show mercy at all.</p><p>Being disgusted with both of them, Tang Xiu waved and said, “Get the hell out of this place! Don’t think you can rely on your pathetic kung fu and your family’s background before me. But I’m not that ruthless a man and I’m not in the mood to bicker with you. Else, let alone you all, even your family will be implicated.”</p><p>“You’re very strong indeed, but it’s still worse than your mouth!” Wang Wei yelled again angrily, “We’ll bump into each other again and see what happens later!”</p><p>“Stupid!”</p><p>Tang Xiu shook his head. He didn’t want to bother to even look at them anymore, so he just took Ouyang Lulu to head inside the villa. The incident was just a trivial episode that had close to no influence on him. But to prevent the issue bothering him in the future, he still must investigate Yang Yang’s family background. If they still dared to annoy him again, he would make them learn a lesson at the worst.</p><p>“Lulu, don’t forget to tell Xiaoxue to send some men to visit the Yang Family and give them some shock and fright. They can kick their martial hall plaque. That’s right, just use that custom.”</p><p>“Do you perhaps want to make the Yangs lose face in the ancient martial arts clan circle?” asked Ouyang Lulu.</p><p>“Don’t you think that losing face is much better than the whole family being destroyed?” asked Tang Xiu back. “Besides, I may have just ruined a certain family in Ning City last night.”</p><p>Ouyang Lulu curled her lips, apparently not buying Tang Xiu’s words. “If you were in Ning City last night, it’s impossible for you to return to Shanghai so early today, huh? Even if you’re boasting, please don’t leave such a loophole.”</p><p>Tang Xiu couldn’t help but laugh and didn’t bother arguing back with her over such a trivial matter. As they walked deeper, he soon met Yang Pengchao and Yue Li.</p><p>****</p><p>Coldness gleamed in Wang Wei’s eyes as they watched Tang Xiu’s back as he left. After he left, he let out a low growl, “What a very arrogant guy. So rampant while just relying on his very formidable strength? I admit my loss today, but I’ll pay you back one day!”</p><p>There was a complicated expression on Yang Yang’s face as he shook his head. He took a deep breath and bitterly said, “Just forget it, Wang Wei! We won’t be able to enact revenge, much less deal with him.”</p><p>Wang Wei was irritated upon hearing Yang Yang and unhappily retorted, “What did you say? Your hand was broken by him, yet you unexpectedly have gotten so down? Don’t you know the most stupid thing is to raise your enemy to a pedestal and destroy your own spirit?”</p><p>“You wouldn’t have said that had you known who the Amur Tiger of the Northern Region was.” Yang Yang shook his head. “Just forget it. I admit I deserve this punishment today, and I have decided to give up on Ouyang Lulu since she’s his woman now.”</p><p>“What the fuck did you say?” chided Wang Wei furiously. “I really misread you. I thought you were a man, but now I see you are so cowardly! Even if he’s very formidable, what about it? Is he even much more powerful than bullets? Worst comes to worst, I can just spend some money to hire a powerful hitman and directly erase him silently.”</p><p>Yang Yang’s pupils shrunk and he looked around quickly. After he found that there was nobody around, only then did he feel relieved. He lowly shouted, “Can you cut your crap? You may want to court your death, but not with that method! I’ll tell you something. If he’s really the one who killed the Amur Tiger, let alone any powerful hitman, even the top in the world Spectre would never be able to kill him!”</p><p>Wang Wei slapped his face hard as his answer, then pointed his nose and chided, “You’re full of shit! Now you are scared of him? You’re telling me the world’s best assassin Spectre wouldn’t be able to kill him? Even if there are 10,000 people like him, Spectre can eliminate them. You know shit. I coincidentally saw Spectre kill while I was watching through a telescope two kilometers away.. But I guarantee it’s a cinch for him to kill this punk.”</p><p>“Nope. You’re wrong. I would never be able to kill him.”</p><p>Spectre, clad in a black Wushu suit with arms folded, suddenly appeared by a tree a little over five meters away from them. It was him who spoke while groaning and leaning on that tree.</p><p>Yang Yang’s face drastically changed. He had just observed the vicinity, so he was sure that nobody was around within a large radius. How was this man able to come over? Is he a ghost or something?</p><p>“You are…”</p><p>After Wang Wei clearly saw Spectre’s face, his legs went so soft that he almost knelt down on the ground. He grabbed Yang Yan’s arm, and once his body stopped shaking, he paced back a few steps further and stutteringly said, “Y-you… you are… you’re that seclusive… Spectre? The best assassin in the world, Spectre?”</p><p>“Didn’t you say it yourself—that you accidentally saw me kill someone before?” Spectre chuckled and said, “So what’s the fuss for? Is it even needed?”</p><p>Wang Wei released Yang Yang while deep dread and fright remained on his face.</p><p>Plop!</p><p>He knelt down while looking up to Spectre and called out, “… Please… please don’t kill us. I’ll pay 10 times the price if someone has paid you to kill us… no, no, no. I’ll pay 20 times the price. But please spare us.”</p><p>Yang Yang was utterly dumbfounded. He never expected that after they just spoke about the Devil, the Devil himself came right away! To think that the top hitman in the world unexpectedly appeared before them. Yet, why did he come to China and even to Shanghai? How come he has appeared here in Paradise Manor?</p><p>This… isn’t this way too coincidental? Or, is Wang Wei mistaken?</p><p>Spectre lackadaisically looked up toward the glaring sun. Then, he shook his head and sighed, “Dammit, I’m so bored, so very bored. It thought I could kill two punk chickens to throw my boredom away. But I didn’t expect you to be so afraid of annoying my Boss further right in front of his face, while only daring to make a fuss when his back is turned. Bah! He’s too softhearted, really. That Boss of mine is too kind and merciful.”</p><p>His Boss? Spectre’s Boss?!!</p><p>Yang Yang and Wang Wei suddenly remembered Tang Xiu. The duo instantly was filled with disbelief at the same time. To make sure their guess was correct, Yang Yang hurriedly asked, “You mean… Tang Xiu is your Boss? How is this possible? What qualifications does he have to be your Boss? You’re the best hitman in the world!”</p><p>Spectre rolled his eyes at him and snarled, “Man, Boss was right. You truly are stupid and ignorant. Umm, I recall there’s an adage in your country. What is it? The frog at the bottom of a well? That’s right, that’s it. You both really are like frogs stranded in the bottom of a well. You can never know what kind of power my Boss possesses. Haih, forget it. You won’t even understand it even if I tell you. But then again, he seems to have become much stronger after he came back, though. My legs kinda shivered even though he didn’t unleash his aura deliberately.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
