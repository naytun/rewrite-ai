They literally unleashed everything. Most of the buildings inside the plantation were ruined, while dozens of acres of the plantation had been destroyed. The Dark Shaman Clan itself was far inferior to the Celestial Wizard Clan and their experts were much weaker than the Celestial Wizard Clan’s experts.</p><p>Therefore, Singli, who was the nominal second strongest expert of the Dark Shaman Clan, was hardly able to fend off the onslaught of the encirclement. Bloody wounds now decorated his body and made him alarmed.</p><p>The 13 Shaman Guardians were very strong, especially when all of them joined forces. The Tenebrous Domain they just formed was a great obstruction to Mo Awu and his team. Even if the latter had formed a sword array, they could only barely gain the upper hand, and they weren’t able to cause fatal damage to the 13 Shaman Guardians and Singkuo.</p><p>“Break the siege quickly!”</p><p>Singli furiously roared during his struggle to fend off the besiegement. He gritted his teeth as a decisive look appeared on his face. He pulled out two black metal balls and retreated backward in the blink of an eye. After distancing himself from Singluen and his five guardian elders, he shouted, “You’ve just forced me, Singluen. We came to save you, yet you actually want to exterminate us. If so, then let’s perish together. After all, Singkuo is much better than you as the Head of the Dark Shaman Clan.”</p><p>The moment Singluen saw the objects Singli took out, his pupils instantly shrunk and he looked horrified. He shouted, “Taking out the Dark God Thunder, are you fucking crazy, Singli? How dare you use the Dark God Thunder? You want to use it so all of us die with our souls scattered into nothingness, unable to reincarnate?!!”</p><p>In response, Singli’s eyes just sparkled with a chilling light. He said fiercely, “It’s all forced by you. I don’t have the ability to fight you all, so the only option is to drag you all to hell with me. But if you draw back now, I won’t resort to this desperate measure either.”</p><p>“This…”</p><p>Singluen knitted his brows. After stopping the five guardian elders, he then turned to look at Tang Xiu.</p><p>“What’s Dark God Thunder exactly?” asked Tang Xiu indifferently.</p><p>“It’s a fearsome mine-like object our Dark Shaman Clan’s ancestors have spent a lot of effort to refine. Once detonated, the explosion will raze an area of several hundreds of meters. If two Dark God Thunder were to be detonated simultaneously, the explosive power would increase by several times, and everything within a radius of a kilometer will vanish in the blink of an eye. Further, it also has two other horrible effects. One of which is it contains potent poison. Even if one can resist the explosion, they will still die by the poison. But the second effect aims at the soul of human beings, a Witchcraft Flame that will burn the souls and simply erase them—leading to a true death. It’s rather similar to the Darkness Forbidden Art of our Dark Shaman Clan.</p><p>‘That’s quite vicious and malevolent.’</p><p>The explanation made Tang Xiu comment in his mind with a bit of apprehension. He then looked at the two Dark God Thunder in Singli’s hand before he fell into silence for a short while. Then, he asked in a low voice, “Does your clan have many of this thing?”</p><p>“No. The manufacturing process of the Dark God Thunder is very difficult. We only have about 20 of them even after manufacturing it for generations after generations.” Singluen shook his head and forced a smile. “Also, as far as I know, eight of them have been used, meaning that my clan only has 12 of them left. The Dark God Thunder is usually under the control of my father and is sealed in our clan’s vault. I never thought that Singli would turn out to have taken two of them.”</p><p>“Does your father allow any members of your clan to have it?” asked Tang Xiu. “This object is definitely a fatal threat to him as well, don’t you think so?”</p><p>The question made Singluen’s eyes sparkle. He then replied in a heavy voice, “Your question is on the mark, Mr. Tang. All the Patriarchs of the Dark Shaman Clan have a strict decree that none of us are allowed to have the Dark God Thunder as a private possession. Otherwise, the person will be regarded as rebelling against the clan. The punishment for the crime is death. Hence, nobody among us would dare to hold the Dark God Thunder secretly, unless that person has a malicious intention. It’s evident now that Singli has been harboring evil intention by having this object in his hands.”</p><p>In that instant, Singli’s face paled like a sheet. He had indeed been hiding the truth from the Clan Patriarch, Singtuo, for taking two Dark God Thunders. He had been planning to use it on Singtuo once he had a good chance someday.</p><p>As long as Singtuo was killed by then, he would become the most powerful man with the highest position in the Dark Shaman Clan. It was very likely that he would become the Patriarch of the clan. He had secretly vowed to himself that he wouldn’t take the Dark God Thunder out unless he faced a critical moment of life and death. But now, he was facing such a crisis, which forced him to take this object out and prepare to use it to save his life.</p><p>‘Alas… I don’t think I can go back again to the Dark Shaman Clan. The Patriarch won’t let me go even if I survive here. Shit, forget about it now. It’s an issue for later! I must pass this crisis safely now. I’m not too old and still have decades to live. It’s still possible for me to reach a higher cultivation level and extend my lifespan for many decades.’</p><p>He understood deeply that being alive was much better than death. Although he unleashed a seething killing aura and put on a ferocious appearance, he was still worrying that Tang Xiu would still insist on killing him due to not knowing the power of the Dark God Thunder.</p><p>Tang Xiu himself was currently staring at Singli while analyzing countless solutions in mind. Then, he asked with an apathetic face, “You are Singli, who’s said to be the second expert of the Dark Shaman Clan, yes?”</p><p>“That’s correct,” replied Singli in a deep voice.</p><p>Tang Xiu took out a cigarette and lit it up. He took two deep puffs and then said slowly, “When you took out the Dark God Thunder, it is a fact that you’ve violated the decree of your Dark Shaman Clan, as well as rebelling against the code made by your ancestors. You’ve been harboring malicious intent and have been covering up your sinister scheme. Once the news gets to your clan’s Patriarch, you’ll definitely pay a painful price even if he doesn’t kill you.”</p><p>“What exactly do you wanna say?” asked Singli in a heavy voice.</p><p>“It’s simple. You’ve lost your place in your clan and will soon be exterminated by your own clansmen, so you’re nothing but a stray dog now,” said Tang Xiu. “Do you think it’s still worth it to tear off all the decorum with us now?”</p><p>“You mean… you want me to give up protecting Singkuo?” Singli’s eyes filled with coldness. “Are you planning to let me go as long as I give up on him?”</p><p>“That’s right,” answered Tang Xiu without hesitation. “We won’t bother you as long as you don’t hinder our operation. I’m sure you know the whole story that has unfolded here. You’re also perfectly aware of everything that happened between Singluen and Singkuo. Now, it comes down to a simple matter. Singluen’s purpose is to kill Singkuo and to become the Dark Shaman Clan’s Patriarch. You can leave at any time if you’re not in our way.”</p><p>Singli’s complexion changed several times. After being silent for several seconds, he finally nodded and said, “I give you my word. I won’t bother Singluo with anything regarding his life. But there’s one condition I demand from you.”</p><p>“You think you’re qualified to make a demand? You’re not,” said Tang Xiu. “I can tell you one thing. You’d definitely die if I wanted to kill you, even if you use those two Dark God Thunder bombs. I’d only need some other means to do that aside from killing you directly here and now.”</p><p>“FUCK IT. My condition is very simple,” said Singli angrily. “Singluen must not send any clansmen to hunt me down after he becomes the clan’s Patriarch. I can vow that I’ll come to help him three times if he needs help in the future!”</p><p>Tang Xiu just stared at him for a moment, then couldn’t help but laugh.</p><p>But Singluen looked joyful and he said in a deep voice, “I can promise you that.” He then turned his head to look at the black mist nearby and asked, “What should I do with these 13 Shaman Guardians, Mr. Tang?”</p><p>“Those who follow will prosper, while those who resist shall die; and those who suit their actions to the times are wise,” said Tang Xiu with a grim expression. “There’s no need to kill them if they give up resistance and no longer fight for Singkuo. They are, after all, the elites from your clan. If you’re going to be the Patriarch of the Dark Shaman Clan, then you’ll need their assistance as well.”</p><p>“That’s right. The 13 Shaman Guardians are the elite of the Dark Shaman Clan. Losing them will be a great loss for the whole clan, but each generation of Shaman Guardians only pledges loyalty to the Patriarch,” said Singluen. “All of you, you have my word that once I become our clan’s Patriarch, I’ll definitely entrust you with better position and responsibility. I’ll also foster your cultivation to a much higher level than my father’s. I’ve already told you all that the Dark Shaman Clan has been idle for far too long. Our clan needs drastic and decisive reform. We must give our everything to make progress. Only when the influence and power of the clan as a whole has increased will we be able to have higher status and power among the others. And I firmly believe that someday in the future, our clan will be much stronger than Poland’s Celestial Wizard Clan!”</p><p>The killing aura of several Shaman Guardians inside the Tenebrous Domain was weakened by half. They exchanged glances and used special techniques to discuss Singluen’s words.</p><p>They were Shaman Guardians, the most loyal supporters of the clan’s Patriarch, while also a group boasting powerful strength in the clan. They always stayed away from the internal struggle of the clan, and wouldn’t have come here if it wasn’t for the order from the Patriarch. Even if Singkuo and SIngluen were to perish together, they wouldn’t even spare a glance.</p><p>But now Singli, who was supposed to lead them, had been a traitor, causing a dilemma.</p><p>Singkuo, whose body was battered and wounded, could keenly sense the ideas the 13 Shaman Guardians had in mind. He felt like he had fallen into a glacier hole. Fear crept up and inundated his whole being, nearly making him freeze.</p><p>“You’re all Shaman Guardians, the most trusted men of my father, as well as the most elite warriors of the Dark Shaman Clan! Father wants you all to save me; are you all going to defy his order? You also know that SIngluen has yet to become our clan’s Patriarch!!!”</p><p>A firm and decisive look appeared on the 13 Shaman Guardians’ faces. What Singkuo just said was correct. Singluen indeed hadn’t yet become the clan’s Patriarch. However, the command given by their Patriarch was to rescue… no, this was all wrong!</p><p>Suddenly, the captain of the Shaman Guardians wore a strange expression. He then quickly used a special technique to communicate with his comrades. The decision had been made in just half a minute.</p><p>“We will withdraw!” shouted the Shaman Guardians’ captain.</p><p>The declaration made Singkuo’s face drastically change. He instantly guarded against the Shaman Guardians. With a vigilant look, he exclaimed loudly. “Are you really going to betray the Patriarch and the whole clan?! He ordered you…”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
