She hadn’t thought about any of it back when she was sailing at sea, for safety was all that was in her mind then. At this moment, however, she finally realized that Tang Xiu’s purpose in coming to Bangkok was highly likely suspicious and problematic.</p><p>Did he get into trouble in the mainland too?</p><p>The thought popped up in her mind, but she denied it right away and shook her head. Tang Xiu was well-known as the Young Divine Doctor in China, the owner of the Magnificent Tang Corporation, as well as someone who had a deep relationship with the Huang from the Fukang Province. Who was possibly able to force him out and make him flee China?</p><p>Therefore, there was only one possibility left that made him illegally enter Bangkok, which was absolutely related to this very big secret. And yet, what secret could it be?</p><p>Countless thoughts swirled inside Zuo Qing’s mind, but still, she couldn’t find any answer at all. It wasn’t until her father patted her on the shoulder did she finally give up on thinking about it.</p><p>“Alright, don’t think about it first. Just have a shower and rest well,” whispered Zuo Daquan after he retracted back his eyes from the direction where Tang Xiu and his men left from.</p><p>Zuo Qing nodded without a word, no longer blaming her father for refusing Tang Xiu to stay in his place. She was weary and sleepy right now. She had practically exhausted her spirit just on the journey to leave for Bangkok in such a rush. She really needed to take a hot bath, have a meal, and then take a good rest.</p><p>Ring, ring, ring…</p><p>Just as Zuo Daquan took his daughter and two grandsons into the European-style building, his mobile phone rang. He took out his cell phone and picked up the call as the voice of the security captain then reported, “Boss, Mr. Tang wants to borrow two cars of ours. He said that it would help him with his work in Bangkok.”</p><p>Pondering for a moment, Zuo Daquan then said, “Give him two cars, but replace the license plates before you give them away. And do tell him about it.”</p><p>“Roger that, Boss,” respectfully replied the security captain.</p><p>Outside the manor, the burly security captain put away his mobile phone and then spoke to Tang Xiu. “My men will take the two cars and they will be here immediately, Mr. Tang. But the car’s license plates will be changed, so you need to pay attention to that.”</p><p>“I understand.” Tang Xiu nodded.</p><p>Shortly after, two black SUV stopped in front of Tang Xiu. Two men jumped out of the driver’s seat and quickly handed the keys to the security captain. The latter then gave the keys to Tang Xiu and nodded, “I wish you all the best, and Godspeed, Mr. Tang.”</p><p>“Send my thanks to Mr. Zuo,” said Tang Xiu.</p><p>On the straight road in the suburbs, two black off-road cars quickly headed toward the downtown area. Singluen and Tang Xiu were sitting in the back seat of the second car, and the former spoke with a scowl on his face, “It was really unexpected. You’ve helped them so much, Mr. Tang, yet they didn’t even want us to stay in their manor? What a loathsome attitude. I’ll definitely teach him to taste regret once I’ve become the Dark Shaman clan’s Patriarch.”</p><p>“I understand where he’s coming from and why he doesn’t want us to stay, though,” said Tang Xiu smilingly. “As a cautious and meticulous man like Zuo Daquan, the worries that he has that I would join his enemies to strike him is understandable. The other point is that he holds suspicion about our purpose in coming to Bangkok. If I were in his shoes, there’s no way I’d let strangers stay in my place either. Anyway, let’s just forget it. Him being tolerant and giving us two cars is already a good thing, though.”</p><p>“Haih, I really don’t get you, Mr. Tang. It’s like your character is rather contradictory,” sighed Singluen. “You’re so heartless and ruthless against your enemies, yet you’re so tolerant when facing this kind of situation. I have even seen you turn into a good person sometimes.”</p><p>“You mean I kinda have a variable temperament or something like that?” asked Tang Xiu with a smile.</p><p>“Yeah.” Singluen nodded.</p><p>“Well, the Chinese have an old adage that all men are naturally born with goodness and kindness at heart,” said Tang Xiu with a light smile. “Everyone’s conscience leans towards goodness, which is carved deep in the bottom of their hearts. The more one grows older, the better the ability and the more people with various characters and natures she or he has to face in life. Stretch your hand out to help those who are weak yet kind people, but be ruthless when facing powerful enemies before you. No matter how good your heart is, cruel people you will encounter are too many to count. There’s also another saying in China that exterminating evil people can save countless good people from their torment.”</p><p>“If so, then are you a good man?” asked Singluen.</p><p>“No, I’m not, and yet I’m not an evil man either.” Tang Xiu shook his head and said, “Every man has their own set of codes—moral codes that serve as a scale to weigh their own actions. But there’s one thing you must remember, Singluen; the reward is reaped after you sow kindness. Retribution will come for all the wicked deeds you’ve done. Don’t ever bully the weak even though you’ve become the Patriarch of your Dark Shaman clan later. You’ll find that cultivating goodness in your mind and actions, as well as learning to help others, is a very interesting and enjoyable life in and of itself. Further, there’s also an old saying in China that a man who is down usually becomes a target, for there will be others who’ll take the opportunity to suppress those who suffer setbacks. When you have power and fall to wickedness, those who hate you because of your repression will rally up and jump out to haunt and destroy you once you lose your power someday. But any kindness you give to people will perhaps make those who remember your grace extend their helping hand when you’re down.”</p><p>Singluen’s eyes lit up with a pensive look within them. He fell into silence for a long while and then silently nodded. “I think I get what you mean, Mr. Tang.”</p><p>Tang Xiu patted his shoulder. Then, he looked at Tang Guang in the front seat, saying. “Quickly find somewhere for us to stay for some time. Do pay attention to conceal our tracks as well. If my guess is correct, Singkuo must have invited some other forces to find Singluen’s tracks and deal with him. It’s very likely that he’ll find the Darkwind organization and the Godfather of Bangkok, Kanaja, for this purpose.”</p><p>“Jin Shi might be able to get us a safe house to stay at, Boss,” replied Tang Guang.</p><p>“Why do you say that?” asked Tang Xiu in surprise.</p><p>“As far as I know, he has been tasked with some missions in Thailand previously and he stayed here for quite some time, so he’s familiar with the situation here,” answered Tang Guang. “Also, given his nature, he definitely has a safe place for himself here.”</p><p>Tang Xiu then took his cell phone out and dialed Jin Shi’s number. After the latter picked up his call, he asked, “Where are you now, Jin Shi?”</p><p>“We just arrived in Bangkok, Boss.” Jin Shi’s voice came out of the phone. “We’re now heading to a safehouse where I used to stay in Bangkok. Would you like to join us, or do you have another intention in mind?”</p><p>“Just tell me the address. We’ll catch up with you,” said Tang Xiu.</p><p>“Feather Palace Club in Don Mueang District,” replied Jin Shi.</p><p>“That’s it for now. I’ll contact you again when we get there,” said Tang Xiu. “Keep in mind to conceal your tracks and whereabouts, lest you expose yourself and all of us.”</p><p>Downtown Bangkok.</p><p>In the wide Springforth Manor was a cluster of connected buildings. The interior was filled with lush vegetation and beautiful surroundings with small bridges, rock gardens, and a small artificial lake, similar to the Lakeheart Pavilion that was built with an oriental architecture atmosphere.</p><p>Wearing white casual attire, Kanaja was standing by the lake while holding a fishing rod and sitting quietly on the shore fishing. Accompanying him were two pretty girls who served him tea, whereas Songzan silently sat next to him reading a stack of documents.</p><p>“I’ve read it, Godfather,” said Songzan respectfully.</p><p>“Since you’re done reading it, then go to the club!” Kanaja turned to look at him and calmly said, “You must stay low there and take care of the business for three years. You can then take over the Don Mueang District as your site after this three-year period is over.”</p><p>Songzan silently nodded and then said, “My loyalty is forever yours, Godfather. You’ve kept my life, and I’ll do everything you want me to do.”</p><p>“Just take care of some of the younger ones with a bright mind later, and avoid giving any important position to those who have obvious defects, lest they court trouble later, alright?” said Kanaja as he sighed, “Haih… that Mr. Tang has too big a background. I’ve sent some men to China in secret just to investigate anything about him, yet there has been no news and none of them have returned. If my guess is correct, I’m afraid they are all already dead, hence why I killed those who know about that matter besides you. For the sake of keeping it a secret, don’t let me down again, Songzan.”</p><p>The face of a young man appeared in Songzan’s mind and he immediately shivered inwardly. Then he said respectfully, “I won’t let you down, Godfather.”</p><p>At this time, a burly man leading more than a dozen people approached from afar. They were the Dark Shaman clansmen, while the burly young man who led them was Singkuo.</p><p>“Kanaja!”</p><p>With an indifferent expression, Singkuo called out as he came to Kanaja’s side.</p><p>Kanaja turned his head and immediately put down the fishing rod in his hands upon seeing Singkuo. Then, he let out a smile and said, “Ah, it’s you, Young Master Singkuo. You’re a rare guest. What wind blows you here to see me today? It’s been a long time since I met your old man. Did he ask you to come here to call me over for a drink or something?”</p><p>“He has been in seclusion as of recently, Kanaja,” said Singkuo with a smile. “That’s why he rarely contacts outsiders. I need your help, which is why I came to you this time.”</p><p>“What kind of help though?” asked Kanaja smilingly. “I won’t ignore your plea as long as I can do it. We’re friends, after all.”</p><p>Singkuo took out a few photos and handed them over to Kanaja, stating, “I want you to help me by mobilizing your men to find these people. They are probably not in Bangkok now, but I hope that your men can find them once they enter Bangkok and then pass the news to me.”</p><p>Kanaja took the photos. An dull light flashed in his eyes after he glanced at them. He was silent for a short moment and then slowly nodded. “This is just a minor matter. I’ll inform you once I get the news.”</p><p>“I will trouble you then, Mr. Kan,” nodded Singkuo. “Also, I’d like to invite you to have a few drinks after some issues have been dealt with.”</p><p>Kanaja then continued to engage in small talk for a while. After he watched Singkuo and his men leave, he threw the photos to the ground and stamped on them as he sneered, “Hmph… I, Kanaja, have been muddling along in this shit for many years. I know those who I can provoke and those who I can’t afford to mess with. Your Dark Shaman clan is indeed very strong, but don’t fucking expect me to help you for nothing and no reason at all. Heh, this whole fucking shit is your clan’s shitty infighting, and you all even have that harbinger of death involved.”</p><p>Songzan picked up the photos and took a look at them. His complexion then changed after seeing them, and he said in a whisper, “Isn’t this that Mr. Tang, Godfather?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
