He was as though seeing the scene of a grand festive in the Immortal World, where myriads of living beings fought against the Heaven, facing the world, all while battling against other living beings.</p><p>After half an hour, Tang Xiu left the Green Lake Agricola by car but ordered Mo Awu to closely monitor the situation in the venue. He then brought Li Qiang to return to the Chang City Hotel.</p><p>“So, has everything been arranged well?” suddenly asked Tang Xiu after taking off his coat and looking at Xue Yue. She had taken a shower, and was now wearing pajamas while sitting on the couch reading a book.</p><p>Xue Yu put the book down and nodded, “Everything’s done. Also, I got a call from someone surnamed Huang. He invited me to a coffee café on the first floor of the hotel.”</p><p>Tang Xiu couldn’t help but laugh and said, “This guy is truly impatient, isn’t he? So, what then? Did you promise him?”</p><p>“If I didn’t promise, then how will I play my role in your script?” Xue Yu chuckled and said, “Anyway, do you really plan to use Li Qiang?”</p><p>“This guy is talented; taking him to use later might result in a good outcome in the future,” said Tang Xiu. “But I think he has some concerns in mind. I can tell that he wanted to speak to me about it many times tonight, but he ended up saying nothing.”</p><p>“Well, he has an ill family member,” said Xue Yu with a smile.</p><p>“Did you just use your divination art again?” asked Tang Xiu curiously.</p><p>“Nope. It’s the finding I got from the previous divination.” Xue Yu shook her head. “He seems to be short on money and should’ve been raising money to treat his family member. Also, I found something else interesting. Back when he betrayed every company that employed him, he always pushed each of its Boss to a miserable fate. He may be hated by those Bosses, but there were also some other variables in them too.”</p><p>Tang Xiu ruminated for a moment before he suddenly said, “Alright. Let Hei Xiong and Xue Sha take care of Boss Huang, while you and I have a trip to Li Qiang’s house then.”</p><p>“Alright!” gently nodded Xue Yu.</p><p>****</p><p>At about ten at night, Li Qiang, who was a bit tipsy, returned to his home in the Qingya District. He then opened his bedroom door and saw his wife, Luo Yu, leaning on the bedside lamp while standing in a daze, lost in thought. He let out a faint smile and reached out to untie his tie, saying, “It’s so late now, why haven’t you rested yet?”</p><p>Luo Yu came back to her senses and softly said, “I couldn’t sleep since you hadn’t come back yet.”</p><p>Li Qiang wanted to sit down on the bedside as he suddenly realized that he was reeking of liquor. Then he said immediately, “Well, I just had a drink with a client tonight and kinda reek of alcohol. I’ll take a shower first and come back soon.”</p><p>“Okay!” nodded Luo Yu slightly, watching her husband enter the bathroom in the back. There was, however, a distressed and dear love on her face as she did so. She knew that she had been dragging her husband down all these years. Sometimes, thoughts of suicide came to her, but oftentimes when she was about to do so, she could only hesitate. It was not because she was afraid of death, but rather because she didn’t want to leave her beloved husband alone in this world.</p><p>“Oh…” Luo Yu sighed gloomily and looked up at the ceiling, trying to prevent her tears that were about to burst.</p><p>Shortly after, Li Qiang was done with his shower. After he put on his pajamas and was about to get into bed, he gently hugged Luo Yu and said, “I’ll probably be very busy in the next two days. But as long as I succeed, I won’t only make enough money for your surgery, but we’ll also have some left for the post-surgery care. If you feel bored, I’ll call my younger sister to come back to accompany you.”</p><p>“No. Don’t disturb Xinjie,” said Luo Yu hurriedly. “She just finished her freshman year, and she wants to find a part-time job during her summer vacation in Shanghai. Just let her temper and train herself without disturbance. Besides, the living expenses she has been receiving from you have been kinda not enough, all due to you needing to pay my medical expenses. I really don’t want to drag her down again and again.”</p><p>“You see, Xinjie’s reason for staying and working in Shanghai is mainly to earn more money and save the tuition fee for the sophomore year I gave her,” said Li Qiang with a smile. “But I just told you that I can make quite a fortune in the next few days, didn’t I? We’ll solve the problem at hand in the next two weeks, so there’s no need for her to work and earn money outside. She just needs to come back to keep you company and taking care of you.”</p><p>“Is it the sales order you mentioned to me that you’re currently negotiating?” asked Luo Yu curiously.</p><p>“Yeah.” Li Qiang nodded and said, “I haven’t only negotiated it, but I’ll also shock many people after I disclose what has happened to me these past two days. Well, let’s drop it now, shall we? I won’t tell you the details for now. Shortly put, you just have to trust me that we can have a good life soon.”</p><p>“I believe you,” said Luo Yu with a smile.</p><p>Following that, the couple chatted for a while. Just as they were preparing to rest, the doorbell suddenly rang. Li Qiang, who was drowsy, frowned and said, “Who could it be at this hour?”</p><p>“Just go and have look!” said Luo Yu softly.</p><p>A short while after, Li Qiang opened the door and saw that it was Tang Xiu and Xue Yu outside. Disbelief covered his face and he asked in astonishment, “Brother Tang, Big Sis-in-law, why are you here?”</p><p>Tang Xiu forged ahead into the door and said with a faint smile, “Are we disturbing you and your family’s rest by coming this late?”</p><p>Li Qiang quickly shook his head and said, “No. I’m just a bit curious how you knew where I live, though.”</p><p>“Would it be difficult for me if I wanted to investigate someone’s address?” asked Tang Xiu with a smile.</p><p>Li Qiang recalled Tang Xiu’s identity and he immediately let out a dry smile and said, “It’s a cinch for you indeed.”</p><p>“Alright, let’s spare the small talk, shall we?” said Tang Xiu as he continued, “If my guess is correct, you should have an ill family member here, right? You’ve been with me tonight and you also heard that a lot of people address me as Divine Doctor Tang, so I came to your place to dissolve the rest of your worries.”</p><p>Li Qiang was shaken inwardly and he hastily said, “B-Brother Tang… I… I indeed have an ill family member. It’s my wife. She has heart disease, as well as some mild symptoms of kidney failure. However, I just signed the sales contract. With the commission from it, I will have enough money for my wife’s surgery.”</p><p>“What’s wrong? You don’t believe me, do you?” asked Tang Xiu smilingly.</p><p>With his thoughts pointed out and laid bare, Li Qiang let out a dry smile and said, “… Why would I? You’re a famous Young Divine Doctor. It’s just, can Chinese medicine cure heart disease?”</p><p>“Can it? Well, you gotta try to know,” said Tang Xiu with a smile. “Alright, get ready. If your wife is still awake, I can treat her soon.”</p><p>“But, Brother Tang…” Li Qiang hesitated, “The hospital has given her a specialized treatment program, I…”</p><p>“I can leave immediately if you don’t believe me,” interrupted Tang Xiu immediately. “Of course, if you want me to try it, I’ll never harm your wife even if I’m unable to cure her illness.”</p><p>Upon hearing those words, Li Qiang immediately felt at ease and hurriedly said, “Brother Tang, Big Sis-in-law, please have a seat first. I’ll call my wife out.”</p><p>Immediately after, Li Qiang quickly entered the bedroom half-running.</p><p>“I’ve heard everything. Who exactly is that Young Divine Doctor?” asked Luo Yu softly.</p><p>“He’s the Young Divine Doctor Tang Xiu from the Star City Chinese Medical Hospital. He’s also famous as a very amazing practitioner of Chinese medicine in the country,” said Li Qiang in a whisper. “Wife, he said that he won’t harm you even if he can’t cure your heart disease. Would you like to give it a try?”</p><p>Luo Yu nodded and said, “I’ve heard of him too. He’s a very amazing young miracle-working doctor. I’m going to try it since you say it’s OK.”</p><p>Outside, in the living room.</p><p>Tang Xiu could clearly hear the couple’s conversation and, after they came out, he observed the complexion of Luo Yu as he nodded and said, “A Yin-Yang deficiency and renal function decline. Can I check your pulse?”</p><p>“Alright!” Luo Yu extended her wrist after taking a seat in front of Tang Xiu.</p><p>Quickly after, Tang Xiu let out a smile and took out a box of silver needles from his interspatial ring and said, “You only have a very common heart disease, a very easy case for me. That’s right—Li Qiang, boil some water. We’re going to use it a bit later.”</p><p>“Got it!” replied Li Qiang immediately as he dashed to the kitchen.</p><p>A smile began outlining on the corners of Tang Xiu’s mouth. He grinned and said softly, “Take off your pajamas quickly. I need to take out the heart pacemaker in your chest. Also, you may feel some pain, but please endure it.”</p><p>“Pardon? You… Do you want to take out the pacemaker device in my heart? This…” Luo Yu was scared stiff and dumbfounded, looking at Tang Xiu with a dumbstruck expression.</p><p>Tang Xiu glanced at the kitchen door and immediately stunned Luo Yu, making her faint. With Xue Yu’s help, he undressed Luo Yu out of her pajamas and moved lightning fast. He constantly pierced the main acupoints in the area around Luo Yu’s heart with silver needles, before taking out a sharp scalpel…</p><p>“HEY! WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING?!!”</p><p>A few minutes later, when Li Qiang came out of the kitchen with a half-pot of hot water, the scene he saw made him scream and fly into a rage as he roared and dashed forward.</p><p>“If you don’t wanna have your wife have complications, just shut up!” shouted Tang Xiu back.</p><p>Li Qiang put the hot water pot on the floor and watched Tang Xiu’s hand that kept dancing and moving smoothly with the scalpel. His eyes were seething in rage, but he forcefully suppressed it and angrily growled, “Divine Doctor Tang, I don’t give a fucking shit whether you’re a true miracle-working doctor or not. But if something goes wrong with my wife, I’ll drag you to hell with me!”</p><p>“Noisy,” hummed Tang Xiu apathetically as he kept moving the scalpel’s tip to take out the pacemaker device from Luo Yu’s chest, quickly injecting his Primal Chaos Force into her body to stop the bleeding and support the repairment of her heart.</p><p>Time fleeted by, and, after more than 20 minutes, Tang Xiu finally ceased injecting his Primal Chaos Force. He then took out the needle thread and carefully began to suture the wound. Both his hands were very steady and calm. Even though the stitching wasn’t dense, the effect was remarkable. After he was done with the suturing process, he washed his hands in the basin of warm water and looked at Li Qiang, stating, “There are 12 silver needles around the heart of your wife’s. Keep in mind that you must not pull them out in the next 24 hours. I’ll come back here 24 hours from now; at that time, you’ll know if my treatment worked or not.”</p><p>Li Qiang truly wanted to put up a desperate fight with Tang Xiu so much. Tang Xiu actually dared to do such a surgery to his wife without his or his wife consent, even using such a crude and superficial method. However, at this point, he could only accept the state of his wife. He could only pray to the Gods, to Heaven for a blessing and protection of his wife—for her to be safe and sound in the end.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
