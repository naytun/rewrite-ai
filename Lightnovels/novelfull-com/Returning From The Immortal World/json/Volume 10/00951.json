He had always been a man with a soft heart, even in his past life. Once upon a time, he regarded himself as an idealist, believing that if he only loved one woman in his life, he would be able to be together with her until the earth and heaven got old. And yet, the final outcome shred that dream of his to pieces.</p><p>Certainly, there was also another variable in the works. After he came to Earth, he chose to cultivate in the Heavenly Art of Cosmic Genesis, the most profound cultivation art originating from the Demon Realm. It began affecting his nature without him realizing it. Previously a man of self-restraint, he was now gradually turning into a man who followed his own whim—a free and unfettered man who does as he wishes for his entire life—which was the condition set by the Heavenly Art of Cosmic Genesis to reach its highest cultivation realm.</p><p>A warm feeling filled Tang Xiu’s heart as he looked at the slightly worried expression that Zhang Xinya was showing him. It was the sincerity of the heart, and he also wished to give it back to her. He gently hugged her and smilingly said, “I’m always careful in whatever I do. When I fight or run into danger, I’ll win or stay away from it if I can’t win and deal with it another time. Besides, those who could possibly kill me haven’t yet been born into this world.”</p><p>Zhang Xinya nodded gently. She herself absolutely didn’t wish to become Tang Xiu’s burden, even though he had accepted her as his woman. That way, she wouldn’t affect his affairs.</p><p>To her, returning back the feeling was the best course to take.</p><p>She was a smart woman and knew that her current self was only able to support him from the back in silence. Becoming his woman was already enough of a joyful thing to her.</p><p>And tonight, she shed away all the constraints and unfolded all the curtains that cocooned her virginity, completely immersing herself in the world of love. Although it was her first time having her chastity broken, she still braved it to completely become Tang Xiu’s woman. Nevertheless, it was still her first time and she woke up full of shyness the next day with spasms of pain in her lower parts.</p><p>“Alright, let’s stroll around.”</p><p>She was now looking like an ordinary girl who was eager to spend time strolling around with her boyfriend, enjoying their time as a couple. Regardless of the faint ache she felt, she walked alongside Tang Xiu to leave the hotel.</p><p>Bangkok had many scenic spots and the couple visited many of them, tasting various delicacies and buying many things. The display of their sweet lovers attitude from the couple even provoked the envy of countless men and women. However, they still kept it under control to stay low-profile due to Zhang Xinya’s celebrity identity and dressed in simple disguises.</p><p>The vicinity near the Chao Phraya River.</p><p>On the edge of the avenue was a gathering crowd, most of whom who wore a travel agency’s red caps and watched street magic gigs. Bursts of praises could be heard from the crowd from time to time.</p><p>“Amazing!”</p><p>Despite knowing that the show involved some kinds of tricks, Zhang Xinya still praised as she saw the thin man with a scar on his left eyebrow unleash a flame from his palm and pull out a dove from the burning flame.</p><p>The trick shown by the middle-aged magician itself had been figured out by Tang Xiu after he released his perception, so he shook his head and said, “It’s all a trick, something you can also perform in front of ordinary audiences if you have some special stage props to perform with. If you wanna see what a true magic show is, I’ll perform it for you once we get back.”</p><p>“You can do magic gigs too?” asked Zhang Xinya, surprised.</p><p>“What I can do is much better than magic.” Tang Xiu chuckled and said, “Using stage props to perform such a feat is only for ordinary people. You definitely won’t be able to conceal it from experts’ eyes.”</p><p>“Hmph! What a boast.”</p><p>A girl standing next to them was unable to hold herself back from rolling her eyes and ridiculed. Her name was Li Yan, a Chinese tourist from a tour group. She was blown away from the magician’s wonderful performance, driving her to let out ridicule when she heard someone criticize it in Mandarin.</p><p>The young man beside her, Yu Xu, patted her shoulder and smilingly said, “Hehe, China has more than a billion people. You don’t need to be surprised if there’s any strange breed popping up among us. But this guy is indeed quite amazing, though, daring to talk so big when he’s abroad.”</p><p>Glancing at the couple who ridiculed him caused Tang Xiu to be unable to hold in his chuckle. Zhang Xinya, however, was unhappy after hearing some people mock Tang Xiu and grunted, “Who do you say is talking big, huh? My boyfriend always means what he says. He never speaks anything he cannot do!”</p><p>Li Yan faintly felt Zhang Xinya’s face was familiar. But she couldn’t recognize her with the sunhat and black big sunglasses that blocked most of her face, so she said, “People say that women in love always lose their mind, pretty girl. I think you’re way too infatuated with him. Lemme tell you, girl. Tell your boyfriend to grow up. It’s ridiculous hearing him brag like that, you know.”</p><p>“Pfft…”</p><p>Instead of getting irritated, Zhang Xinya was laughing as she suddenly thought that it was particularly interesting when she recalled Tang Xiu’s ability and nature. Tang Xiu himself was at a loss whether he had to cry or laugh and shook his head, “Hey, pretty girl. Haven’t you heard that you can destroy everything except one’s relationship? I don’t think we have any ill feelings, no?”</p><p>Li Yan smiled yet still rolled her eyes Tang Xiu, “I’m a beauty—that’s a fact. Not the likes of your fake bragging. But what you just boasted about doesn’t do justice for that magician. Just look for yourself—how many can perform better than him? Even everyone else around is applauding him! If you’re better than this awesome magician, you can expect my apology right away!”</p><p>Yu Xu, who was Li Yan’s admirer and pursuer, quickly chimed in after hearing it, “That’s right, man. I’ll immediately apologize to you on her behalf if you can prove you’re better than this magician.”</p><p>“I won’t bother with this little thing, so spare the apology.” Tang Xiu shook his head and smilingly said, “Besides, even if I want to show it off, I’m going to show it to my woman rather than have a full-blown performance on this avenue.”</p><p>“Hehe,” Yu Xu burst into laughter after hearing it, thinking that Tang Xiu was afraid. He immediately shouted aloud, “You guys shouldn’t be a member of a tourist group, right? Everyone, he just boasted that he’s a great magician himself and his magic is much better than this magician. I asked him to perform in public but he actually…. Hahaha… any of you want to see this guy’s performance too?”</p><p>In that instant, those in the surroundings turned their heads to look at Tang Xiu’s group. Even the performing magician looked indignant. He knew Mandarin and had been to China to perform his gigs. Although he was not that famous, he still felt irritated to have someone berate him.</p><p>Seeing that everyone’s eyes were trained on them, Zhang Xinya was worried that they would be exposed. She immediately grabbed Tang Xiu’s hand and said, “Let’s just leave! There’s nothing fun to see here. Let’s head somewhere else!”</p><p>Tang Xiu nodded and smiled. Just as they were about the walk away, that magician squeezed through the crowd and blocked their path.</p><p>A sullen Basong stared at Tang Xiu. He spoke out, “You can do magic performances yourself?”</p><p>“A bit, though it’s a shallow one,” said Tang Xiu.</p><p>A look of contempt betrayed Bassong’s face, “Shallow, huh? Then don’t brag just to influence others.”</p><p>“I affected your performance? It’s him who did that.” Tang Xiu pointed to Yu Xu and said, “I and my girlfriend just watched the show; it was this guy who yelled. If you wanna throw your tantrum, why don’t you pick on him?”</p><p>Yu Xu immediately glared and scowled, “What the hell? Don’t throw your shit on my head. It’s clear you just said that this magician’s magic is garbage, so we laughed at you. So what? You mocked others, but you won’t admit it now?”</p><p>“Is what he says true, young man?” Bassong growled, “You said my magic performance is trash?”</p><p>Seeing the hostility from these two fellas made Tang Xiu feel slightly helpless. Had he known that his comment would create such a ruckus, he wouldn’t have talked too much previously. He then looked at Zhang Xinya and asked, “Do you really want to see me performing magic?”</p><p>“I do. But…” Zhang Xinya hesitated and said, “But not here. It’s just that I don’t like this guy who sells out his fellow countryman and causes trouble.”</p><p>“What rubbish are you talking about?” Li Yan was unhappy and shouted, “What’s wrong with what my friend did? Selling out a fellow countryman and causing troubles? It was you who obviously mocked the magician and made us Chinese lose face. And now you speak like that? If you really got the ability, why don’t you show it off to everyone here?”</p><p>“You both are really noisy busybodies!” Tang Xiu creased his brows and said, “You really want to court some slaps in the face here? Fine! I hope you can take this lesson well so as not to provoke others and invite trouble later.”</p><p>With that said, he looked around and spoke aloud, “Everyone, since you want to see me performing magic, please retreat back so you won’t be affected when I’m performing my magic.”</p><p>Immediately, the crowd on the scene receded a few meters away, including the locals who didn’t even speak Chinese.</p><p>Tang Xiu then shifted his sight to Basong and sneered, “I did say your magic performance is just trash. Now lemme open your eyes as to what kind of magic can be called real and true!”</p><p>He slowly opened his hands elegantly, slightly blowing his breath towards his right hand. A small flame then appeared on his palm and was swayed by the wind. Tang Xiu blew again to his left hand and created another flame on his left palm.</p><p>“Everyone, I can also change the shape of this flame to any shape I wish to. Just tell me what shape you want to see this flame become. I’ll change it for you.”</p><p>A teenage girl amid the crowd shouted, “Can you change it to become a white dove? Just like what that magician did?”</p><p>“Change it to a white dove? That’s not even a challenge.” Tang Xiu laughed and said, “Alright, I’ll give you a flaming pigeon and make it dance around you.”</p><p>As he said that, Tang Xiu manipulated the flames to quickly transform into the shape of a dove. He gently waved to make the two flame pigeons get as big as the size of a normal pigeon in two seconds.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
