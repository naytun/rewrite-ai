Her Whole Unitary Sect had many magic weapons and tools, but the top-tier ones were few and far between. She received this sword as an inheritance from the sect’s elder, her Master. She had painstakingly nourished it with her True Origin power for hundreds of years, yet all of it went to waste now.</p><p>At this time, gushing killing intent finally birthed inside Daoist Zixuan’s heart despite the firm mind she had been cultivating. She truly hated all these Celestial Wizard people and was hardly able to contain herself from killing all of them. Yet, her sane self still reminded her that it would be a huge endeavor, even if she staked everything.</p><p>Even if she did try by staking everything and going all out, it was highly likely that she’d also die in the process, dragging her 10 disciples on the ship into this battle.</p><p>A few kilometers away, Tang Xiu could clearly see the battle scene in the distance through the high-powered binoculars. The outcome of the fight so far was not within his expectations, as only three experts of the Celestial Wizard clan were able to take the upper hand and force Daoist Zixuan to retreat, and her magical sword was also ruined.</p><p>“It’s really a pity.” Tang Xiu shook his head secretly.</p><p>Mo Awu put down the binoculars and said, “I think that Whole Unitary Sect’s female expert won’t be able to face these Celestial Wizard people. Also, there’s something strange with that black fog. It’s so corrosive and able to corrode and ruin her sword.”</p><p>“Yeah. If there was only one of the wizards, Daoist Zixuan would’ve been able to kill him easily.” Tang Xiu nodded and added, “But she’s facing against three while her opponents excel at team cooperation. Killing the three of them will prove very difficult for her. With her current situation, she’d pay a grave price to kill those three, even if she puts her life on the line.”</p><p>“I think the Celestial Wizard clan has also brought some other experts besides those three, Boss,” added Mo Awu in a deep voice. “There are more than forty more people on those two ships, so it’s very likely that some more powerful experts are hiding among them.”</p><p>“No, there are no more powerful experts on those two ships.” Tang Xiu shook his head after there was silence for a short while. “But there are some men on the newly arrived ship. They are at least not weaker than those three.”</p><p>Mo Awu was stunned, but recovered quickly to lift up the binoculars to look in the surroundings again. He quickly found that there was another ship near the two previous ships. There were only a few people on it, about a dozen, but the old man sitting on a chair on the deck looked to be strikingly atypical.</p><p>“The Celestial Wizard clan’s reinforcements just arrived?! Boss, it will be very difficult for those Whole Unitary Sect cultivators to return back alive if we don’t help them.”</p><p>“Yeah,” replied Tang Xiu. He then shot a glance at Jin Chanzi’s group of ten from the Whole Unitary Sect and added, “This sect has a long history and heritage that has been passed down for millenniums. The cultivation resources they have hoarded must be huge given that Jin Chanzi and his martial brothers were able to reach the Foundation Establishment Stage despite their young age; therefore, this sect must have invested a lot of resources on them. We have an agreement with this sect, and I need cultivation resources from them, so Daoist Zixuan mustn’t die.”</p><p>“Would you like me to contact everyone on the 9th island to come over?” asked Mu Awu.</p><p>“No need.” Tang Xiu shook his head and said, “Our men are at the Foundation Establishment Stage, so they won’t be able to fight in the air for a long time. Their True Essence power will be consumed quickly and they will fall into problems once they join the fight. We need to lure these Celestial Wizard people to the 9th island.”</p><p>“Let me do it, Boss,” said Mo Awu.</p><p>Tang Xiu thought about it and nodded. “I’ll give you this task later, but not now. We’re going to rescue the Whole Unitary Sect’s people once they are in dire peril. With a life-saving grace that they owe us, we’ll have much better leverage in the next business deals with them.”</p><p>“You’re really wise, Boss!” praised Mo Awu while raising his thumbs up.</p><p>“Hahaha.” Tang Xiu couldn’t help but burst into laughter and said, “You also learned to flatter now, Awu?”</p><p>Mo Awu let out hollow laughter in response while scratching the back of his head, saying, “Anyhow, Boss. I’ll only be able to save Daoist Zixuan if we wait for all the Celestial Wizard clan experts to join the fray. What are we gonna do with Jin Chanzi and the nine others?”</p><p>“Don’t worry about them!” said Tang Xiu. “These Celestial Wizard clansmen came for revenge in a blood vendetta, so you only need to tell them that we’re the ones who killed their clansmen. I’m sure they won’t pay much attention to Jin Chanzi and the rest.”</p><p>In the sky, Daoist Zixuan also saw the arrival of another liner. After observing it, she knew that they were from the Celestial Wizard clan, causing her to finally feel nervous. She was confident that she could escape easily should she choose to flee, but all the disciples she had trained and fostered with painstaking efforts until they reached Foundation Establishment Stage would hardly be able to survive the pursue of the Celestial Wizard clan experts.</p><p>‘What should I do now?’</p><p>Daoist Zixuan was anxious and restless. She couldn’t watch her ten pupils have any tragedy. She brought up all of them, taught them cultivation art and how to cultivate it, and watched them grow up in the process. In her heart, Jin Chanzi and his martial brothers and sisters were her children.</p><p>The Blask Soloch trio originally wanted to chase Daoist Zixuan, but after they found that their clansmen had caught up, they immediately gave up on the idea since the Grand Elder who held higher standing than them was on that ship.</p><p>“Welcome Grand Elder!”</p><p>The three old men landed on the incoming liner and respectfully greeted the old man sitting on the chair looking past his prime, Astraeus Soloch. The latter’s eyelids opened, and he glanced over at the three old men before finally laying his eyes on Blask Soloch, asking, “You’re injured?”</p><p>“The enemy is a very formidable Chinese cultivator, Grand Elder,” said Blask Soloch with a bitter expression. “I’m not her match at all, so I used Blood Hex in the fight.”</p><p>This made Astraeus Soloch’s expression slightly changed and he said with a heavy voice, “You’re too reckless. Conjuring the Blood Hex will damage your life force and it will be very difficult for you to break through to the realm of Wizard Avus for the rest of your life.”</p><p>“Rest assured, Grand Elder.” Blask Soloch hurriedly said, “I happened to get an Obscurum Magus Fructus when I was traveling many years ago. I can make up for the shortened lifespan by taking this fruit.”</p><p>Astraeus Soloch looked surprised and nodded. “I see. Then you can ignore the effect of using Blood Hex since you have the Obscurum Magus Fructus. But still, the lifespan you can recover by this fruit is only a few hundred years. Unless it’s absolutely necessary, you are not to chant the Blood Hex again.”</p><p>“I understand,” replied Blask Soloch hurriedly.</p><p>Afterward, Astraeus Soloch slowly looked up. His eyes looked immensely deep, as though they contained infinite mystery within. Even though Daoist Zixuan was standing thousands of meters away in the sky, he could still clearly see her.</p><p>“Come down!”</p><p>His voice torrentially transmitted far away and eventually was carried into Daoist Zixuan’s ears.</p><p>The latter fell into silence for a moment before she finally floated down from the sky. After she landed on her ship, she shot a look at Astraeus Soloch a kilometer away and sneered, “No wonder the Celestial Wizard clan acts so bold and dares to take my Whole Unitary Sect as an enemy, huh? It turns out that it was because of you, the Grand Elder of the Celestial Wizard clan, Astraeus Soloch. It’s been a few centuries, so I’m really curious as to why an old fart like you hasn’t died yet.”</p><p>“Ah, it’s been 300 years since we last met; right, Daoist Zixuan?” replied Astraeus with a light smile. “I really didn’t expect that you’d be as beautiful as you were then.”</p><p>“I’m still beautiful as ever indeed, but you’re about to become an old Skeleton, Astraeus,” sneered Daoist Zixuan. “Do you really want to tear all of the decorum with my Whole Unitary Sect?”</p><p>“There’s no need to lose all decorum between us.” Astraeus Soloch shook his head. “Your Whole Unitary Sect resides in the East region, far away from my Celestial Wizard clan. But still, two elders of my clan have been killed here; hence, it’s a must for my clan to find the murderer to avenge their deaths. If you killed those two elders of my clan, then I’ll put the fault on you, and your sect and my clan will no longer be decent and will settle this feud with battle.”</p><p>Daoist Zixuan was silent for a moment and coldly hmphed, “Hmph. I already told your men that we’re not the ones who killed your clansmen, yet my disciples and those two clansmen of yours had feuds regardless. If you want to put this account on our head, then bring it on.”</p><p>“A feud? What feud are you talking about?” asked Astraeus Soloch with raised brows.</p><p>“Your Celestial Wizard clansmen massacred ordinary people, which is not something I can tolerate either,” answered Daoist Zixuan. “Murderers are murderers. Now that they killed ordinary people, then they must be prepared to be killed by stronger people as well.”</p><p>“Stronger people, huh?” Astraeus Soloch snorted and said, “Who are the powerhouses you’re referring to?”</p><p>“I won’t tell you.” Daoist Zixuan shook her head.</p><p>Astraeus Soloch’s figure suddenly floated up and instantly appeared above the sea tens of meters away from Daoist Zixuan. His feet then landed on the surface of the sea, yet the ocean didn’t even wet his boots. He calmly shot a deep stare at Daoist Zixuan while faintly smiling. “Since you don’t want to tell me about it, I’ll force it out of your mouth. It’s been 300 years since our last encounter. I really wanna know how strong the proud woman of the Whole Unitary Sect is currently.”</p><p>This time, Daoist Zixuan’s complexion changed. She could tell that this old man’s cultivation was definitely not inferior to hers. Given the aura emitting out from Astraeus, he must’ve broken through the realm of Magus Avus. From what she knew about the Celestial Wizard clan, those at the Magus Avus Realm were comparable to powerhouses at the Golden Core Stage for cultivators.</p><p>“You wanna fight? Then let’s go!”</p><p>Daoist Zixuan grabbed the long swords on Jin Chanzi’s back. Suddenly, a huge aura erupted from her once again. As she glared at Astraeus Soloch, she didn’t hurry to move, and instead wanted her disciples to evacuate safely first.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
