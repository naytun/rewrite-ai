He made up his mind, making a plan to establish a relationship with the Whole Unitary Sect right after he learned this sect’s situation, and if possible, he would obtain some cultivation resources from this sect which had thousands of years of rich heritage.</p><p>The Everlasting Feast Hall itself was not in short supply of cultivation resources at the moment; it even had enough inventory for the next year. But the number of cultivation resources to carry out his plan to raise an army of cultivators while simultaneously raising and training a large number of children in the future would be astronomical. Hence, the more resources he procured, the better.</p><p>From Jin Chanzi and his five brothers, as well Daoist Zixuan now, Tang Xiu could tell that they were from a righteous sect. He had been secretly observing them and confirmed that they were not people with wicked and scheming minds, so making a deal with them was unlikely to go wrong.</p><p>“Senior Zixuan, since you’re interested in the deal I offer you, may I know how many cultivation resources your sect have accumulated in the past millennium?” asked Tang Xiu seriously. “I need to know whether it can meet my needs.”</p><p>“Ah, Daoist Tang has quite a big appetite it seems.” Daoist Zixuan let out a faint smile and said, “You just said that my Whole Unitary Sect has accumulated cultivation resources for over a thousand years. With such a long time, we indeed have accumulated a lot of resources. However, I’d like you to ask in return. What kind of benefits will you offer our Whole Unitary Sect in exchange for our massive cultivation resources?”</p><p>Tang Xiu spread his hand out, and an ancient scripture suddenly appeared on his palm. He looked at Daoist Zixuan’s curious face and asked, “I don’t know the level of cultivation art the Whole Unitary Sect has, so I’d like to ask how high the realm of cultivation one can achieve in your sect?”</p><p>With a slightly shifted expression, Daoist Zixuan thought for a while and said, “Frankly speaking, the most important cultivation art my sect has can make one break through to the Spirit Formation Stage. There’s none at the said realm in my sect at the moment, but we do have some powerhouses at the Nascent Soul Stage.”</p><p>“This ancient manual in my hand is a cultivation art that can make you breakthrough to the Great Ascension Stage,” said Tang Xiu with a smile. “Also, I can assure you that this cultivation is much more profound than any art your Whole Unitary Sect may possess. Additionally, I can also trade a cultivation art at the Crossing Tribulation Stage with your sect should anyone from the Whole Unitary Sect break through to the late stage of Great Ascension.”</p><p>“Say what?”</p><p>Daoist Zixuan had been cultivating for centuries and had a firm and tempered mind. Despite that, she was still shocked as disbelief obviously filled her face upon hearing Tang Xiu’s words.</p><p>The Great Ascension and Crossing Tribulation Stages?</p><p>Is it possible that such profound cultivation art still exists on Earth nowadays?</p><p>“What I told you is the whole truth. The manual in my hands now is a cultivation art up to the Great Ascension Stage, while I also have its continuation to the Crossing Tribulation Stage,” said Tang Xiu. “If your Whole Unitary Sect wants to get one, I need to know how many cultivation resources you can exchange to satisfy my needs.”</p><p>Daoist Zixuan’s eyes were fixated at the cultivation manual in Tang Xiu’s hands. If it wasn’t the fact that she was on Nine Dragons Island and she had no confidence in dealing with Tang Xiu at the moment, she would have moved and snatched it immediately. If these cultivation arts were as profound, or even stronger, than her sect’s cultivation technique as Tang Xiu said, then it was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity that was equivalent to the utmost valuable treasure for her Whole Unitary Sect.</p><p>“This matter is of great importance, Daoist Tang, so I need to discuss it with the elders in my sect first.”</p><p>Putting away the cultivation manual, Tang Xiu then replied with a smile, “That’s not a problem. I don’t have many cultivation resources, but I have time. However, I’m not one who likes to waste time, so how long do I need to wait to know how much cultivation resources your Whole Unitary Sect can exchange with me?”</p><p>“Seven days,” answered Daoist Zixuan without hesitation. “Give me at most seven days of time. I’ll leave now to return to my sect and discuss this matter with the elders. A week later, I’ll come again and give you a reply as to how much we can afford to exchange with you. But I hope you don’t deceive me, Daoist Tang—or my elders will be furious, spelling bad things for us.”</p><p>“If so, then I’ll be waiting for good news from you, Senior Zixuan,” said Tang Xiu smilingly.</p><p>Immediately after, Daoist Zixuan said, “Daoist Tang, I heard from my young disciples that you have deep attainments in the Lightning Evoker Art, which I have some mastery in as well. Would you mind sparing some time to compare notes?”</p><p>“Since Senior Zixuan has such interest, shall we go to the sea outside then?” said Tang Xiu smilingly. “I don’t want this newly reconstructed Nine Dragons Island to be destroyed by us.”</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Quickly after, Tang Xiu opened the portal of the island’s array so that he and Daoist Zixuan could flash outside, leaving the rest of the people to appear several kilometers away from Nine Dragons Island.</p><p>While floating in the air, Daoist Zixuan looked at Tang Xiu dozens of meters away from her as she seriously said, “Please be careful, Daoist Tang!”</p><p>BANG…</p><p>Just as her voice faded away, thunder roared from the firmament and dark clouds began to emerge, covering hundreds of square meters. A series of numerous lightning sparks followed, but each bolt was very thin, the thickest just thumb-sized.</p><p>Tang Xiu smirked with a slight contempt while watching the lightning magic conjured by Daoist Zixuan. He was thinking whether he had to show off his fullest power or not since he also needed to showcase a shocking display that would act as a deep deterrent to Daoist Zixuan. He was afraid that this female would look down on him and pay him no attention in the next transaction should he avoid doing so.</p><p>After all, his lightning conjuration magic was too mysterious. Added with his current cultivation which was comparable to the late stage of Golden Core, the might that it produced was something that not even any Nascent Soul or Soul Formation powerhouses could achieve. Yet, if he were to expose too much, it would make Daoist Zixuan think that his Lightning Evoker Art was very powerful, thus inciting her greed and probably driving her to make a bad move.</p><p>‘Haih, whatever. I’ll just expose the level of power I used when dealing with those two old farts from Celestial Wizard clan then!’</p><p>After he made up his mind, the display of ability showcased by Daoist Zixuan also ended. At this time, his figure streaked into the sky and appeared hundreds of meters above the surface of the sea. He stretched his arms out and the dispersing dark clouds in the sky began to gather again. The number and intensity of the dark clouds now were even more substantial than the ones produced by Daoist Zixuan’s lightning conjuration magic prior, also covering a much larger radius in the sky.</p><p>Thunder rumbled and lightning flashed amid the dark clouds hung over in the sky. For whoever looked up at the sky, it was like the world was waiting for the arrival of doomsday. Lightning flashes were looming in the clouds and the rumbling of thunderclaps sent shocks that pierced the eardrums.</p><p>Flashing backward for hundreds of meters away from the area, Daoist Zixuan looked up and stared at the sky dumbfoundedly with her body slightly trembling. The current scene before her was something out of her expectation. What’s more, it was just a phenomenon created by the conjuration of lightning art, no less.</p><p>“H-how… how is he able to achieve this? What kind of profound Lightning Art has he been cultivating exactly? This phenomenon alone has exceeded my wildest imagination already; how terrifying is the level of power when it blasts out?”</p><p>“Lightning Ocean!”</p><p>Standing at hundreds of meters mid-air, Tang Xiu’s shout suddenly rumbled in the sky. All of a sudden, lightning bolts the size of an arm flashed down from the layers of cloud like countless falling meteors from the night sky, blasting the distant sea surface. The lightning blasts covered a half kilometer radius, and whether it was its number, speed, or might, it was at least 10 times stronger than the ones displayed by Daoist Zixuan.</p><p>The lightning bolts flashed down and the phenomenon lasted for a minute. The moment the lightning downpour stopped, the dark clouds in the firmament dissipated and the rumbling thunderclaps were also disappeared. At the same time, the half kilometer area that was baptized by lighting bolts was now covered by a massive number of dead sea creatures. The more time passed, the more dead fish came floating onto the surface.</p><p>Tang Xiu then flew to the front of Daoist Zixuan and looked at her dazed beautiful face, saying with a faint smile, “It seems my lightning conjuration magic is much better than yours. That’s right, I also heard from your disciple, Jin Chanzi, that you’re very obsessed with lightning magic. We can also have an exchange if you want to learn more advanced lightning magic from me.”</p><p>Daoist Zixuan returned back to her senses and looked at the faintly smiling Tang Xiu. But now, admiration had birthed inside her heart. She was not afraid of Tang Xiu if they had to have a mortal combat since lightning magic was not the only power she possessed. But she had to admit Tang Xiu’s mastery on this aspect and was convinced by him.</p><p>“Then I’ll hold onto your words today, Daoist Tang,” said Daoist Zixuan seriously. “I’ll bring a lot of cultivation resources when I come again later, so don’t take back your words later.”</p><p>“Don’t worry!” Tang Xiu nodded and said, “I won’t take it back.”</p><p>After a long while, Tang Xiu returned back to Nine Dragons Island, whereas Daoist Zixuan brought her ten disciples and left on the liner. Therefore, there was no one from the Whole Unitary Sect staying on the island anymore. The rest of the remaining people were now Tang Xiu’s subordinates.</p><p>Just as Tang Xiu arrived outside the palace, Mo Awen appeared in front of him and reported with a solemn face, “We got news from the 14th island, Boss. Our men have spotted two liners cruising towards us not far away from them. Also, judging from the direction of Daoist Zixuan’s departure, they are bound to run into these two liners within two hours.”</p><p>“Have you confirmed the identity of these people?” asked Tang Xiu with a frown.</p><p>“I don’t have 100% certainty, but the report from our men on the 14th island said that these people wear the same attire as those two Celestial Wizards killed by us,” answered Mo Awen.</p><p>“If these people are really from the Celestial Wizard clan, then our time to play has come,” sneered Tang Xiu. “Notify everyone and prepare the choppers for taking off. I want all Foundation Establishment members to board the choppers in 10 minutes and head to the 14th island. It seems like the battlefield I need has finally been delivered.”</p><p>“Your order will be carried out immediately, Boss,” said Mo Awen. “However, casualties among our men will be inevitable once the battle begins. While we are currently recruiting men, if we lose too many men, I’m afraid…”</p><p>“It’s quality that counts in an army, so what are you afraid of?” sneered Tang Xiu. “Don’t you also understand that only in battles can you sharpen yourself and make rapid progress in your cultivation and practical experience?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
