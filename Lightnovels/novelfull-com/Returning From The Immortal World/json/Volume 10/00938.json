He nearly burst into laughter upon seeing how panicked and horrified they were.</p><p>It’s been 13 years.</p><p>It was the time he had been confined in mental training that nearly choked him to death. And thus, the moment he came to Shanghai from Jingmen Island, he could be said to have turned into a talker. He gossipped with the girl who sold tickets, chatted with the tourists on the bus, talked with the driver, and even had chit-chat with the security guards at the gate. Shortly put, he literally spewed out anything he had in mind and was unwilling to miss any chance to chat with anyone.</p><p>It was because of the phrase, “a day in heaven is equal to a year on Earth”.</p><p>Only now did he thoroughly understand what this line meant. Back when he came to the Everlasting Feast Hall’s HQ in Jingmen Island, a celestial maiden-like woman threw him into a bizarre array. What was more unbelievable was that he had experienced years inside. It wasn’t until he came out of the array that he found out that it was a time-accelerating array, and the woman who did that to him was called Gu Yan’er—his Boss’s disciple!</p><p>“That’s right. I was just reminded of something, though.”</p><p>Spectre blinked to watch the horrified faces and spoke to them all of a sudden.</p><p>Wang Wei gulped down and frightfully replied stutteringly, “W-what… w-what did you just recall?”</p><p>Spectre ruminated for a while and grinningly said, “Well, ever since I set my feet into the assassination world, I think I always rip off the heads of those who happen to see me. I think I stabbed their hearts and cut off their limbs, each and every one of them. You just said that you once saw me kill my target, didn’t you? Hmm… what should I do? Should I cut off your head, stab your heart, or chop your limbs off? Man… this multiple-choice question really gives me a headache.”</p><p>“NO, NO, NO! Please don’t!!!” Wang Wei screamed out in horror. “Please spare me! It’s all my fault. I shouldn’t have poked my nose out and provoked your Boss before. Please, I apologize. I’ll see him at once to apologize. I’ll do it even if I have to kneel and kowtow to him.”</p><p>He was truly frightened. And while this fear did come from Spectre, it was also Tang Xiu who gave him much of this horror. Who was Spetre in the first place? He was the ruthless ghost, the best assassin in the world that even those heads of the state were very afraid of. And yet, such a ruthless man was actually Tang Xiu’s henchman. That was simply unthinkable.</p><p>At this moment, he was so scared to hear how terrifying the power possessed by Tang Xiu was, which definitely had reached an unthinkable terrifying level! He was still so young and death was far from being his wish, so he could only cast his pride away. He bent down and knelt, begging for mercy and hoping to keep his life.</p><p>Spectre just grinned in response, “Well, my Boss actually likes money so much, though. I may regard money like dirt, but not him! It’s just that I don’t know how much your life is worth, so tell me how much it is—and I’ll only give one chance!”</p><p>Only then did Wang Wei’s face looked extremely relieved and joyful as he blurted out without hesitation, “240 million, which is all the fortune I have. I’ll transfer it to you right away as long as you don’t kill me… no to your Boss’s account.”</p><p>Yang Yang was now left dumbstruck. He was a rich man as well, but practicing martial arts had been his focus all his life so he didn’t go all out to seek fortune. Let alone 240 million, he didn’t even have a tenth of that amount.</p><p>“C-can you… please give me some time? I have no money now, but I have a wealthy family. I’ll call my house to ask for the money immediately… P-please, give me some time. I’ll prepare the amount as needed,” said Yang Yang with a bitter face.</p><p>Spectre rolled his eyes as his answer and said, “Then you must also take out 240 million. A penny less means your life is much cheaper than this guy. I couldn’t care less about the likes of a cheap life.”</p><p>Yang Yang shuddered violently. He immediately grabbed his phone, dialed a cell number, and anxiously spoke in a hurry, “Mother, I need money—240 million. Please don’t ask me what for and why now. I can only tell you that it’s concerning my life and death. Just transfer it to the man, or you’ll only see my dead body.</p><p>“What happened to you, Son?” a hushed and anxious voice came replying.</p><p>Yang Yang’s voice hiked up and he hastily cried out, “Please don’t ask about it now, Mom! Just hurry up and transfer the money! Only that money can save me now.”</p><p>“Alright, alright! Don’t worry. I’ll transfer it to you immediately,” a panicked voice came replying again.</p><p>Yang Yang hung up and cautiously looked at Spectre and said, “The money will be transferred soon. Please… just wait.”</p><p>“Hehe…” Spectre let out strange laughter and then said, “Well, well. You both seem to value your life. Alright, seeing that you’re so sincere to pay, I’ll spare you guys, but… my rule is still on and must never be broken. I don’t give a fuck how powerful the forces behind you two are. You dare to reveal even a word about me, then I guarantee you will see your maker, including your family members!”</p><p>“Yes, yes. We’ll definitely keep our mouth shut!”</p><p>“We won’t dare do anything.”</p><p>Yang Yang and Wang Wei frightfully promised and pleaded.</p><p>“Just prepare the money and give it to my Boss when you personally apologize to him,” said Spectre with a happy smile.</p><p>With that said, his figure vanished in an instant.</p><p>Yang Yang and Wang Wei exchanged glances. After a very long while, the former muttered to himself, “Is he a ghost, or a human? How come he’s just vanished like that?”</p><p>“He didn’t disappear out of thin air. It’s just that he’s too fast and our naked eyes can’t see him,” said Wang Wei bitterly. “Spectre is the first and the best assassin in the world, to begin with. Perhaps, he’s the only one who possesses such a horrifying speed. What you said is right, Yang Yang. We just provoked a very frightening existence, so we indeed deserve it.”</p><p>“Yeah.” Yang Yang nodded and took a deep breath.</p><p>****</p><p>Deeper inside Paradise Manor was a European-style building near the woods. Yang Pengchao and Yue Li stood before the windows, waiting for Tang Xiu’s arrival. Behind them was a middle-aged woman with a pale face, who looked fragile while leaning on the bedside. Her eyes, however, were full of eagerness for living.</p><p>She had been inquiring about all the issues relating to the Young Divine Doctor Tang Xiu in the last few days. What she found made her spirit to keep on living, which was originally dying out inside her, light up again, as though she saw a beacon of light to continue on living.</p><p>“Pengchao, Lili, has Divine Doctor Tang come yet?” Cui Yanru watched the back of the two teenagers and asked.</p><p>The duo turned around and Yue Li was the one who answered, “Divine Doctor Tang said that he’d be here in an hour, Mom. I’m sure he’ll be here since he’s someone whose words can be trusted.”</p><p>“That’s right, Auntie. Lili tells the truth.” Yang Pengchang also nodded and said, “Divine Doctor Tang is someone who upholds his promises. He’ll definitely deliver on his promise. Please rest your worries he’ll probably arrive soon.”</p><p>“Alright. It’s just that I’m rather impatient and anxious.” Cui Yanru nodded and said, “However, there’s something I want to discuss with you both before Divine Doctor Tang comes.”</p><p>“Please tell us, Auntie,” said Yang Pengchao.</p><p>“Pengchao, you also know what kind of illness I have and how I got it, Pengchao. The chance for me to survive is so slim. I don’t doubt the medicine expertise Divine Doctor Tang has, but the chance that severe leukemia can be cured is very unlikely. If… I mean… if, in the case that Divine Doctor Tang cannot cure me, I really hope you can take good care of Lili in the future. I know my daughter. She has chosen you, so she will follow you to the end.”</p><p>“I believe that Divine Doctor Tang will be able to cure you, Auntie,” replied Yang Pengchao. “But you can also rest assured that I’ll definitely carry out your wishes. I’ll never give up on Yue Li no matter what happens to us in the future. I’ll take good care of her.”</p><p>Cui Yanru nodded with a satisfied and pleased face, “Lili is truly blessed!”</p><p>Yue Li went to the bedside and sat beside her, saying, “You’ll definitely able to live for a long time, Mom. I believe that. Pengchao’s parents have already passed away and he has no relatives left, so there’s only you now. We’ll be filial to you and take care of you in the future. Therefore, you must be strong and must believe in Divine Doctor Tang to actively cooperate in the treatment. I believe that you’ll be fine in no time.”</p><p>“Alright…”</p><p>Near the window, Yang Pengchao turned his head and looked outside without a word. He then suddenly saw a pleasant surprise as he quickly cried out, “That’s Divine Doctor Tang. He’s coming. Lili, accompany Auntie here. I’m going to greet him.”</p><p>“There’s no need to do so.”</p><p>Tang Xiu’s voice suddenly entered Yang Pengchao’s ear all of a sudden.</p><p>In just a few seconds, the door was pushed as Tang Xiu and Ouyang Lulu came inside in strides.</p><p>“You, you…”</p><p>Yang Pengchao was totally stunned. He dared swear to Heaven that Tang Xiu and Ouyang Lulu were still on the pathway outside this European-styled building a few moments ago. That was tens of meters away. But how did they get here upstairs in just a few seconds? How was it possible for them appear before him so fast? Not even the fastest sprinter in the world, the winner of the 100m dash, could do it!</p><p>Tang Xiu blinked at him with a faint smile. Then, he looked Cui Yanru on the patient bed and smilingly said, “You must be Yue Li’s mother, right? I’m Tang Xiu, and this is Ouyang Lulu.”</p><p>Cui Yanru struggled to get up, but Tang Xiu stopped him so that she was leaning on the bedhead. Then she gratefully said, “I’ve heard your name for a very long time, Divine Doctor Tang. Also, Proprietress Lulu has been very kind to look after us for the last few days. You both are good people. Thank you.”</p><p>“There’s no need to thank us,” replied Tang Xiu with a smile. “If you want to thank someone, thank Yang Pengchao. He’s a good young man who has a fine future ahead of him.”</p><p>“I’ve already given my consent to both of them,” said Cui Yanru. “I already know Pengchao is a good young man, so I can feel relieved to hand over Lili to him even if I have to leave this world.”</p><p>Tang Xiu went to the bed and reached out to pick her hand and check her pulse, “You won’t die with me here unless you yourself commit suicide. Besides, it’s not like leukemia is an incurable disease, although there have been some cases that were difficult to treat.”</p><p>After a half-minute passed by, Tang Xiu took out a porcelain insulator and handed it to Yue Li, “There’s a drop of medicinal liquid inside made by myself. Just pour a drop of this medicinal liquid into warm water and let your mother take a bath in it. Please remember, the process will be very painful, but she must endure it. She should be able to hold on for 10 minutes given her current physique. After she comes out of the bathtub, you can also have a shower with the water. It’ll be of great benefit to you too.”</p><p>“Ehh?” Yue Li blanked out and asked, “I need to take a shower too?”</p><p>“This medicinal liquid not only has an effect on your mother, but is also very good on you,” explained Tang Xiu. “As long as you can endure soaking yourself inside the water for 10 minutes, you’ll have your physical fitness greatly improved.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
