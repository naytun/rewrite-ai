Be it by him impaling the opponent’s heart, or by the flame arrow that hit the old man’s chest, the black-robed old man was severely injured. This time, instead of spraying out black fog, the old man gushed out black and greyish blood.</p><p>“Big Brother!!!”</p><p>The other black-robed old man immediately waved his magic staff upon seeing his situation, creating a giant tiger made of black fog that forced Mo Awu to have no choice but to retreat to Tang Xiu tens of meters away.</p><p>The old man didn’t pursue, and instead quickly took a porcelain bottle out from his inner pocket and retrieved a gray-black pill from the inside, forcefully stuffing it into the injured old man. A black fog was then released from the slit of his fingers and constantly fused into the injured old man’s heart.</p><p>A few kilometers away from the scene, six youths carrying swords in black wushu suits were under the lead of the Everlasting Feast Hall’s experts as they marched in strides toward the hilltop. They also clearly saw the scene of the fight a moment ago.</p><p>The youth in the lead had eyes sparkling upon witnessing the fight as he turned his head and said in a low voice, “They’re using flying swords. It seems that they’re also cultivators just like us. Those five men who just attacked are not that strong and may be weaker than us, but the last one is very formidable and has comparable strength to us. I didn’t expect that we’d run into so many cultivators, especially on an island amid the boundless sea like this. It seems that our Master is incorrect. There turns out to be many cultivators in the world.”</p><p>A youth next to him nodded and added, “You’re right, Brother. I guess it’s because Master has always been in seclusion for a long time, so she doesn’t know the situation about the outside world. Our sect moved to Singapore from China, but China itself has a long history and boasts such a large population. It’s bound that talented people will also appear from the masses. We were just traveling this time and found those two wizards committing murder, finally catching them at this place. Let’s try not to have any conflict between us and these cultivators if not necessary.”</p><p>“Yeah. I got it.” the first youth nodded without speaking much.</p><p>Atop the boulder, the injured black-robed man, Wznieść Soloch, raised his hand to erase the grayish-black bloodstains around his mouth and said, “Relax. Our life nucleus is not in the heart. I won’t die even if he twists and smashes my heart into pieces. But you gotta be careful with them. The fire these people unleashed is not the likes of fire elementals, but is likely the fire element of magicians.”</p><p>Wykres Soloch nodded with a solemn face and replied, “They may be insignificant, but their power is indeed nothing to scoff at. Also, we just lost one black dragon and the other one is severely injured. Just like you, I won’t be able to continue to fight soon as well.”</p><p>“Let’s negotiate with them. We must remain on this island no matter what,” said Wznieść Soloch with a nod. “We have contacted everyone else in our Celestial Wizard clan. So long as we stay on this island, our people will catch up as fast as possible. At that time, no matter how strong these people are, I don’t think there’s any possibility that they will be able to contend with our clan. It’s not too late for us to have our revenge then.”</p><p>Wykres Soloch pondered about it for a moment. Then, he raised his head to look at Tang Xiu and the rest dozens of meters away from them and shouted, “Don’t you think it’s too extreme to bully us by relying on your numbers here? You can expect a lot of people from my Celestial Wizard clan to come here in less than two days. Keep your arrogance by then and my clan will drive you out and kill you all.”</p><p>“Hahaha…”</p><p>This made Tang Xiu burst into laughter, and his figure flashed and appeared several meters away from Wykres Soloch. He spared a glance at the last giant python around the two men that protected them inside. Then, he immediately said with a heavy voice, “Every country has its own territory, and so does every clan. I told you this island is my private territory. I’ve spent a fortune to buy it, as well as invested huge capital, manpower, and resources for its construction. Now you’ve come to my site and unexpectedly want to drive us out? What kind of fucking reasoning are you spitting out?”</p><p>“I told you that we’ll buy this island from you,” retorted Wznieść Soloch with a deep voice. “The children of my Celestial Wizard clan gave us a lot of money. It should be enough to cover all your expenses.”</p><p>“Heh!” Tang Xiu responded in a sneer, “Now tell me;if I like your Celestial Wizard clan’s territory—for instance, your clan’s land—would you be willing to sell your land to me if I want to buy it?”</p><p>“Ugh…” Wznieść Soloch was stunned and rendered speechless.</p><p>His Celestial Wizard clan had occupied and lived on their land for thousands of years. They would never sell it even if they were offered countless mountains of gold!</p><p>“What do you say?” Tang Xiu sneered again. “Cat got your tongue so you can’t answer it? Hmph, you’re nothing but damned bandits with your attitude of robbing others of their possessions. Know what you can do and what you can’t and get the fuck out of this place at once. Tell your Celestial Wizard clan to fuck off and never step on my Nine Dragons Island; else, we’ll be mortal enemies. Once we are, I can slaughter your whole clan when I unleash all the power I have in hand!”</p><p>Threat! A bare and bold threat!</p><p>Had it been declared by someone else, the two brothers Wznieść Soloch and Wykres Soloch would have scoffed at it and responded in contempt. But it was coming from Tang Xiu, sending a quake to their hearts, causing them to have no choice but to act more cautious.</p><p>It was because they didn’t know Tang Xiu’s origins, plus the fact that this young man had so many experts as subordinates, forcing them to face the threat as a serious matter.</p><p>“Who exactly are you?” asked Wykres Soloch in a deep voice.</p><p>“You have no qualification to know who I am,” answered Tang Xiu apathetically. “What you need to know is that I can erase your life today if I really wish to. Even if I’m bent on removing your entire Celestial Wizard clan from the face of the earth, no matter if your clan escapes from Earth, I still have the means to annihilate you all!”</p><p>Wykres Soloch and Wznieść Soloch exchanged glances. They didn’t believe Tang Xiu’s claims, yet the boasting still made them feel a bit downcast. The latter then spoke again, “We can move a step back. What we just need is the dragon stone in the center of the island. Once we get it, we’ll leave immediately.”</p><p>Dragon stone?!</p><p>Now, Tang Xiu wasn’t trying to hide the killing intent blazing in his eyes. The so-called dragon stone was the core of the dragon’s vein, exactly its essence. Once it was taken away, the Feng Shui that once blessed this land would disappear, turning this place into nothing but ordinary due to the dissipating dragon’s vein and the declining Heaven and Earth spiritual qi.</p><p>“Kill them!”</p><p>Sending an order in a shout, Tang Xiu took the lead and instantly unleashed his divine sword, flying over to the two men while brandishing it lightning fast. The instant the sword flew over, a tens of meters long sword beam came slashing down at the two old men and directly shattered the boulder behind them.</p><p>“KILL!”</p><p>Tens of guards who accompanied Tang Xiu to come here, including Mo Awu’s group, followed suit, whereas Mo Awen and several core experts of the Everlasting Feast Hall also unleashed their flying swords for the first time. Killing aura erupted and besieged both Wznieść Soloch and Wykres Soloch within.</p><p>“Damn! How can you be so strong?!”</p><p>Getting straightly injured by the sword energy, Wykres Soloch coughed up grey blood and roared in alarm. He could only watch his heavily injured brother, Wznieść Soloch, being swept over by the sword energy, leaving a wide wound and causing his blood to spring out. Even the giant python that protected them was directly killed.</p><p>Regret and remorse filled his whole person like a tide that was drowning him within. Only then did he realize that he just made a fatal mistake—underestimating Tang Xiu’s power. He also realized that what made Tang Xiu’s killing intent flare up was because he demanded the “dragon stone”, this island’s secret.</p><p>“Gotta flee!”</p><p>He glanced to the northwest before he immediately returned to his big brother, Wznieść Soloch, and grabbed his arm in an attempt to escape to the northeast.</p><p>It was a pity for him that his fast speed was much slower than Tang Xiu and Mo Awu’s group, both flying on their swords. In just a few seconds, the brothers were surrounded by flickering flying swords that vehemently began to strike them in intricate flying paths.</p><p>“PLEASE STOP! WE’LL GIVE UP ON THE DRAGON STONE!”</p><p>Wykres Soloch could only resist and fend off the bombardments for several seconds as he cried out to these experts.</p><p>The divine sword manipulated by Tang Xiu transformed into torrential layers of sword beams. Layers of sword beams were as though continuous waves that constantly assaulted Wykres Soloch and Wznieść Soloch.</p><p>“You go and run away! Quickly!”</p><p>Wznieść Soloch, who had been fatally injured, suddenly blasted out a terrifying aura. He suddenly grabbed Wykres Soloch and unleashed all of his strength to throw him to the northeast. Yet, at this instant, several flying swords pierced his body. His body began to bulge like a rubber ball while a black fog formed a twister that swirled around him.</p><p>“You want to kill me? Then be ready to be buried with me. I’ll drag you all to hell with me!”</p><p>Wznieść Soloch let out a grim grin and exploded his body. The twister formed by the grayish-black fog instantly burst out and expanded tenfold, engulfing several weaker members of the island guards.</p><p>“DRAW BACK! This black fog is poisonous!”</p><p>Tang Xiu’s skin was exposed to the black fog and his expression instantly changed upon seeing its potent corrosiveness. He decisively conjured a secret art, causing a heavy rain to suddenly pour down from the sky in the surroundings. At the same time, he also released a stream of Primal Chaos power to wrap the waist of a man and push him away to the distance.</p><p>Not far away from the scene, the six youths were all looking shocked. They were just slightly surprised when Mo Awu and Jin Shi’s team acted. But when Tang Xiu went into action, they could instantly tell that Tang Xiu was much stronger than they were.</p><p>“How could he be this strong? Not even all the powerhouses at the Golden Core Stage are able to do that, right? But Master said that there should be no other cultivators on Earth who have cultivated to the Golden Core Stage nowadays,” muttered one youth to himself with a slightly pale face.</p><p>Beside him, another youth gulped down while staring with shocked and bulging eyes at the intense battle. “He’s very strong. I don’t think that our Master can even contend with this man. No way any cultivator at the Foundation Establishment Stage can do that!”</p><p>As their voices faded away, the two youths exchanged glances and their paces abruptly came to a halt.</p><p>If Tang Xiu’s age was just like those middle-aged men involved in the battle, they would’ve been able to reluctantly accept it. After all, he could have been a senior who had been cultivating for many years. But Tang Xiu was much too young, just a few years older than them. It was a hard blow to them as people who used to be proud and arrogant, causing them to be somewhat unable to accept it.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
