He did have the intention to retreat as Tang Xiu said and naturally didn’t want to waste time arguing. He gave a gesture to retreat, and the two handsome vampire-looking Caucasian men instantly grabbed Singkuo’s shoulder and dashed backward all of a sudden along with the rest of them.</p><p>“The power of Dharma is endless—let Sea of Flames Burn the Demons!”</p><p>The Buddhist staff in Death Dhyana Buddhist Master’s hand fiercely swept away. A black flame instantly set ablaze as he smashed several black metal balls to his front. A black mist then suddenly spread out in all directions as the balls exploded.</p><p>The black flame seemed like a flame being ignited by kerosene as it touched the black mist. In but a moment, the black flame blazed in the dark of the night. At the same time, however, the blazing black flame combusted in a large area and posed as a great obstruction to Tang Xiu and the rest.</p><p>Suddenly, Singluen paced a step forward and quickly grabbed a sharp dagger, cutting his finger. He forced several drops of his own blood to drip and threw it toward the black flame in front. At the same time, his other hand formed a seal while casting an incantation. In just a few breaths, the drops of blood he threw ignited and turned into a black flame that looked similar to the sea of fire in front of everyone.</p><p>“Mr. Tang, please lead everyone to chase them quickly. I just cast a forbidden art of my clan so that you can open a passage in this sea of fire,” shouted Singluen hurriedly. His profile looked somewhat pale.</p><p>Tang Xiu’s eyes lit up, and he shouted without hesitation, “Everyone, CHASE! We must completely kill them today—else, there will be endless troubles later!”</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>Numerous figures flickered and moved lightning fast toward the passageway amid the sea of fire. The path created by Singluen in the sea of black flame could be said to be very perfect. In less than half a minute, nearly everyone present had crossed the passage and escaped from the sea of black flame.</p><p>“Lotus Sword!”</p><p>Overlapping layers of sword images from an immortal sword bloomed like lotus flowers. The flashing of cold light glittered even in the dark night.</p><p>Tang An’s figure flashed and appeared in front of the Death Dhyana Buddhist Master’s group of seven. She was hardly able to block their escape route. But after she unleashed the Lotus Flower sword technique, the monk instantly sensed that if he were to rashly rush into the sword light, his chance of getting out alive would be very slim.</p><p>He quickly held the Buddhist staff and hacked it forward. Light and shadow instantly burst out from his staff. The moment they clashed against the lotus made of swords, the flow of energy in the overlapping layers of sword energy turned chaotic. Right as the light and shadow dissipated, however, two figures flashed lightning-fast and appeared in front of the sword lotus.</p><p>One of the figures was a burly man in a long skirt with thick make-up caked on his face. He gave off a slightly demonic feeling. The cross flesh on his face constantly shivered, and the heavy killing intent on his face made him look particularly ferocious and devilish. At the same time, there was a youth with long hair and outlandish attire with a cross on his back as well who floated in the air and sent black smoke forward.</p><p>“Thousand Feather Needles!”</p><p>“Infernal Punishment!”</p><p>The two men joined forces and launched a fierce onslaught in an instant.</p><p>Tang An’s body warped. Spatial energy suddenly distorted the space around her, and her figure instantly vanished, only to instantly appear in the distance. Space seemed to solidify as she distorted space and time, enormously slowing down the onslaught of the monstrous man and the outlandish youth instantly. At this moment, Tang An then appeared ten meters in front of the two men. Her black-gloved hands seemed to be weaving an invisible big net, the lines of which were space cracks that came to envelop the two men.</p><p>“Spatial Power?!”</p><p>A shocked look burst out from Death Dhyana Buddhist Master’s eyes. His skeleton-like figure suddenly rushed forward. The moment that he was a few meters away from the big net, he powerfully swept away his Buddhist staff to the front and threw his necklace which had already lost a few beads. The string of Buddhist beads suddenly rose a hundred times. The string then broke and the beads exploded.</p><p>Crack!!!</p><p>The space turbulence turned more chaotic, but the big net formed by the space cracks was also collapsing before it eventually dissipated and vanished the moment it touched the devilish strongman and the outlandish youth.</p><p>Tang An’s face slightly changed. She used to fight others by ambushing them using spatial and time powers to smoothly get the upper hand. But this time, in order to block Death Dhyana Buddhist Master’s group, the monk met her attack head-on and had actually broken her technique.</p><p>“Three Thousand Slashes!”</p><p>Eyes filled with immense killing intent, Tang An manipulated her immortal sword to stir up the wind and mist in the surroundings. A wall of long swords then instantly formed and crushed down in front of her.</p><p>“JOIN POWER AND BLOCK IT!!!!”</p><p>A horrified look was cast on Death Dhyana Buddhist Master’s face as he shouted. He could sense an imminent fatal crisis headed right toward them. He instantly used everything he had at this time, frantically circulating the Dark Dharmic power in his body. His Buddhist staff suddenly elongated several times as he resolutely brandished it to the front. At the same time, the outlandish youth manipulated the cross to constantly circle at a high-speed. The black smoke seemed to turn into a ferocious devil that bared its fangs and brandished its claws against the oppressing wall of swords, while the devilish strongman made a seal with his thumbs and middle finger, forming a sharp line that looked like a sharp needle. However, due to extreme velocity that pierced the air, the black needle created an ear-piercing sound as it pierced through the onslaught of swords!</p><p>Attacking is indeed the best form of defense!</p><p>The three men were forced to join forces to use almost all their strongest moves to instantly clash against the bombardment of the sword wall formed by the Three Thousand Swords technique.</p><p>Puff…</p><p>Tang An’s body trembled, and her figure vanished into the distance. Her blood spurted out from her mouth and dyed the space where she was blood red.</p><p>The Death Dhyana Buddhist Master trio just used their bodies to form such a formation. Yet, the spatial force made them feel extremely constrained and restricted. Even though they succeeded in breaking Tang An’s onslaught, their bodies still trembled as they staggered backward for a dozen steps, feeling faintly numb in their hands that held their weapons.</p><p>“What a powerful sneaky bitch! That bitch is so young, yet cannot be scoffed at!”</p><p>The monk tried hard to calm the chaotic flow of energy in his body as he vigilantly watched the surroundings and slowly spoke.</p><p>The black woman behind the three men interjected with a grim voice, “Death Dhyana, we mustn’t force our way out and clash head-on with these people if we don’t wanna die here. They are very powerful, so it’s best for us to flee.”</p><p>As the words left her mouth, the two vampire-like handsome young men instantly rushed forward to the front. Singkuo, who was brought by them, realized that even Death Dhyana Buddhist Master, who was the most powerful man among these people, was not necessarily a match for that mysterious woman. It was a fact that he must admit, even though he was unable to acknowledge how great Tang An’s strength was.</p><p>Running away to escape this place. It was the only hope he had at this time. Even if Death Dhyana Buddhist Master’s group were all dead at the cost of protecting him in this escape, he’d be very satisfied.</p><p>At this time, he could finally realize his situation clearly. No matter how strong he’d become in the future, and no matter how many men he trained, it would be nigh impossible to have his revenge against Tang Xiu. This man was very powerful and so were his subordinates. Beyond a doubt, retaliating against him was like an egg trying to crush a boulder. However, he still had a chance to eliminate Singluen and his guardian elders completely. He could even erase the Dark Shaman Clan if Singluen were to use the clan’s power in the future.</p><p>‘There are some more left! Those fucking Singli and the 13 Shaman Guardians! They just yielded to the threats of the enemy and gave up on me. They too must die in pain by torture and endless suffering!’</p><p>Eyes full of cold, chilling thoughts, Singkuo was quickly healing himself with the faint black mist that covered his body as the two vampire-like youths grabbed him. He would be able to heal most of his injuries if he was given another ten minutes. His wounds wouldn’t affect him in any way even if he must be engaged in the fight.</p><p>A few kilometers away, atop the tens of meters high water tower, Zuo Daquan secretly heaved a sigh of relief and now looked relaxed. He turned around to glance at his men who also acted in a similar fashion, and then sighed, “Seriously, I never thought so many fearsome people like them existed in this world. We have been lucky to not provoke any of these kinds of fearsome existences while we were on the run all these years. We must be very careful in the future to not easily provoke their kind. We’ll probably be killed at a moment’s notice if we provoke such fearsome people.”</p><p>“That was a good reminder from you, Boss.” The middle-aged man nodded and forced out a bitter smile. “Comparing us with them is like ants in the face of lions. It’s useless to compare us with them. To them, killing us is just like pinching ants!”</p><p>Zuo Daquan’s eyes glittered, and he said in a heavy voice, “We mustn’t go out our way to provoke these kinds of people, yet it’s a must to find ways to improve our strength. We never knew that such fearsome people existed in this world before; hence, we felt that we were already very powerful. But now, we know that we’re like frogs in the bottom of a well looking at the sky. Anyhow, I got an idea in mind now, though I don’t know whether it’s feasible for all of you.”</p><p>“What idea do you have, Boss?” asked the middle-aged man with a confused face.</p><p>“Well, since such fearsome existences exist in this world, that means that there’s a way for us to be stronger and become powerhouses, right? I did offend Tang Xiu before. But I have Qing’er. If I can apologize and express my goodwill to him, perhaps it’s possible to build a little friendship. What do you think about the chance of me obtaining any means to become stronger from him by spending a lot of money later?”</p><p>In a flash, the few men who were loyal to Zuo Daquan had glowing eyes. It would be very great for them if their Boss truly could obtain the means to become stronger from Tang Xiu! It was a good thing that could make them wake up from their dreams laughing.</p><p>“Please try it, Boss!” said the middle-aged man with an excited face.</p><p>Zuo Daquan lifted his hand and stroked his chin slowly. Then, he nodded and said, “Such a chance must not be missed, so I must grasp it. So let’s…”</p><p>“Boss!” another man called out and interrupted him with a low voice all of a sudden.</p><p>“What’s up?” asked Zuo Daquan with knitted brows.</p><p>While pointing to another direction, the man whispered, “Another group of people is coming! Also, given the number of cars, the number of people this time is probably a lot more. It should be similar to the number of people brought by Singkuo previously.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
