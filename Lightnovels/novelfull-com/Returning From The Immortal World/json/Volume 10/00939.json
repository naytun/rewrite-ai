The medicinal liquid was also effective as a treatment for many illnesses. As long as the efficacy of this medicine entered Cui Yanru’s system, it would be able to kill all those cancerous white cells and save her from danger. The reason why he told Yue Li to soak herself inside the water was that he didn’t want to waste the medicine’s efficacy.</p><p>After Yue Li received the porcelain bottle, she asked, “I’ll definitely do what you asked of me, Divine Doctor Tang. But when are you going to treat mother?”</p><p>“I gave you that medicine; isn’t that a cure for her?” asked Tang Xiu smilingly.</p><p>“What do you mean?” Yue Li was so confused and asked again, “Just taking a bath will cure her?”</p><p>“Alright, just turn on the water now and then take your mother to have a bath,” said Tang Xiu, “You’ll know the effect after she has taken a bath. Besides, I’ll be in Paradise Manor for the time being. I’ll be back here in two hours.”</p><p>It was so difficult for Yue Li to make anything out of Tang Xiu explanation, so she just nodded in a daze, watching Tang Xiu and Ouyang Lulu leave. Then, she looked at Yang Pengchao and whispered, “Do you understand what Divine Doctor meant? I just never heard of anything like a drop of medicine curing leukemia patients, like ever. He… he wouldn’t be making fun of us, right?”</p><p>“He’ll never make fun of us for no reason at all, absolutely.” Yang Pengchan firmly replied. “He’s hailed as a miracle-working doctor, and he is definitely a master at his expertise. Let’s not question anything about him first, Lili. Just take Auntie and try the medicine first. We can still see Divine Doctor Tang if it’s not good and let him find another way.”</p><p>“Alright!” Yue Li complied and cautiously propped up her mother.</p><p>After Tang Xiu and Ouyang Lulu left the European-styled pavilion, Ouyang Lulu then asked with curiosity evident on her face, “Hey, Tang Xiu. Is that drop of medicinal liquid able to cure a leukemia patient? Isn’t that pretty much ridiculous?”</p><p>“I concocted that medicine myself. If it can’t cure the illness of ordinary people, then it’s just trash, completely useless,” said Tang Xiu smilingly. “Alright, don’t worry! That drop of Body Refining Liquid won’t just have an effect on her, but it will also fully clear out all the harmful white cells in her system, as well as gives great benefits to her physique. She’ll definitely live and stay healthy for the rest of her life, unless she gets into an accident and dies that way.”</p><p>Though half-believing and half-doubting it, Ouyang Lulu still nodded and no longer thought about it. She instead asked with a smile, “Have you had breakfast this morning? You want me to prepare you a meal?”</p><p>“That reminds me. I haven’t had a bite at all, frankly,” said Tang Xiu smilingly.</p><p>Quickly after, the couple appeared in the dining hall. There were some guests staying in the establishment, so the dining hall was quite full of people. But seeing Mo Yin having a meal in the corner of the dining hall was quite a surprise to Tang Xiu.</p><p>“Hello, Mr. Mo,” greeted Tang Xiu after walking over and sitting across from Mo Yi.</p><p>Mo Yi looked up and joyfully replied after he found out that it was Tang Xiu, “Hey, when did you come back and why didn’t you tell me in advance? There’s something very important that I need to tell you about!”</p><p>Tang Xiu’s interest piqued and he asked, “Is it about the result of the research?”</p><p>Mo Yi firmly nodded and said to the point, “Yeah. It was thanks to the help from Divine Doctor Gui Jianchou, so the research products have taken shape. We also have conducted some tests, though we haven’t yet experimented it on the human body. But all in all, all the tests are very satisfactory. Just two days ago, we sent some samples to the Shanghai First Public Hospital to be used on patients.”</p><p>“It can also be used to treat illness?” asked Tang Xiu in astonishment.</p><p>“Of course!” Mo Yi affirmed with a smile, “It can treat many illnesses. Also, we actually have a plan to do some experiments to use it on healthy people. But then, we were afraid that it would have side effects, so we canceled it. We’ll wait and observe more and, if there are no side effects on the patients, we’ll experiment on healthy average people.”</p><p>Tang Xiu went silent, but then suddenly said, “Send someone to retrieve the samples back from Shanghai First Public Hospital immediately. I’ll provide you some people for the experiment.”</p><p>“But about the side effects…” said Mo Yi quickly.</p><p>Tang Xiu raised his hand to interrupt him and said, “Don’t worry about that! I’ll be there as well, so even if the samples have any side effects, I have a way to remove it for them. And, Professor Mo, I wish that you won’t announce the results of your research for some time.”</p><p>“But why?” Mo Yi looked confused and asked, “It’s a good thing and it will benefit all mankind!”</p><p>“The result of your research will definitely cause a stir worldwide once it spread out ahead of time,” said Tang Xiu. “At that time, countless bloodshot and greedy eyes will fall on this Paradise Manor and you. Hence, we must keep it confidential as it is still in the early stage; at the same time, it will also ensure your safety.”</p><p>Mo Yi ruminated for a while and he felt that Tang Xiu was right, so he nodded and said, “Alright. I’ll listen to you! If anything, we won’t need to worry about the following steps of this research later. I’m also preparing to go back to Star City a few days from now. I spent quite some time to review the research over there and have some grasp of it, so I must go there and help with the research.”</p><p>“That’s fine. You can go back if you need to,” said Tang Xiu.</p><p>Shortly after, he asked Ouyang Lulu to call the experts from the Everlasting Feast Hall stationed here. After telling them to carry out some tasks, only then did he begin to eat the meal Ouyang Lulu gave him. Just as Mo Yi put down his chopsticks and was about to leave, however, Spectre waltzed in from the outside.</p><p>“Hello, Boss!”</p><p>The lackadaisical manner of Spectre vanished instantly upon seeing Tang Xiu, and he called out in high spirits.</p><p>Tang Xiu nodded at him in response and asked, “So, how has your progress in immortal cultivation been recently? Are you familiar with the Everlasting Feast Hall’s HQ in Jingmen Island now?”</p><p>Spectre forced a smile in response and shook his head, “Well, I’m just started to get used to it, though I was forced to experience one day as if it was the length of a year! But then, my mental power kind of magnified and my cultivation has reached the early stage of Foundation Establishment.”</p><p>Looking satisfied, Tang Xiu nodded and said, “I have been long aware that you can break through to the early stage of Foundation Establishment. After all, you already had a very solid foundation previously. But I don’t get it when you mentioned that you went through a day that was equal to a year in cultivation? What kind of issues did you have in the process, exactly?”</p><p>“It was not just mere issues, Boss.” Spectre sighed, “It was big problems! And Boss, your disciple is truly way too powerful. The array she arranged can actually…”</p><p>Tang Xiu raised his hand to interrupt him and calmly said, “I already know she’s very strong and has made grand accomplishment in arrays as well, so you don’t need to mention more. But since you already came to Shanghai, you’re going to follow me. Awu and the rest are now in Ning City dealing with something, so you’ll be my driver and bodyguard later.”</p><p>“Got it.”</p><p>Spectre immediately complied.</p><p>Tang Xiu then shifted his attention to Mo Yi and said, “You can go back first, Professor Mo. I gotta fill my belly first as I haven’t eaten for a couple of days. I’m starving right now.”</p><p>“Alright. I’ll take my leave first.”</p><p>Mo Yi, however, shot a deep glance at Spectre. He overheard the word “cultivation” from Tang Xiu and Spectre’s dialog. He didn’t understand what this “cultivation” word meant previously, but now he was well aware that this term Tang Xiu used meant he was cultivating in Dao to become the likes of celestial immortal in the legends.</p><p>“Mr. Tang.”</p><p>Just as Mo Yi left the dining hall, Wang Wei hurriedly ran in from the outside. After he came to Tang Xiu’s side, he respectfully handed over a bank card and said, “Mr. Tang, we were in the wrong previously, driven by our reckless youth mentality. Please don’t stoop to our stupidity and ignorance. If anything, this bank card has 240 million in it, a token of my apology for offending you. Please don’t think of it as too small a number as this is all the money I have.”</p><p>“Ehh?” Tang Xiu frowned and asked, “Who wants your money?”</p><p>Wang Wei subconsciously stole a glance at Spectre and replied, “I know you like money, Mr. Tang, so the money in this bank card is my token of apology to you. I promise I’ll never make the same mistake again in the future, nor will I rely on my family and wealth to act bossy and arrogant.”</p><p>Tang Xiu could tell Wang Wei’s purpose in giving him money from this guy’s mannerisms and expression. He was sure that Spectre had something to do with it. But then, it was stupid to refuse the money that was offered right before your eyes, so he took the bank card and tossed it to Ouyang Lulu. “You take this! Just talk directly to the construction developer which part of Paradise Villa you need to build. Tell them to do their job well and money is not a concern.”</p><p>As for Ouyang Lulu, she of course received the bank card happily. “Well, 240 million is quite a lot, but it’s still much less than the number we need for the whole project, though.”</p><p>Then, Spectre interjected, “Well, another guy is going to send another 240 million too.”</p><p>After Tang Xiu sent Wang Wei out, he then looked at Spectre and asked, “Why did you do that? Aren’t you some billionaire who’s not short on money?”</p><p>“I’m not short on cash indeed, but it feels so wrong to refuse a fortune that walks itself right to your door, no?” Spectre lightly grinned and said, “Besides, I don’t want the money from them. It’s your call how to deal with it, Boss.”</p><p>Tang Xiu let out a faint smile as he took out a jade bottle and flicked it to Spectre, smilingly saying, “The stuff inside will give you great benefits. Since your state of mind has been improved, it’s best to seize the chance to progress yourself further.”</p><p>Not long after, Yang Yang also came and gave a bank card. This time, he didn’t look at Ouyang Lulu even once, but instead stole glances at Spectre a few times instead.</p><p>“You really want to give this to me?” asked Tang Xiu as he looked at him smilingly.</p><p>“Boss Tang, we were indeed just like frogs looking at the sky from the bottom of a well previously.” Yang Yang bitterly spoke, “I didn’t know that you were so powerful. And since Lulu… no, Ouyang Lulu is your woman, then I naturally don’t dare to harbor any thoughts about her anymore. Please take this money. I hope that you can be magnanimous and won’t make things difficult for me in the future.”</p><p>“You know, people are usually unable to be convinced until they are faced with grim reality, so they end up losing much more than they should have in the end.” Tang Xiu smiled and said, “Your name is Yang Yang, isn’t it? I advise you to not practice martial arts to only act foolishly. Learn well of how to conduct yourself in the world, and cast away that nature of displaying a pretentious manner quickly. I’ve spared you today, but you won’t know what kind of figure you’re going to provoke in the future should you not change yourself. Cause later, maybe that person won’t be as good as I am.”</p><p>“Yes, yes. What you said is correct. I’ll certainly correct myself,” replied Yang Yan hurriedly.</p><p>Tang Xiu didn’t want to prolong the talk with him anymore. After tossing the bank card to Ouyang Lulu, he said, “Alright, you can go now and we’ll drop everything here and now! But I hope you can keep your mouth shut about some things you just found out; otherwise, your fate will end up grim.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
