The house he rented was at the northern end of the village and was at a relatively remote location. Despite the fact that Uncle Jia shouted worriedly to call him back so many times, Tang Xiu didn’t look back, nor did he stop.</p><p>“What do you wanna do to them?”</p><p>Xue Yu didn’t have the slightest sympathy for these hunters whatsoever. She was even disgusted by those two men whose eyes voraciously looked at her with perverted thoughts. Nevertheless, she didn’t want to see Tang Xiu commit murder either, even if those people truly deserved it.</p><p>“The net of Heaven is so vast. It may be loose, but it never misses anything,” said Tang Xiu. “Since those hunters are wicked people, then let them taste how evil the consequences for what they’ve done are. I won’t kill them, yet I won’t let them off scot-free either. The folks of this village are but good, ordinary people, so I’m going to give them a chance to make a meritorious deed.”</p><p>“That would be for the best, then,” said Xue Yu with a chuckle.</p><p>As they came to a worn-out house, the faint smell of gunpowder wafted in the air and they could hear a hoarse cough come from the dilapidated house. Two men with ugly and sullen faces leaned against the door, drowsing, whereas a hunchbacked middle-aged man was seen in the corner of the courtyard, stuffing the carcasses of several rare animals into sacks, and then threw them into the temporary wooden shed.</p><p>“Hey, Second, I’m gonna kill the wild boar I hunted yesterday. We’re gonna have wild pork stew tonight.” The hunchbacked man went into the front door and kicked the drowsy big man on the left side.</p><p>“Got it,” replied the big man on the left as he raised his head and looked up. Then he closed his eyes again.</p><p>“Boss!”</p><p>“Several Brothers!”</p><p>The baldy and the Fifth strode fast into the house and shouted loudly.</p><p>The hunchbacked middle-aged man turned his head and found them coming empty-handed. He immediately yelled angrily, “What the fuck are you ghost howling for? Didn’t I tell you to buy me some liquor?”</p><p>The Fifth hurriedly said, “We didn’t have time to buy the wine, Big Brother. But we saw a truly beautiful woman here. She’s really hot, so much hotter than the female stars we’ve seen on TV. I dare swear to heaven that you won’t be able to blink when you see her.”</p><p>The baldy also nodded and said, “The Fifth Brother said the truth and I dare to prove it. That woman… damn… be it her body, her looks, or her making, she’s definitely top of the top. You won’t find anyone like her among ten thousand others. Big Brother, I’ve seen many women, but never once have I ever seen one as beautiful as her.”</p><p>Surprise flashed in the eyes of the hunchbacked middle-aged man. He may not bother to spare any attention had it been only one of them testifying about it. But since both of his brothers said so, that woman must definitely be a top product!</p><p>‘How the hell does that have a thing to do with me?’</p><p>A cold light flashed in the hunchbacked middle-aged man’s eyes and he shouted in a grim voice, “We brothers are gathering here for money, you fucking hear that? If you wanna fuck women, go deal with your work and earn your money. But now, you gotta do your fucking job properly. Don’t make new problems crop up and cause issues later.”</p><p>“But, Big Brother, we…” stalled the baldy.</p><p>The Fifth raised his hand to interrupt him and quickly said, “We don’t want to make more troubles, Big Brother! It’s just that woman is like a celestial maiden. Just wait and see her for yourself. Your eyes will definitely be full of greed when you see her. Also, she’s with a 20-something-year-old young man. He’s extremely arrogant and even threatened us.”</p><p>BANG…</p><p>The house’s front door was kicked open and Tang Xiu pulled Xue Yu inside. He quickly glanced around and then sneered, “Yup, I’m really arrogant and I threatened you too. So what? You wanna seek revenge?”</p><p>The Fifth was dumbstruck; he never dreamed that this young man would dare to track him. Was this brat’s brain broken or something? Wasn’t he aware that he was like a sheep entering the tiger’s mouth?</p><p>The hunchbacked middle-aged man vigilantly observed Tang Xiu. But when his eyes fell on Xue Yu, he looked shocked all of a sudden. It took him a few seconds to wake up from his stunned state as he coldly hummed and said, “Who are you, Mister? You dare kick the door, huh? You truly have some big balls!”</p><p>“You’re not qualified to know who I am,” said Tang Xiu apathetically. “Neither have you got the ability to judge how big my courage is. Now, you’re either going to submit and will hold your head on the wall, or I’ll trash you all up until you faint!”</p><p>The two sleepy big men next to the door got up at the same time. The man on left, whose body was very robust, cracked his neck. He made the crackling sounds with his clenched fist to bring out an intimidating sound, then glared at Tang Xiu with obvious killing intent, “Punk, your grandfather will kill you today and I’ll have your woman…”</p><p>Slap…</p><p>Tang Xiu’s body flashed and appeared in front of him. With the sound of a loud slap in the face, the stalwart man was as though turning into a kite that snapped from the line, flying upside down through the house’s door and falling heavily on the cold ground outside.</p><p>“An expert?”</p><p>The hunchbacked middle-aged man’s pupils shrunk and his killing intent appeared indistinctly. He knew the strength of his Second Brother; not even a very skilled martial artist would necessarily be able to fight him. He himself was just a half step away from reaching the level of martial arts grandmaster, yet he couldn’t catch how this young man moved and acted.</p><p>“You’re very strong.” He quickly took out a pistol from his waist and quickly pulled the safety lock as he pointed its muzzle to Tang Xiu, “But I wanna know who’s faster. You, or my bullet!”</p><p>The other stocky men also quickly rushed into the house. In just but a few seconds, they quickly grabbed firearms and air rifles and aimed at Tang Xiu one after another.</p><p>Tang Xiu, however, turned his head to look at Xue Yu and asked with a faint smile, “Are you afraid?”</p><p>Xue Yu showed no fear at all. There even was some pity in her eyes. She shook her head and smilingly said, “Those who are ignorant truly have nothing to fear. Instead of fear, I just feel pity for them. Do you sense it too? Their killing aura is so thick. Their hands should be stained with the blood and lives of more than two people.”</p><p>“Yeah, especially this humpbacked man.” Tang Xiu nodded and said, “He has at least killed 10 lives and should have tortured his victims. Yet I’m rather surprised how come they still live to the present.”</p><p>“Please be a bit gentle to them,” said Xue Yu.</p><p>Tang Xiu let out a faint smile and looked at the grim and angry bunch of these mobs. Then his eyes fell on the hunchbacked middle-aged man, whose face was full of vigilance, and smilingly said, “My words are accurate, aren’t they?”</p><p>The hunchbacked middle-aged man’s heart kept sinking. Although he and his brothers pointed their guns at Tang Xiu, he felt that this young man was too bizarre. He hesitated for a short while and asked again in a grim voice, “Who exactly are you, Mister?”</p><p>Tang Xiu waved and said, “You naturally can look at my ID card and know who I really am if you can kill me, but otherwise it is unnecessary for you to know who I am if you can’t do so. That’s right, didn’t you ask me which is faster between me and your bullet? Go try it. I’ll stand here and won’t move.”</p><p>“You court your death!”</p><p>The big man who had just been slapped and sent flying by Tang Xiu hideously grinned. He aimed the cold muzzle of his gun at Tang Xiu’s head and didn’t hesitate in pulling the trigger.</p><p>Bang…</p><p>After the gunshot, however, the evil grin on his face froze.</p><p>“How can this be?”</p><p>“Holy shit! Is he a man or a revenant?!”</p><p>“He caught the bullet empty-handed? Motherfucker! Am I going crazy or has this world gone nuts?!”</p><p>“Shit… he’s too frightening.”</p><p>“…”</p><p>The hunchbacked middle-aged man’s wrist shivered a few times and his finger that was ready on the trigger was pulled back in an instant. With a look of horror on his face, he paced back two steps and anxiously said, “L-Little Brother, w-we’re at fault before; we admit it. I-I’m Western Humpback and all the friends on the road know me. We don’t have any enmity whatsoever, so this is just a small misunderstanding caused by mistiming remarks. How about we drop everything that happened here today and we’ll leave this place at once?”</p><p>Tang Xiu pinched the bullet and asked with a faint smile, “If I hadn’t caught the bullet just now, do you think you can easily ask to drop everything, huh?”</p><p>The hunchbacked middle-aged man fell into silence for a while, and then slowly asked, “Then… how do you want it settled, Mister?”</p><p>Tang Xiu threw away the pinched bulled and gently opened his hands as he smilingly said, “No worries! Although I’ve killed many people, I don’t want to commit a massacre today. You’re gonna die for sure, but what should kill you must be the bullets from the cops.”</p><p>In a flash, two streaks of Primal Chaos Force shot out from Tang Xiu’s hands. It acted like invisible ropes that instantly tied down all the guns in the hands of the seven men and took them away instantly, while Tang Xiu’s figure was flashing lightning fast and constantly appeared in front of the seven men. His fist sent punches to their bodies, causing them to fly upside down and backward.</p><p>Cough, cough…</p><p>Aaargh…</p><p>Amid the shrill scream of pains, the seven men heavily fell to the ground one after another.</p><p>Tang Xiu walked over to the hunchbacked middle-aged man with both hands crossed behind his back. He then stepped on his head and said, “Old Western Humpback, huh? You’re so fucking funny. Just with your strength, you’re very famous with all the brigands on the road? Is the Western region full of nobodies like you?”</p><p>The hunchbacked middle-aged man could only lay on the ground honestly, letting Tang Xiu step on his head without even an ounce of courage to struggle. He had met fierce people in the past and he even offended a martial arts grandmaster before, yet he still managed to escape eventually. Where had he been trampled on like this?</p><p>‘A monster! This young man is definitely a monster, or else, how can a normal person possess such a frightening power?’</p><p>Tang Xiu shook his head and kicked his head until he got dizzy. Then he kicked him again several times before he finally came to the side of the big man who was called the Fifth. He squatted down and patted his cheek, smilingly speaking, “Don’t pretend to be dead, will you? I may just hit them hard, but I could have some reservations about you.”</p><p>“P-please spare me… don’t kill me.”</p><p>The Fifth struggled to sit up from the ground, begging for mercy with a face full of fear.</p><p>“If you can answer my questions, you have my word that I’ll never kill you,” said Tang Xiu with a smile. ” I won’t even make you crippled.”</p><p>“Please do ask,” said the Fifth with eager eyes.</p><p>“I wanna know what you’ve whispered to that baldy back when you both in the village, and why did you both give up buying wine and run back directly?” asked Tang Xiu. “Don’t lie to me, else this bullet will burst and strike your head!”</p><p>The blood on the Fifth’s face instantly receded and his face turned ghastly pale. Then he stutteringly answered, “Yes… that… that was… I-I said to look… for our brothers… to find… the way… to kill you… and then… we, brothers… will enjoy… your woman… together…”</p><p>SMACK…</p><p>Tang Xiu stunned him with a punch and then stepped on his legs. He then took out his mobile phone and dialed the 110 emergency number to call the police.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
