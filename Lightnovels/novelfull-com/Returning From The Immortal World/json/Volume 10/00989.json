It turns out that he’s going to assist Singluen in defeating Singkuo, huh?” sneered Kanaja coldly. “It seems there will be a good show coming up soon in Bangkok. I don’t want to be involved in this shit, but it’d be great if I could get some profit out of it.”</p><p>Songzan’s expression slightly shifted and he asked respectfully, “What exactly are you planning to do, Godfather?”</p><p>“Spread out these photos to our underlings and tell them to keep their eyes on every part of Bangkok closely,” said Kanaja. “Report to me at once when you find Tang Xiu and Singluen’s traces. I can expect to get a surprise if I can take advantage of this situation.”</p><p>As much as he knew of Kanaja, Songzan was well aware of how resourceful and shrewd this dreadful man was. This guy would stop at nothing once he sniffed out a profit he could get from any situation.</p><p>However, he had no idea which side Kanaja would give his help to and gain favors from—Singkuo or, Tang Xiu and Singluen.</p><p>“What about me, Godfather? Shall I head to the club for the time being?” asked Songzan. He felt rather puzzled, yet intrigued at the same time. He also wanted to get involved in this matter, hoping to get benefits. Yet, he was afraid that the matter would be too big and he would just trap himself in a mess instead of getting any benefits.</p><p>“Help me deal with this matter first,” said Kanaja. “Once you find that Tang Xiu and Singluen are in Bangkok, contact me at once. Also, tell the boys to avoid any conflict with them. If they find you first, tell them that all of you are Kanaja’s men and are under my orders.”</p><p>“Understood!” replied Songzan as he turned and left.</p><p>****</p><p>Don Mueang District, Feather Palace Club.</p><p>As Tang Xiu, Singluen, and the rest arrived, the club’s manager took them to the innermost area of the club. To Tang Xiu’s surprise, the Feather Palace Club turned out to be a clubhouse with various business establishments, the most popular ones being horsemanship and shooting, painting, a casino, and boxing halls.</p><p>“Mr. Tang, this manager knows me, but your men told us to come here. Wouldn’t it be too easy to expose our whereabouts?” asked Singluen in a whisper as he walked beside Tang Xiu.</p><p>The question made Tang Xiu slightly frown, and he thought for a moment before replying, “Jin Shi has always been cautious in dealing with things. I also have already told him to be discreet and keep our tracks in the dark. So I think this manager should be reliable.”</p><p>“This manager may be reliable, but the rest of the people in this club are not necessarily trustworthy,” replied Singluen in a whisper. “As I recall, many people working for Kanaja often come here in their spare time. I had a clash with his underlings here once, and even though I didn’t lose much, I wasn’t able to get the upper hand either.”</p><p>Tang Xiu observed the surroundings and then said in a whisper, “I don’t think anyone has discovered us. Just take a look around the route we took. Haven’t you noticed it? The path is not the main one to the interior. This place is also surrounded by trees and is quite covert. Those who we’ve seen here are not ordinary patrons who have come here for recreation. They’re obviously the security guards of this club.”</p><p>Singluen hadn’t noticed what Tang Xiu just pointed out. He suddenly realized the situation after Tang Xiu’s reminder, finally appeasing his restlessness.</p><p>Deep in the club was an office inside a Western-style building. Surrounding it was a garden encaged in high walls that gave off a peculiar sense of grandeur. Outside the courtyard was a five-meter wide small river with a concrete road that led to a seven-plus meter wide courtyard gate. There, four cold and grim-looking middle-aged men in black uniforms and armed with submachine guns were standing guard.</p><p>“Boss.”</p><p>Jin Shi, Mo Awu and their teams had been waiting outside the courtyard and immediately paced forward to greet Tang Xiu’s group respectfully.</p><p>The scene instantly made the faces of the four men standing guard on both sides of the courtyard gate change to a look of shock, including the middle-aged manager now wearing a look of incredulity.</p><p>“You know the purpose of our trip and how we must keep it the dark, don’t you?” questioned Tang Xiu lightly. “This Feather Palace Club has got all kinds of people, so is it really suitable for us to stay here?”</p><p>“The Feather Palace Club is run by our headquarters, Boss,” said Jin Shi respectfully. “It was established when I was in Bangkok to carry out my missions here. I rarely manage this club, so I gave it to Taylor to manage. He’s a reliable and trustworthy guy. I’ve trained these four men since long ago and their loyalty to me is unquestionable.”</p><p>Tang Xiu nodded in response and he glanced at Taylor, the manager, as well as the four men. Then, he said, “We’ll stop over and stay here since they are trustworthy! Alright, let’s have some rest first. We’ll move later tonight.”</p><p>“Mr. Tang, you said we’re going to move tonight…” asked Singluen hurriedly.</p><p>“We’re going to see the Head branch of the Darkwind organization in Bangkok.” Tang Xiu raised his hand to interrupt him and lightly said, “We need some information, so we’ll buy it from him. Our operation will be carried out after that.”</p><p>“Alright. We’ll follow your order.” Singluen nodded.</p><p>The interior decoration of the three-story Western-style building was extraordinarily luxurious. There were four housekeepers managing the building, one man and three women. Jin Shi also explained that only a select few people could come to the building, all of whom were their own.</p><p>It was Tang Xiu’s plan to help Singluen take over the Patriarch seat of the Dark Shaman clan. The very reason was to obtain Demon Stone, so he immediately called him over after coming here.</p><p>Inside the study, Tang An, wearing a black robe and a bronze mask, appeared in front of the crowd and personally served tea before coming out and standing guard silently.</p><p>Tang Xiu drank a cup of tea and then initiated conversation, “Singluen, I need to know the specific details of your Dark Shaman Clan, such as the forces under your clan and the armed forces under the control of your big brother. This information is very crucial since victory can only be in our grasp if you know what we have and the situation of our enemy.”</p><p>“I reckon the Darkwind organization has penetrated my clan deeply,” said Singluen. “A member of this organization was found in an incident a few years ago, so it was necessary to buy intel from them about it. As for my brother, I have sent my men to carry out investigations on him many times, and I believe that he controls a lot more forces compared to what I’ve previously investigated.”</p><p>His answer made Tang Xiu ponder for a while. Then, he nodded and said, “Since we need to find out about how many forces our opponent has, then our first move is to buy the intel from the Darkwind organization and compare them with yours. Also, the only suggestion I have is to remove Singkuo and his loyal men. But it’s best to keep alive all the forces under the Dark Shaman clan as much as possible. After all, these forces will be yours to manage once you take over the Patriarch seat of your clan.”</p><p>“You’re right. The number one enemy is my big brother and his loyal dogs,” said Singluen. “Yet still, I think we must guard against my father now.”</p><p>“I know that. Your old man is leaning toward your big brother, and thus you must carry out the worst plan,” sighed Tang Xiu. “I’ll still help you kill your big brother, but there’s one thing I must know. Once we kill him, what will you do if your old man puts this account on my head?”</p><p>Singluen’s eyes overflowed with dull light. He never had considered this issue before. But after Tang Xiu mentioned it to him, he instantly realized that, given his father’s character, such a possibility was indeed very likely to occur. At that time, his father probably would not kill him, but he’d definitely go after Tang Xiu.</p><p>Furthermore, Tang Xiu himself was not a saint, and it was impossible for him to just sit still when his father was trying to kill him. When that time came, the death of his father by Tang Xiu’s hands was inevitable.</p><p>As he came to this conclusion, Singluen then immediately said, “Mr. Tang, if my father really goes against you due to hatred at that time, could… you please spare him? If… if you can’t, then just abolish his cultivation. I’m sure I’ll be able to have him under control and won’t bother you anymore in the future as long as he’s crippled.”</p><p>“It seems like this is the only option we have.” Tang Xiu nodded.</p><p>****</p><p>It was late at night.</p><p>A few hazy figures arrived silently at the Bangkok branch of the Darkwind organization. Their movements were so discreet that nobody was able to notice them even when they appeared outside of the Branch Supervisor’s bedroom.</p><p>Knock, knock…</p><p>The knock on the room’s door awakened Charlie from his sleep. The man instantly grabbed his pistol under the pillow and swiftly unlocked its safety lock. Charlie was always a very cautious and alert man despite being ordinarily timid. It was because of his overcautious and meticulous nature that he was able to climb up to his current position as the Branch Supervisor in Bangkok for the Darkwind organization.</p><p>Therefore, all of his subordinates were well aware of his habits. None of them would knock on his bedroom door late at night unless there was a huge issue to deal with. Even if something big happened, they would call him and ask to meet him on the phone first.</p><p>“Who is it?”</p><p>With a gun pointed at the door, Charlie asked with palpable murderous intent. His voice was so loud that the Darkwind organization’s martial arts experts who were responsible for the security and protection around him realized that an intruder had infiltrated this place, causing them to rush over to his room.</p><p>Tang Xiu, Singluen, Mo Awu, and Tang Guang stood outside the room, surrounded by strong men training guns at them. Tang Xiu let out a smile and then said, “Well, I took the liberty for this night visit, Mr. Charlie. I hope you’re not angry. But there’s nothing to worry about, as I want to strike a big deal with your Darkwind agency.”</p><p>“Who are you?” asked Charlie away behind the door.</p><p>Tang Xiu’s group of four were all wearing bronze masks in order to not reveal their identity. Upon hearing Charlie’s question, Tang Xiu lightly smiled and said, “It’s rather inconvenient to expose our identity, Mr. Charlie, let alone that there’s no need for you to know who we are. I just told you that I want to strike a big deal and buy information from you, didn’t I? You just need to give us the intel I need and I’ll pay you enough for it.”</p><p>Charlie was silent for a while and then shouted “Hey, Yale! Are you here?”</p><p>One of the big guys that surrounded Tang Xiu’s group replied in a deep voice, “We got them under control, Sir Charlie. Don’t worry!”</p><p>Only then did Charlie feel relieved. Yet after he came to the door, he still carefully opened it with his gun first to peep outside, only feeling fully relaxed after seeing the scene outside.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
