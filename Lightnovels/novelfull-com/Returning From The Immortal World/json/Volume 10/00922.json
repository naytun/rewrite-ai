He quietly thought for a while and then said, “If I let you help me investigate the Lian Family, can you investigate them thoroughly? Also, how long would it take?”</p><p>Song Donglai and Ao Wei exchanged glances as they faintly felt that Tang Xiu seemed to have the intention to get rid of the Lian Family. The thoughts made the duo look pleasantly surprised immediately, and Song Donglai was the first to reply, “We can compile all the information about the Lian Family for you within three days.”</p><p>Ao Wei also nodded and said, “Yes, three days are enough. We three brothers have been guarding against the Lians the past few years—hence, we’ve been collecting massive amounts of information about them in secret. It’s just that we have yet to figure out and calculate how many forces they are hiding in the dark; that includes their ancestors, whom we haven’t figured out yet how many of them are still alive.”</p><p>Tang Xiu thought for a moment and said, “If so, then I’ll give you three days. I want detailed information about the Lian Family within three days. Keep in mind that the more detailed the information you give me, the more thorough the members of this family will be eradicated. You’re all enemies with them, and I don’t think you also want to have worries left behind, right?”</p><p>“Consider it done,” replied Song Donglai with a deep voice.</p><p>Tang Xiu nodded and prepared to leave, but he suddenly remembered something and said, “There’s one more thing. I need you to play my script. I need Boss Huang to trust Li Qiang completely—he even must regard Li Qiang as his benefactor and trusted confidant.”</p><p>“Please tell us, how would you like us to help?” asked Song Donglai with a strange expression.</p><p>“I’m going to scare him, and you’ll follow the act according to the circumstances,” said Tang Xiu smilingly.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Although Song Donglai wanted to seize the time to use the Blood Python Array to have a breakthrough in his cultivation, he still complied to Tang Xiu’s request.</p><p>Tang Xiu then turned around. He looked at the direction where Li Qiang and Boss Huang were hiding and shouted, “Hey, you, Meatball Huang! Drill out of your hole at once if you’re still alive—otherwise, I’ll shred you to pieces!”</p><p>In a certain spot in the distance.</p><p>Boss Huang was trembling violently. Never did he expect that Tang Xiu would harbor such a grudge and be vengeful. He even knew that he was hiding in this spot. He instantly grabbed Li Qiang’s hand and pleaded, “Brother Qiang, please ask your cousin to save me. You all will be my greatest benefactor for the rest of my life as long as you can save me.”</p><p>Li Qiang couldn’t help but laugh inwardly, yet he still maintained his facial expression and said, “I’ll naturally save you since you see me as a brother, Boss. I always subscribe to the notion that brothers must help each other in braving dangers, even at the cost of their lives. But… are we really going to go out?”</p><p>“What if we don’t go out now, you say?” blurted Boss Huang bitterly. “If we don’t go out on our own initiative, I’m afraid we won’t have any chance of living once they find us.”</p><p>After saying that, he slowly headed out of the corner. When he appeared in Tang Xiu’s line of sight, he ran over with a deep fear on his face, bowing unctuously and speaking with an obsequious smile and manner, “B-brother… Brother Tang, I’m Huang Bingren, whom you have packed up into submission. Uh, well… I didn’t know who you were before, so I spoke discourteously in front of you. Please forgive my ignorance with your magnanimous heart.”</p><p>Tang Xiu was secretly laughing inside, yet he maintained his frosty face on the surface and coldly said, “So, you got a chill after you figured out who I am, huh? You dragged those gangsters of yours and tracked me here for revenge against me, didn’t you?”</p><p>Boss Huang was short on breath and he gasped as he replied, “No, no, no. I really didn’t have any thoughts to retaliate, absolutely! We’re here to help Boss Song deal with his enemies, no less. Isn’t that right, Boss Song?”</p><p>Upon hearing his remarks, Li Qiang quickly caught the role, “Cousin, you gotta say some good words about my Boss! We really came here to help you, after all.”</p><p>Song Donglai looked hesitant. He let out a dry smile and said, “Mr. Tang, about this… they did come to help me. It’s just that I didn’t expect the Lian Family to come with so many powerful enemies and eventually kill all of Boss Huang’s men except that scar-faced man.”</p><p>Tang Xiu’s facial expression eased a lot, but he still sternly replied, “Those who have offended me deserve their deaths. Even if you don’t come knocking to find me for revenge, I’ll still have to kill you since I bumped into you now. But you can rest your worries; I’m sure that there’s someone who’ll burn paper money for your departure day next year.”</p><p>BAM…</p><p>Boss Huang’s expression was grim as he instantly knelt on the ground, anxiously begging, “Brother Tang… Ancestor Tang… please forgive and spare me! I have an 80-year-old mother… And… I also have an unmarried daughter. Please have mercy and spare my lowly life. I promise I’ll absolutely treat you as a bodhisattva in the future. I’ll brave through fire and storm no matter what you request of me.”</p><p>“You still deserve your death!” Tang Xiu raised his longsword and put on a pose to chop down.</p><p>Li Qiang instantly rushed to the front of Boss Huang to stop him and hurriedly pleaded, “Your Honor, Mr. Tang, please have mercy and forgive my Boss! He’s really a good person; he was just blinded because he wanted to save face. He didn’t know your identity before, so he had offended you without him realizing. P-please… please have a look at my cousin’s face and forgive him this time—otherwise, you can kill us both here.”</p><p>Song Donglai’s expression enormously altered as he dashed to Li Qiang’s front and slapped his face, yelling angrily, “What the fucking hell are you talking about?”</p><p>After saying that, he turned to look at Tang Xiu, letting out an obsequious smile and saying, “Mr. Tang, this younger cousin of mine is still too young and ignorant, please ignore and forgive him. Also… about this… could you please spare and not punish them severely on the account of my face?”</p><p>Tang Xiu sneered, “I should give you face properly speaking, but…”</p><p>“Mr. Tang, Young Qiang is my closest cousin. My aunt will definitely be very grieved if he’s gone,” said Song Donglai with a resolute voice, “10 million. I’ll take out 10 million to save his life.”</p><p>“Me… me too,” interjected Boss Huang rapidly. “I… I… I’ll also take out 10 million for my life.”</p><p>Tang Xiu squinted and coldly snorted, “Hmph. Do you think I give a damn about a meager 20 million? Snort… not to mention 20 million, I won’t even spare a glance at 200 million. However, you truly have a good cousin here. He’s worth befriending given his attitude to save his Boss even at the cost of his life. Alright, I’ll drop this matter on the account of his face.”</p><p>Boss Huang was so glad that a look of ecstasy appeared on his face. He kowtowed to Tang Xiu thrice and thanked him, “Thank you, Mr. Tang. Thank you for not killing me. You’re my idol in my heart now. I’ll never have the slightest disrespect towards you again in the future.”</p><p>Tang Xiu rolled his eyes at his vow and lightly said, “I won’t kill you, but you cannot escape from your capital crime. You’ve brought many people to their deaths here this time, so you will compensate their families as their pension, 10 million yuan each! Keep in mind, do well to get along together with this little brother of yours—or, I won’t mind castrating your manhood, before butchering you and feeding you to the dogs.”</p><p>“Yes, yes, yes!” Cold sweat drenched Boss Huan’s wet while he nodded his head repeatedly like a pecking chicken.</p><p>A short while later, Tang Xiu left the Green Lake Agricola. After the Mercedes-Benz SUV passed through the gate, he immediately told Mo Awu to book a plane ticket to Ning City in Haiqing Province.</p><p>As he sat in the back seat, Tang Xiu held the Nine Fetuses of a Hundred Ghosts Streamer and observed it. He then found that the streamer had more than 450 souls. Nearly half of them had been refined and turned into vengeful spirits with no consciousness left. He wouldn’t be able to help these vengeful spirits to recover. Not even a Perfected Golden Immortal would be able to do so unless he himself could become a Supremacy just like back when he was in the Immortal World.</p><p>There was also something else. The refinement of this Nine Fetuses of a Hundred Ghosts Streamer was very rough. Although there was a double layer of arrays inside it, they were just low-rank arrays and he was able to grasp them thoroughly after slightly studying it.</p><p>“Dust returns to dust—and unto the earth shall you return from the soil you have originated from. For all the sins of your past—and into reincarnation, you shall rebirth for your retribution and be born anew to do new things in your next life. It’s all the Six Path of the Wheel of Samsara and the cycle of karma. I was fated to encounter this matter today, and it’s inevitable that I can’t stand idly by. Go and enter your reincarnation earlier! I hope good fortune will be bestowed upon you all in your next life.”</p><p>Tang Xiu pinched his fingers and a wisp of dark Heaven and Earth energy condensed at his fingertips. In a flash moment, hundreds of souls swarmed towards the wisp of energy. Just before they were sucked inside by that energy, all the souls turned around and kowtowed to Tang Xiu.</p><p>“The rest of the vengeful spirits…”</p><p>Tang Xiu was contemplating for a while before he finally decided to let them back to the world where they belonged to. The origin of their karma had come to an end. There was no need for them to be trapped inside the Nine Fetuses of a Hundred Ghosts Streamer anymore—neither did they have to stay in this world as vengeful spirits in the human world and harm others. Just as he pulled out around 200 vengeful spirits inside the streamer, his body suddenly trembled while countless planets inside his Dantian sent out a very strong vibration. One of the most obvious was the planet the size of the table tennis ball. Not only did it send out a strong sucking force, but it also directly absorbed these vengeful spirits into Tang Xiu’s Dantian and completely swallow them.</p><p>Buzz…</p><p>Tang Xiu could clearly see that the planet, which was originally only the size of a table tennis ball, turn bigger, twice its previous size. The vibration lasted only a few seconds before everything returned to normal again.</p><p>“What exactly happened?”</p><p>Tang Xiu watched his hands turn completely dim. The Nine Fetuses of a Hundred Ghosts Streamer had become the source of all mundane things in this planet. He observed the planet inside his Dantian and only sobered up from his shock after a long while.</p><p>Xue Yu, who sat next to Tang Xiu, looked at him with a tongue-tied expression. After a short while, she couldn’t help but grab his hand and ask with a worried face, “Are you… are you alright?”</p><p>Tang Xiu turned his head. He could see the worried expression on her face and answered, “I’m fine.”</p><p>Xue Yu still didn’t feel at ease and said again, “I just saw countless black smoke seep into your body. I thought something from the Nine Seed of a Hundred Ghosts Streamer was harmful. I’m really relieved that you’re fine.”</p><p>“To tell the truth, I don’t really know what just happened to me either,” said Tang Xiu bitterly. “I just pulled out those vengeful spirits from the Nine Fetuses of a Hundred Ghosts Streamer, yet they suddenly penetrated my body. Even… I even feel that I’m stronger after devouring their resentment. Those vengeful spirits didn’t have consciousness, only resentment, yet it’s like… their resentment was a strong tonic, a miraculous elixir in the eyes of cultivators.”</p><p>“You devoured them?!!” Xue Yu was dumbstruck. She was frightened by Tang Xiu’s explanation.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
