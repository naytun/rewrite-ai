Ever since they both started their relationship, he hadn’t taken her on a date literally, so he smilingly said, “Alright, wait till after I’m done with this issue, and I’ll take some time to accompany you. How about it?”</p><p>“Great!” replied Ouyang Lulu with a pleasantly surprised face.</p><p>Tang Xiu then released his perception. When he found Spectre downstairs, he immediately spoke, “Lulu, I’ll be leaving as soon as possible, so could you help book plane tickets for me and Spectre?”</p><p>“A flight straight to Thailand?” asked Ouyang Lulu. “Which city do you want to go to?”</p><p>“We’ll head to Jingmen Island first as there are some things I need to tend to there,” said Tang Xiu. “We’ll leave for Thailand afterward.”</p><p>“What are you gonna do in Jingmen Island?” asked Ouyang Lulu with a puzzled expression.</p><p>“I encountered some things in Chang City a few days ago. Some friends were having troubles there, so I assigned them to leave for Jingmen Island,” answered Tang Xiu. “I’m going to see them there.”</p><p>Ouyang Lulu understood, but her face was now covered with worry. “I know that you’re an important man, Tang Xiu, and I know that you’re very strong. But you often go to dangerous places, so no matter what, please pay attention to your safety.”</p><p>“Don’t worry! I’ll do that.” Tang Xiu gently hugged her while smiling.</p><p>****</p><p>As dusk came, Tang Xiu and Spectre arrived at Jingmen Island. Once landed, he didn’t notice anyone from the Everlasting Feast Hall, so he just took a cab to go their HQ.</p><p>“Anyway, Boss. I truly don’t want to step foot here again for the rest of my life if I have a choice,” muttered Spectre while sighing and looking at the scenery through the window. There was a hint of fear on his face.</p><p>“Ehh?” A smile sketched on the corner of Tang Xiu’s lips. He then said with a thin smile, “Well, well. I never thought that there could be someplace in the world that even could make you so afraid, Spectre. But, having some dread is kinda a good thing, though.”</p><p>Spectre gave a long face and said, “Could you not make fun of me, Boss? How about I get off here and you go there by yourself. Just call me when you’re about to leave.”</p><p>“Ahaha…” Tang Xiu couldn’t help but laugh. “Damn. I am really amazed, though. What exactly happened to you to make you so afraid like this?”</p><p>Spectre touched the bridge of his nose and let out a dry smile, “I’m just… I was scared by… by your disciple, Boss. I sure as hell never want to get trapped inside that array again. You see, I was grounded to improve myself inside it for 13 years. It made me unsure whether I’m 32 or 45 years old.”</p><p>“Say what?” Tang Xiu blinked with gleaming eyes.</p><p>“What’s what? I said I’m afraid of your powerful disciple, Boss,” affirmed Spectre again.</p><p>“No, not that line.” Tang Xiu shook his head and continued, “About the 13 years, what exactly was it? Is it involving the Chrono Array?”</p><p>Spectre nodded. “Yeah, it’s the Chrono Array. Time is accelerated by a 1:365 scale inside it, meaning a day is equal to a whole year. You see, anyone might be able to live for a day, 10, or even 100 days inside alone. But I’d been through 13 years inside. That was 4745 days. Saying it is a miracle for me not to fall insane with such torment is an understatement.”</p><p>Tang Xiu suddenly remembered that Gu Yan’er had learned a very mysterious secret art from being a disciple of the Shade Demon, Zhu Wushou. Laying out such a time accelerating array might be impossible for others, but not Gu Yan’er. And what did he need the most at the present? It was time.</p><p>Quickly after, the taxi stopped at the parking lot of a manor. Gu Xiaoxue had received the news in advance and was already waiting there.</p><p>The moment Tang Xiu got out the car, he asked her in a deep voice, “Where’s Yan’er?”</p><p>“Master is inside the alchemy chamber,” answered Gu Xiaoxue. “Master said that she’s going to concoct some pills and give them to Miss Xue.”</p><p>Tang Xiu’s brows creased. He strode to the alchemy chamber at his top speed. As he got there, blazing heat greeted him as he found Gu Yan’er standing by the furnace, throwing some miraculous herbs into the furnace unceasingly. Standing beside her was Ji Chimei, silently reading a book about herbs.</p><p>“Lord…”</p><p>Ji Chimei saw him arrive and respectfully greeted.</p><p>Tang Xiu lifted his hand to stop her from speaking more. He saw that Gu Yan’er was in the critical point of the concoction process, so he didn’t want to disturb her.</p><p>After half an hour, the lid of the furnace flew up, followed by the rich scent of medicine. Gu Yan’er reached out to grab the pill floating in the air. The pill that was radiating gentle golden light appeared in her hand and she quickly conjured a secret art to seal it and stuff it inside the prepared long jade bottle.</p><p>“Why are you here, Master?”</p><p>Gu Yan’er looked pleasantly surprised and greeted Tang Xiu.</p><p>“I wanted to see the situation here, while there’s also something important I need to ask you,” answered Tang Xiu.</p><p>“Please ask, Master,” replied Gu Yan’er.</p><p>“Spectre told me that you threw him inside the Chrono Array, which reminded me that you once learned the mystery about secret arts relating to time with the disciple of the Shade Demon, Zhu Wushou, allowing you to arrange the Chrono Array,” said Tang Xiu. “One thing I wanna ask is: can one also cultivate inside?”</p><p>“Yeah! Why?” Gu Yan’er nodded.</p><p>The answer was much to Tang Xiu’s delight. “If so, then you’re going with me to Clam Island! Cultivating inside the Chrono Array will be a great boon for the growth of those children we’ve been cultivating there. I’m sure they can quickly grow up.”</p><p>“Ah, it turns out to be about that.” Gu Yan’er chuckled and said, “It’s not a problem for me as I can go right away, but…”</p><p>“But what?” asked Tang Xiu</p><p>“My Chrono Array only has the ability to temper one’s state of mind. It’s unable to help the growth of cultivation unless I can get the Chrono Crystal and True Psyche,” answered Gu Yan’er. “With these two kinds of peerless treasures, I can build a special dimension of the time-space array, so anyone can truly live and cultivate both body and mind inside.”</p><p>“The last Chrono Crystal was used up on you, so we have none of it now. “Tang Xiu frowned. “Additionally, the True Psyche can only be obtained by those Golden Immortal experts in the Immortal World who took the Heartseeker school and have gone through 49 Heavenly Tribulations. In addition, it’s also after they’re able to understand and elucidate true and false, essence and exterior—only then can they obtain this True Psyche. We could find a way to get it if we were in the Immortal World no matter how difficult it is. But this place is Earth, so there’s no way we can get it.”</p><p>“Well, then I can only lay out the illusion Chrono Array. The only use of it is to temper the mind. It will make their state of mind progress rapidly, even beyond their age limits.”</p><p>Tang Xiu thought about it and said, “It’s already great for it to be able to improve the state of mind. However, there’s no hurry to leave for Clam Island right away. You should cultivate well first. After you’re sure there’s no problem with your body anymore, you can go there and return back ASAP.”</p><p>“Alright. I’ll do that.”</p><p>Her reply was accompanied by a bright smiling face, as she could feel the concern in Tang Xiu’s words. It made her feel warm and happy inside.</p><p>“That’s right. I just recalled that I sent some people from Chang City. Where are they now?” asked Tang Xiu.</p><p>“You sent some people from Chang City?” asked Gu Yan’er with a puzzled expression. “I don’t know about that!”</p><p>“I was the one who settled them here, Grand Master.” Gu Xiaoxue hurriedly interjected, “I didn’t tell Master since it was just a trivial issue. They are now in the Everlasting Feast Hall. I’ll summon them immediately if you want to see them.”</p><p>Tang Xiu waved and said, “There’s no need. Just take me to them. I’ll see them and leave for Thailand afterward.”</p><p>Shortly after, Tang Xiu left with Gu Xiaoxue while Gu Yan’er took the concocted pills and left to find Xue Yu. Neither Tang Xiu nor Gu Yan’er took the initiative to mention anything about the concocted pills.</p><p>Inside the guest room of the restaurant.</p><p>Tang Xiu met Song Donglai and Ao Wei while observing their respectful manners. He waved to gesture them to take a seat and said, “I’ve culled the Lian Family and killed every one of them who has any combat force. The surviving members are only the weak, elderly, and young, so you don’t need to hide here anymore. You can leave after our talk.”</p><p>Song Donglai and Ao Wei exchanged glances. The duo, who had just taken a seat, actually got up again and cupped their fists to Tang Xiu, “We’d like to cultivate and follow you, Senior Tang.”</p><p>“That’s right. Please accept us, Mr. Tang.”</p><p>While being surprised, Tang Xiu observed them for quite a while before he shook his head and said, “You both are different from Han Sen. He’d have been a dead man had I not saved him before. But you both… you both still have families and friends. Any emotional relationship of the mundane life will continue to pester you, so you two are not suitable to follow and work for me.”</p><p>Disappointment appeared on their faces. But Song Donglai didn’t give up and seriously said, “Then please take us as your in-name disciples, Senior Tang. We would appear to look older than you, but those who have reached a much higher realm deserve to be called Masters in the cultivation path. Please don’t shut the door on us. We have a genuine and sincere desire to follow you.”</p><p>“I can’t. The path I’m taking is different from yours entirety.” Tang Xiu shook his head and said, “If I were to accept you as my in-name disciples, the karmic ties between us will be created and I don’t want to affect my own cultivation because of you. So, you both have no need to mention this issue again.”</p><p>Having said that, however, he suddenly looked hesitant for a moment as an idea then came to his mind, saying, “However, I was literally your guide who took you on the cultivation path, so I can provide you with some opportunities. I can give you some cultivation resources if you want to go further on your cultivation path. However, you have to buy them.”</p><p>“What cultivation resources are they, exactly?” asked Song Donglai hurriedly.</p><p>“Medicinal pills, for instance,” answered Tang Xiu.</p><p>With eyes staring wide, Song Donglai asked in shock, “You will concoct medicinal pills?”</p><p>“Yeah, I’m going to concoct some.” Tang Xiu nodded and said, “But refining pills is a very difficult process. The number I can refine each time is but a few; hence, the price is very expensive. If you need them, you must buy them for quite a fortune.”</p><p>“We’re willing to buy them.” Song Donglai hurriedly said, “But how much is the price exactly—and what kind of pills?”</p><p>“You can ask Xiaoxue about that!” said Tang Xiu with a smile. “She’s the present manager of the Everlasting Feast Hall and also my grand disciple. You can directly contact her whenever you need to buy any pills.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
