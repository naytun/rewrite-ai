He had never believed in any existence of a god in the world as he was an atheist. Yet, a scene that depicted a god-like existence which could only appear on TV was taking place before his eyes at this moment.</p><p>‘Am… Am I… having a dream? Is this an illusion?’</p><p>Shaking his head hard, Karst looked around. As he saw all of his men and the bikini girls wearing dumbstruck expressions with eyes trained on the handsome youth trodding the surface of the water towards them, he realized that neither was it a dream or illusion clouding his eyes.</p><p>“Are you Karst, the governor of Saipan?”</p><p>There was a smile on Tang Guang’s face, yet his eyes gave off a vibe of murderous intent somehow. Although he had received information that Karst took several of his men and brought a lot of ‘butterfly socialites’ on vacation at sea, he still had to spend quite a lot of energy and effort to find this man.</p><p>“Who are you?” asked Karst, vigilantly looking at Tang Guang.</p><p>“You don’t need to know who I am.” Tang Guang shook his head and smiled. “Just answer me. Are you Karst, the Governor of Saipan? Of course, you can refuse to answer, but for the price of your dead body becoming food for the fishes.”</p><p>Karst moved his hands to his back, only to find that his gun, usually holstered behind him, was left in the cabin. However, his eyes swept to his two men on either side of him before immediately moving. He quickly unholstered one of their guns, aiming its muzzle and saying in a deep, cold voice, “That’s correct. I’m Karst. Your distinguished self has a special background and is doing something I thought that only God could do. But I just recalled something all of a sudden; that you’re not any god, for this world has no god whatsoever!”</p><p>“Who said I’m not a god?” teased Tang Guang with a smile. “Many people view me as a god.”</p><p>“You’re wrong.” Karst sneered and said, “Hmph, you’re just a quite powerful ability user, no more. Your special ability should be water manipulation, right?”</p><p>“Me, an ability user?” responded Tang Guang with contempt. “You actually are comparing me to those ability users? Do feast your eyes carefully on what I’m capable of doing!”</p><p>Having said that, he slowly raised his arm. Two blobs of flame suddenly appeared on his palm that immediately invited exclamations of shock from the girls in bikinis on the yacht.</p><p>Pupils shrunk, Karst said with a shocked voice, “You are an Elementalist with water and fire attributes? You… who… exactly are you?”</p><p>Rolling his eyes in response, Tang Guang coldly snorted and said, “You got a frozen brain, huh? What a retard!”</p><p>The instant after, the two flames floating above his palms flashed and hit the yacht, leading to a violent explosion the moment they hit, killing Karst, his two bodyguards and all the bikini girls in just a second.</p><p>“Heng…” a cold snort was heard.</p><p>Tang An in her usual black suit and bronze mask coldly glanced at the exploding yacht and the floating corpses on the sea surface as she indifferently said, “You made a mistake. You talked too much, making you an unqualified assassin.”</p><p>“Who said that I’m an assassin in the first place?” grinned Tang Guang after turning around, “I’m always a warrior who openly charges forward in battle. It’s your role as an assassin who strikes from the dark, An.”</p><p>“Heh, ambushes and surprise attacks are always the better fight in battle,” sneered Tang An, “It’s best for you to learn spacetime-based spells, you know!”</p><p>“What I need is a higher level of cultivation and individual combat force, though you would definitely benefit from spacetime-based spells yourself.” Tang Guang waved and said, “Alright, you’ve told me this countless times already; aren’t you getting tired of bothering me? Haih, it seems that I need to speak with Boss whether he can keep you guarding him, saving myself from having you pester me every day.”</p><p>Tang An glared at him before she released her sword out of thin air. Sword energy then flashed, precisely striking all the dead bodies. Her figure then flickered and disappeared into the air.</p><p>Tang Guang rolled his eyes in response before he turned around and flashed in the direction of Saipan.</p><p>****</p><p>Tang Xiu enjoyed himself in the villa of the Lao Bay Resort, sunbathing and allowing the sea breeze to massage his skin. At the moment, he remembered Zhang Xinya since he felt that if she were to come back with him at this moment, she probably would stay by his side, massaging his arms and legs and devoting herself to serve him with her lovable manner.</p><p>As of late, she had practically been staying around him constantly and literally agreed to his every activity. She kept accompanying him often whenever he had things to do as long as they were together. But this time, Zhang Xinya didn’t come with him. She said that she liked Nine Dragons Island and was prepared to stay for a while there, mentioning that she should give herself a holiday and vacation.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>A blurry figure flashed from a distance and appeared in front of Tang Xiu in the blink of an eye. It was Tang An with her usual black robe and bronze mask as she greeted respectfully, “Karst is dead, Grand Master.”</p><p>“With you doing the job, I can rest assured about that, An,” said Tang Xiu with a smile. “Also, where’s Guang? How come you’ve reported alone?”</p><p>“Ah, about brother….” Replied Tang An with a helpless expression, “He… he went to find himself a woman.”</p><p>“Ehh?!” Tang Xiu stared blankly and asked in a surprise, “He actually went out to find himself a woman? Is he in love with someone?”</p><p>“Hmph… the woman he’s looking for is not a decent one,” said Tang An with a resentful face. “He just dumped himself into some obscene place in the resort, justifying it by saying he is venting his murderous impulse.”</p><p>“Pfft.. haha…”</p><p>Tang Xiu shook his head with an expression between tears and laughter. “I thought that Tang Guang had a different sexual orientation and didn’t like women. It turns out… well, let him be. Let him do what he wants. It’s normal for men to vent out their physiological needs, to begin with.”</p><p>The response, however, made Tang An zone out, and she replied with a helpless face again, “Boss, I see you as a person with a proper manner. How can you indulge your subordinate with drowning himself in such a messy obscenity? What I want to say is, you should drag my brother out and give him a hard lesson, then give him a death command to never fool around with such women in the future.”</p><p>Her request made Tang Xiu force out a wry smile. “I don’t think I have the right to poke my nose into his private affairs, do I? Tang Guang is a grown-up man and he has his own preferences. I may be his Grand Master, but it’s not like his affairs are something I must manage. An, he’s indeed your brother, but I advise you to give him some space with his private life. Besides, he won’t act so unruly and indulge himself anymore once he has enough playing around or has met the woman he loves in the future. Then what about you? You’re also an adult, and you should also have some time for your love life and find yourself a good boyfriend, no? Our Everlasting Feast Hall has many good men. Do you have anyone that has entered your eyes?”</p><p>Having the topic rebounded back at her by Grand Master was something Tang An never expected to occur. Ever since she met and stayed around Tang Xiu, she came to a realization that other men simply couldn’t compare to her Grand Master. Despite the fact that he was a bit a fickle in love affairs and also had many women, he was an outstanding man given that he was not the kind who indulged himself in debauchery and slept with women without any sort of affection whatsoever. Just this sense of responsibility was countless times better than her own big brother.</p><p>“There’s no way I can tell you that, Grand Master.”</p><p>Tang An stomped her feet with womanly shyness on her face before she disappeared.</p><p>“Hahaha…”</p><p>Tang Xiu raucously laughed. As he stopped laughing, he fished out his cell phone and dialed a number. After his call got picked up, he said, “Karst is dead and the following matter will be yours to take on, Uncle. I’m leaving Saipan with my men tomorrow to go to Bangkok to deal with something.”</p><p>“Great! Worry not about that. There won’t be any problem with me and Tom Reggie here,” a pleasantly surprised voice belonging to Song Guanghui came replying from the phone.</p><p>Tang Xiu replied shortly and then hung up directly.</p><p>****</p><p>Early in the morning, as the first ray of sunlight greeted the world, Tang Xiu, who was sitting cross-legged on the reef on the beach, opened his eyes. He had spent all night absorbing the magical force in the Demon Stone, causing the planet in space inside his body to slightly enlarge. The other exoplanets, however, were still lifeless and unchanged.</p><p>“Grand Master.”</p><p>Looking highly spirited, Tang Guang stood several meters away in front of Tang Xiu. He immediately floated forward upon seeing Tang Xiu wake up from his cultivation state and respectfully greeted.</p><p>“Had some fun and enjoyed yourself yesterday?” asked Tang Xiu smilingly. “Well, your little sis came running to me and complained about it, you know.”</p><p>“Ugh…” Tang Guang stared blankly and immediately let out a dry smile. “Well, I’ll pay attention to it later, Grand Master.”</p><p>“Nah, there’s no need to take any action. I don’t care about that.” Tang Xiu waved and said, “Just try to hide it from the sight of women, though, and do pay attention to safety measures if you don’t know the exact details of your partners. Anyway, I don’t want to give you a sermon on this matter. Just tell Awu and the rest to pack up. We’re leaving.”</p><p>“Anyway, Singluen wants to see you, Grand Master,” said Tang Guang. “He’s been waiting for you for several hours. I was going to wake you up, but he told me not to.”</p><p>“Is it urgent?” asked Tang Xiu with a frown.</p><p>“I don’t know exactly what the matter is, but it seems urgent given his expression,” answered Tang Guang.</p><p>Tang Xiu nodded and turned his head to look towards the direction of a sound of approaching steps dozens of meters away. His eyes then caught Singluen treading toward his position, and he flickered to appear before him, asking, “Something happened?”</p><p>“I just received a summon to return to the clan, Mr. Tang. The order was issued by my Father last night,” said Singluen hurriedly. “I must return to the clan no matter where I am, so I’m afraid that something has happened.”</p><p>“An order to return to the clan?” Tang Xiu frowned.</p><p>“Yeah, it’s a death decree that only the Clan Patriarch can issue,” explained Singluen. “Any members of the Dark Shaman Clan, regardless who and wherever they are, must return to the clan at once. In the past, it has been issued by the Patriarch when my clan encountered a life-and-death crisis. I never thought that it would also be issued again now.”</p><p>“Is your Dark Shaman currently facing some troubles?” asked Tang Xiu.</p><p>“I just called my men in Bangkok a few hours ago. He hadn’t heard anything about the crisis facing my clan.” Singluen shook his head.</p><p>A particular expression flashed in Tang Xiu’s eyes, and he said in a deep voice, “I need you to answer a question honestly. If your father must select a successor, who do you think he will choose? You, or your big brother?”</p><p>“I’ve long thought about this matter and have already reached a conclusion about it,” said Singluen with a bitter expression. “No matter how much I don’t want to admit it, the fact is that I know my Father will definitely choose my big brother.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
