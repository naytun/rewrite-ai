I’ll always bear this huge benevolence in my heart. Feel free to call me whenever you have any need of my assistance in the future. As long as it is within my capability, I’ll never balk, even if I must cross a mountain of fire and sword.”</p><p>Yet, Song Donglai gave him a cold shoulder. He shook his head and said, “You don’t have to thank me. I didn’t even think that Tang Xiu would give me face actually. Of course, the main reason was because of my cousin since I think Tang Xiu appreciates him very much. If you want to thank someone, thank him!”</p><p>( NovelFull )     Li Qiang quickly waved and said, “No, Cousin. Boss Huang regards me as his brother. I naturally treat him like a respectable big brother, no less. There’s no need to thank me either.”</p><p>Boss Huang felt warm inside. He stretched his arms to hug Li Qiang and patted his back, saying, “Brother Qiang, I absolutely will never forget this grace. From now henceforth, you’re the Sales Manager of my company. Let us brothers share the joys and sorrows later!”</p><p>He was not a man without a brain. Firstly, it was needless to say that Li Qiang did save his life today. Just his identity as Song Donglai’s cousin was already enough to see him as a man to be reckoned with. Who was Song Donglai? Although this man couldn’t compare with Tang Xiu, he was also someone powerful, yet concealed himself deeply! Which one of his men was not an expert martial artist from the martial art community? The man himself was heaven-defyingly powerful!</p><p>For him, being able to make a relationship with such a powerful man through Li Qiang would be a great advantage for him in the future if he was able to forge a good relationship with him.</p><p>Song Donglai nodded with satisfaction and said, “Thank you for taking good care of my younger cousin, Boss Huang. Please continue doing that in the future. Also, you mustn’t forget what Mr. Tang has told you—otherwise, if he were to send someone to investigate you and find that you didn’t heed to his demand, I’m afraid that you would face a very severe consequence.”</p><p>“Sure, I will. I absolutely won’t forget it!” Boss Huang hurriedly nodded.</p><p>Song Donglai then waved and said, “Alright. Keep everything that happened here today to yourself. You must never disclose it even if you are drunk or dreaming. Otherwise, you don’t need Mr. Tang to act, for I will never spare you myself either.”</p><p>“Yes, yes, yes!”</p><p>Boss Huang and the surviving scar-faced man nodded as hard as they could. What happened today was beyond their cognition to begin with. Even if they had 100x more courage, they would never dare to disclose it, ever!</p><p>And yet, he had a bit of a headache. More than 20 of his men died. Taking out 10-million-yuan compensation for each person was not an issue to him, but how could he explain it to their families?</p><p>Li Qiang seemed to have seen his thoughts and said in a pressed voice, “Boss, we can say that they got a traffic accident together. You can even fabricate the scene of the accident with their cars exploded, then burn down and cremate their bodies.”</p><p>Boss Huang’s eyes lit up. He raised his thumb and praised Li Qiang, “That’s a great idea! You truly are my good luck, Young Qiang. I’m completely relieved that I’ll have you with me in the future. Do your job well. So long as your performance is excellent, I’ll give you the Deputy General Manager position of my company to you.”</p><p>“En, en!” Li Qiang intentionally put on a pleasantly surprised look and nodded repeatedly.</p><p>Half an hour later, Boss Huang had quietly transported more than 20 of his men’s dead bodies outside. Song Donglai, in fear that something would go wrong, also sent some of his men to help him.</p><p>By the lake.</p><p>Song Donglai and Ao Wei were sitting cross-legged, facing the waving sparkling surface of the lake, while the fatally injured Cruor Python was lying on the shore of the lake. It was still breathing, though without vigor, as it stared at Ao Wei, eyes expressing its hope to continue living.</p><p>Ao Wei took out a porcelain bottle from his sleeve. He pulled out the cork to pour out a red pill from the inside before throwing it into the Cruor Python’s mouth. The beast immediately swallowed it into its stomach. Shortly after, its body suddenly exploded, turning into a bloody mist that shrouded Ao Wei and Song Donglai two meters away.</p><p>“Let’s stimulate it now!”</p><p>The duo exchanged glances and stimulated all the important acupoints all over their body without a shred of hesitation. The blood mist that covered several meters of area in the surroundings didn’t drift with the wind, but constantly swirled and welled up towards them.</p><p>****</p><p>Haiqing Province.</p><p>Ning City was its capital city and the best city in the province, having the fastest development and growth economically. A lot of skyscrapers now decorated the city, along with a countless number of commercial establishments. All were connected with wide roads that outlined and extended in all directions.</p><p>Southern Municipality.</p><p>( NovelFull )     The Manor of the Miao Family covered more than 10 acres of land here. It was the place regarded by most of the Ning City locals as the most mysterious place. Its front gate was always tightly shut, overrun with guards who had strict discipline. The Miaos were the first family in Ning City and had a deep heritage and many offspring.</p><p>On the northern side of the place was a small artificial lake with a three-story European-style villa building. Inside the study on the second floor, Miao Wentang was now focusing on reading a stack of documents in front of him.</p><p>“4.8 billion yuan.”</p><p>Satisfaction revealed itself on his face after he saw the final summary of the number. Business was doing unusually well this year. The group under his family turned out to earn a total gross revenue of 4.8 billion in half a month, much to his satisfaction.</p><p>“How was it, Big Brother?”</p><p>An aging woman, yet still looking beautiful and retaining her graceful charm, sat across Miao Wentang and asked with a smile after seeing his expression.</p><p>“We’re doing great, Fengling,” replied Miao Wentang with satisfaction. “Our family’s business is getting bigger and better. I’m afraid that the pressure will be much greater in the future as well. You must have boldness and courage to shoulder it. Just tell me if you feel overwhelmed. I’ll assign more people to help you.”</p><p>Miao Fengling shook her head and smilingly said, “No need. I already have many assistants that can help me. Anyway, there’s an internal purchase issue in Star City, so what’s your decision regarding this issue? The Magnificent Tang Corporation and the Long Group have begun to move.”</p><p>Miao Wentang ruminated for a while before he shook his head and said, “If those two want to buy it, then let them. Besides, it’s already our good fortune, since we are kind of boarding other trains and obtained the rights to cooperate for the New City project. I’ve discussed this issue with some other shareholders, who likewise made the same decision.”</p><p>“That’s quite unfortunate, though,” commented Miao Fengling with a regretful expression. “That New City development and construction project is a gold mine. It will definitely become the largest and most prosperous city in the Shuangqing Province with many inhabitants and quite resourceful people living there. It’s truly regretful if we waste this kind of great opportunity.”</p><p>“What are you feeling pity for, though?” Miao Wentang smiled again and said, “The New City development project just entered the first phase. We’ll still have the second, third and fourth phase that will be issued later in the future. We won’t take part in this phase, but it doesn’t mean we won’t later. We’ll have a long time to make money as long as we keep relying on the Magnificent Tang Corporation and the Long Group in the future.”</p><p>“True that.” Miao Fengling nodded and said, “But I really want to meet Kang Xia, the General Manager of the Magnificent Tang Corporation. That woman is truly capable and amazing.”</p><p>“I don’t think so. The really capable and amazing one is not her, but her Boss, Tang Xiu.” Miao Wentang shook his head and continued, “I’m not saying that Kang Xia is not capable. She’s great of course. Besides, her feat for being able to capture Tang Xiu’s heart is already a heaven-defying ability, in and of itself.”</p><p>“I know Tang Xiu is a very capable and resourceful, Second Brother. But how can I meet such a high-ranking great personage myself?” Miao Fengling couldn’t help but laugh.</p><p>Ring, ring, ring…</p><p>Miao Wentang’s phone on the table rang. After he picked it up and saw the screen, a strange expression crept up on his face as he muttered, “Sometimes I feel like that we must not talk about this person at all. Speaking about the devil and the devil himself is now calling me. Anyway, I’m gonna pick up Tang Xiu’s call now.”</p><p>Having said that, he pressed the answer button and chuckled as he spoke, “Hey, Brother Tang, how come you remembered to call me?”</p><p>“Well, there’s something I need to deal with in Ning City, Brother Miao,” answered Tang Xiu. “Are you in Ning City currently? If you are, how about having a drink?”</p><p>Miao Wentang abruptly got up and excitedly exclaimed, “You’re coming to Ning City? That’s great! Where are you? I’ll catch up right away!”</p><p>“I just got off the plane, still at the airport,” said Tang Xiu with a smile.</p><p>“Wait for me there. I’ll hurry over!” said Miao Wentang without thinking.</p><p>“Just tell me your place’s address, Brother Miao,” said Tang Xiu. “I’m heading there directly, so we can save time.”</p><p>Miao Wentang thought for a moment before he nodded and said, “If so, then head to the Miao Family Manor in the Southern Municipality of Ning City. If you take a taxi, just tell the chauffeur directly about it. Only a few locals of Ning City don’t know where my family’s manor is.”</p><p>“Got it. Wait for me there,” said Tang Xiu with a smile.</p><p>Miao Wentang hung up the phone and looked up to see his sister, Miao Fengling, and said excitedly, “Tang Xiu has come to Ning City, Fengling. Immediately prepare everything and clean up our manor’s best guest room. You’ll also come with me to greet him later at the gate.”</p><p>Miao Fengling hurriedly complied and set out right away.</p><p>Half an hour later, Miao Wentang led Miao Fengling and all the core members of the Miao Family who were in the manor to the villa’s gate. All the six security guards, who were on guard duty at the gate of the manor, were shocked. While all the high-ranking members of the Miaos didn’t pay them attention, the security guards spoke to each other in whispers:</p><p>“Any of you know what’s happening? How come the family is kinda in a rush and so anxious today? Not only have most of the top members come out, but even the Patriarch is also coming outside. They seem to be waiting for some bigshots’ arrival.”</p><p>“I’m afraid some major event is going to happen to our Miao Family.”</p><p>“Who could the bigwigs possibly be? To think that they deserve our Patriarch coming out and greeting them personally? You guys also know that the family is unlikely to mobilize so many experts even if the top officials of the Haiqing province came here, right?”</p><p>“Well, we’ll know about it later, regardless.”</p><p>“…”</p><p>The time ticked by and ten minutes had passed. Yet, Miao Wentang and the rest of Miao Family’s members didn’t look impatient at all; some of the other high-ranking members who just came from the outside even hurriedly joined in the waiting.</p><p>It was a situation that gave another wave of shock to the Miao Family’s security guards.</p><p>“How long will it take Tang Xiu to arrive here, Big Brother?” asked Miao Fengling, who stood next to Miao Wentang, in a low voice.</p><p>“Around 50 minutes,” answered Miao Wentang. “It’s been 40 minutes, so he should be coming soon.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
