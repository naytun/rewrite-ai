The number might be on their side, but their strength was generally too weak.</p><p>In addition to that, more than 20 rabbles under Boss Huang were just ordinary people without much combat power either. Even though they formed three groups, the three elite experts of Lian Family just maniacally slaughtered them. Excluding the scar-faced big man, the rest of them were killed in just a few minutes.</p><p>Hiss, hiss…</p><p>The Cruor Python itself was being ganged up on by Lian Wentian and Lian Wenxin, having been badly battered by their barrage of attacks. Its blood-colored body was rolling and now trying to escape towards the lake. However, the black bottle that floated in the air unleashed a strong suction force and continuously released a gray-blackish mist, pulling all the souls of the killed humans’ bodies under it, swallowing into the Nine Fetuses of a Hundred Ghosts Streamer.</p><p>Lian Bai, the Patriarch of Lian Family, had also reached the martial arts grandmaster level and was quite formidable himself, even though his cultivation had yet to reach the new realm. After he brandished his saber to slash a man wearing a bronze mask and forced him back, he shouted sternly, “Who are you? Your strength is on par with Song Donglai, Ao Wei, and Gong Quan. You’re absolutely not their man!”</p><p>“Ask the King of Hell after you die!”</p><p>Han Sen’s wushu suit was rustling, and his crazy killing intent was locked on Lian Bai. Their strength was well-matched and the short exchange of blows made them feel like their qi and blood were surging all over their body.</p><p>“Hmph, hiding your head and tail. What a shameful shit you are!” grinned Lian Bai hideously. “Since you’re seeking your death, don’t blame me for being ruthless.”</p><p>Lian Bai brandished his saber right after he spoke, while his left hand quickly condensed a ball of fire. Along with his powerful strike, he threw the ball of fire that exploded into a blazing flame that stormed toward Han Sen.</p><p>“Elementalist?!”</p><p>Han Sen’s expression changed enormously. Just as he hastily moved to fend it off, the air behind him rippled as a dagger pierced his back all of a sudden.</p><p>“Dammit!”</p><p>Never once Han Sen dreamed that an assassin was hiding in the dark and had actually launched a sneak attack on him at this moment. A bit of despair filled his eyes, yet the madness inside him was raging more. Just as the dagger was piercing his heart, he threw himself toward the spot of the fluctuated air.</p><p>“You want me to die? Then I’ll drag you with me!”</p><p>Xiao Ya had just appeared in the air as Han Sen appeared in front of him, sweeping his saber and leaving a long, deep bleeding wound. Xiao Ya hadn’t yet reached the martial arts grandmaster level. He was best at assassination. He literally didn’t have enough time to avoid the strike of a martial art grandmaster powerhouse face to face.</p><p>“SAVE ME!!!”</p><p>Xiao Ya roared hurriedly. He could only pin his hopes on Lian Bai at this moment. If Lian Bai could kill Han Sen as quickly as possible, then he had a hope of living. Unfortunately, Han Sen knew that his heart was already pierced and realized that his death was imminent, so he ignored the attack from Lian Bai behind him. When the long blade in his hand beheaded Xiao Ya, his back was also injured and left a twenty-plus centimeters long deep wound.</p><p>A flame arrow then pierced Han Sen’s body, causing his lifeforce to elapse quickly. He coughed up a mouthful of blood and was hardly able to turn his head to glare at Lian Bai full of killing intent.</p><p>“Pity that I can’t drag you along to die with me!”</p><p>Likewise, Lian Bai was also seething with rage and killing intent. Xiao Ya was killed, a feeling like he just had his right arm cut off, making him difficult to breathe and feel distressed. It must be noted that Xiao Ya was very young. Even if he hadn’t yet broken through the martial arts grandmaster level, he would probably be able to reach it in the future.</p><p>He was a martial art genius, but he was killed just like that. Lian Bai truly couldn’t wait to hack Han Sen into pieces. But instead of continuing to attack, he stood a few meters away from him and spoke in a heavy voice, “Do you want to die that badly? Did you not see what my Ancestors have brought here? I tell you now. That’s the Nine Fetuses of a Hundred Ghost Streamer—an object that can devour human soul, transforming it into a resentful wraith and eternally trapping it inside the streamer. Just wait. You’ll struggle in endless pain soon, while your soul with scatter along with the destruction of the Nine Fetuses of a Hundred Ghosts Streamer some day in the future.”</p><p>Han Sen’s pale face only responded to his threat with contempt. He never believed of the existence of ghosts in this world. What souls and resentful spirits? All those were nothing but a damn unfunny joke.</p><p><em>Hmph…</em></p><p>A deep, yet chilling snort was heard. Han Sen was slightly shaken with a look of horror on his face. Even though he felt thankful for the rapid loss of his lifeforce, he could still clearly see the fear on Lian Bai’s face before him—the previously arrogant Lian Bai was now being grabbed on his neck by a young man behind him.</p><p>Tang Xiu indifferently glanced around before his eyes fell on Han Sen and he lightly spoke, “What he said is true. Had I not intervened, your soul would have been imprisoned. You’d suffer the cruelest torture all day and night until your body completely disappeared, then your soul would have turned into a resentful energy—the so-called resentful spirit. Once you get into such a situation, you will forever be unable to reincarnate. Just another form of a soul disappearing into nothingness.”</p><p>“Who are you?” shouted Lian Bai with a look full of fear after his neck was grabbed by Tang Xiu.</p><p>” <em>Hmph</em> .” Tang Xiu coldly snorted at him and asked, “Are you the Patriarch of the Lian Family?”</p><p>“I am,” answered Lian Bai quickly. “Let me go, otherwise you’ll become the enemy of my family. My two ancestors are here as well, and they are very strong!”</p><p>“Just two ants who have reached Qi Refining Stage, yet you call them very formidable?” Tang Xiu mocked him. “Truly a frog who looks at the sky from the bottom of a well. Your knowledge is too shallow.”</p><p>During his talk, two of the elite experts from the Lian Family blitzed over since they saw that Tang Xiu didn’t look back and slashed their sabers to cleave Tang Xiu from behind.</p><p>“DIE!”</p><p>Tang Xiu moved away lightning fast. As he appeared in an empty spot two meters away, his thoughts moved and dozens of electric sparks appeared out of thin air, shooting forward like arrows toward the two men’s vital points, directly killing them.</p><p>Lian Bai, whose neck was still being grabbed by Tang Xiu, could only helplessly watch his two family’s experts meet their tragic death. His heart was as though falling into an ice hole, birthing deep dread and fear inside him. Even though they hadn’t yet reached the level of martial arts grandmaster, they weren’t that far from it, but this young man could use such an electric special ability to kill them easily. His power was definitely ten times more powerful than the fire attribute special ability he possessed.</p><p>“ALL OF YOU, STOP!”</p><p>Tang Xiu looked at the two Lian Family’s ancestors who had joined forces to kill the Cruor Python and then looked around and shouted loudly. His deafening voice was like rolling waves that continuously transmitted in all directions.</p><p>Hundreds of meters away from him, Song Donglai and Ao Wei, who both struggled to fend off the four experts in the Lian Family’s encirclement, had been besmeared by blood. Gong Quan, on the other hand, had been killed and laid on the ground nearby.</p><p>“What happened?”</p><p>“The Patriarch?”</p><p>“Who is that?”</p><p>More than ten experts of the Lian Family stopped attacking and quickly gathered together. They looked at Tang Xiu as though they were facing a formidable enemy. But they couldn’t help but be shaken inwardly upon seeing that their Patriarch, Lian Bai, was actually caught by that person.</p><p>Lian Wentian frowned and shouted, “Wenxin, deal with this Cruor Python.”</p><p>After saying that, he flashed and instantly appeared ten meters away from Tang Xiu. Then he asked in a heavy voice, “Speak your conditions!”</p><p>Tang Xiu just shot him a cold look and apathetically said, “Awu, grab that old fossil. And drag that Cruor Python over to me.”</p><p>“Affirmative!”</p><p>Mo Awu, who had been following Tang Xiu in sprinting down from the hillside, dashed toward Lian Wenxing like a lightning bolt and appeared in front of the old man nearly in a flash, causing the latter to have a huge change in expression. Mo Awu then delivered a heavy punch to his stomach and sent him flying backward. He closely tailed him and instantly imitated Tang Xiu’s method in grabbing his neck.</p><p>“Get down to me!”</p><p>There was no technique nor skill in the least—just a straight punch, as he once again bombarded the Cruor Python’s body, causing it to let out shrill hissings. Mo Awu slammed his feet and kicked it, causing it to fly backward. It then heavily fell to the ground 20 meters away in front of Tang Xiu. It struggled and hissed but was unable to move at all.</p><p>So high-handed, and so powerful!</p><p>Mo Awu’s show of strength made everyone present feel a chill down their spines. More so for the Lian Family as their eyes turned wide open, bigger than a bronze bell, shocking them to the extreme and causing them to pace back subconsciously.</p><p>“Mr. Tang.”</p><p>At this time, those who felt joy and gratitude were none other than Song Donglai and Ao We. The duo had already noticed that Han Sen had been badly hit and injured, and it seemed that he wouldn’t survive given his injuries. They thought that they wouldn’t escape death here. The had never expected that Tang Xiu would act and deal with the situation all of a sudden.</p><p>Tang Xiu only nodded to him in response. His left hand kept forming secret art seal, while the Nine Fetuses of a Hundred Ghosts Streamer that had been suspended in midair was as though being pulled stiffly by a cart before he finally grabbed it.</p><p>“Did you refine this object?”</p><p>At this moment, Lian Wentian was likewise scared out of his wits. He thought that he and his brother, who had been cultivating for more than 100 years, had their strengths reach the peak of perfection. Never did he expect that such an undistinguished middle-aged man could neutralize and capture Lian Wenxin so easily.</p><p>“Who are you?”</p><p>Lian Wentian didn’t answer Tang Xiu’s question and asked loudly with a face that seemed like he was facing a very formidable enemy.</p><p>Tang Xiu sealed Lian Bai’s acupoints and threw him to the ground like a dead dog. Then he indifferently replied, “Who I am is not important. What more important is, did you or did you not refine this object?”</p><p>Lian Wentian took a deep breath and said, “We did. We refined it.”</p><p>“You members of the Lian Family are truly damned! You dare refine this wicked, evil, and sinister Ghost device!” said Tang Xiu coldly.</p><p>As his voice fell upon everyone present, Jin Shi, who stood next to Tang Xiu, instantly blitzed and punched Lian Bai lying on the ground, directly killing him. With a seething killing intent, he then glared at Lian Wentian and Lian Wenxin.</p><p>Lian Wentian’s pupils contracted and he roared, “You dare to kill my Lian Family’s current Patriarch? Do you really want to be a mortal enemy with my family?”</p><p>” <em>Hmph</em> , you want to become my enemy relying on your Lian Family alone?” snorted Tang Xiu coldly.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
