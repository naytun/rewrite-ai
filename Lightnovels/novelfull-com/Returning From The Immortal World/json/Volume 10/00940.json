She was sweating from head to toe and gasping for breath. The pain she felt was like having her body sheared by a knife, generating the increasing fear inside her heart. She felt like she would definitely die if she kept soaking herself in the bathtub.</p><p>“Is it very painful, Mom?”</p><p>Yue Li, who was supporting her, could see her distressed and pained look as she asked with deep concern.</p><p>Cui Yanru’s whole body trembled. She lifted her trembling hand to rub off the sweat on her flushed face, replying with a hoarse voice, “It’s painful like countless ants biting my body. I have had injuries and have experienced physical pain countless times before, yet none could compare with soaking in this water. Lili, if you can’t endure it later, just come out.”</p><p>“I know, Mom. I know.” Yue Li nodded and took a deep breath.</p><p>She trusted Tang Xiu and firmly believed that he wouldn’t harm them. After all, this man fulfilled his promise to pay 100 million USD to them. He absolutely wouldn’t harm them for no reason at all. Hence, she undressed and walked into the bathtub barefoot. She then felt the water temperature which hadn’t cooled off even though her mother had been soaking inside for 10 minutes.</p><p>“I can do it.”</p><p>Yue Li clenched her fists and slowly sat in the warm water in the tub. She began to feel very comfortable at first. But then, itchiness came from inside her, as if countless brushes were now stroking her body. A half-minute later, however, it was replaced with a growing pain all over her body.</p><p>“It’s painful, Mom.”</p><p>Clear tears were now gleaming and whirling in her eyes. Her pretty face was flushed red, and green veins on her forehead throbbed and protruded out; thus, she could only speak such a short sentence through hissing.</p><p>Cui Yanru, who had taken a break, felt that the pain in her body had disappeared a lot. She now looked at the painful look on her daughter’s face and replied with concern, “Come out if you can’t stand it, Lili! Mom already experienced it and knows how painful it is. You have no illness, so you don’t need to experience it as Mom did.”</p><p>Yue Li may look delicate, but she had a stubbornly strong will. Combined with her trust in Tang Xiu, she stubbornly shook her head and said, “I can do it, Mom!”</p><p>Time fleeted by, and, after over five minutes, the painful expression on Cui Yanru’s face gradually disappeared and ruddiness now moved to replace it on her face. Shortly after, she felt that the itchiness that was raging inside her body now turned into a warm sensation. She even felt that her body began to restore its strength, growing in power.</p><p>‘It feels… so comfortable?’</p><p>Cui Yanru zoned out for a while. She suddenly looked at Yue Li and called out with pleasant surprise, “I don’t feel any pain again, Lili! It’s… I feel… very comfortable now, more comfortable than I’ve ever felt, even compared to when I wasn’t ill. Divine Doctor didn’t lie to us. I can feel that I’m getting stronger.”</p><p>Yue Li, on the other hand, was now suffering in pain at the moment. She even had a thought of giving up several times. But when she heard her mother’s exclamation, her spirit soared and she gritted her teeth to continue holding on. After a few minutes, when she felt that she couldn’t hold on anymore and her body would break apart if she remained, she finally got up and came out of the bathtub, albeit while struggling in the process.</p><p>Outside the bathroom.</p><p>Yang Pengchao was restless and paced back and forth anxiously. If it wasn’t for his future mother-in-law also being inside the bathroom, he could’ve rushed inside to see Yue Li’s situation. Tang Xiu said that the process of soaking inside the warm water with that medication would be very painful, so he was afraid that Yue Li would face some problems.</p><p>Originally, he had full trust in Tang Xiu, but the treatment process he just heard was absurd and he couldn’t believe it. A drop of medicinal liquid can cure leukemia? It’s not a very funny joke to him!</p><p>Right now, he was thinking for a long time outside the door. Even the idea to take Yue Li’s mother abroad to seek treatment at the best hospital overseas came to his mind should Tang Xiu’s treatment not work. In his heart, Cui Yanru was also his mother, even though she was actually Yue Li’s. They might have just gotten along these last few days, but he could feel that she warmly treated him as a true family member and his elder.</p><p>Creak…</p><p>The bathroom’s door was opened and Yue Li appeared in neat attire in front of Yang Pengchao. Behind her was Cui Yanru neatly dressed as well.</p><p>“Yue Li, you…”</p><p>Yang Pengchao truly couldn’t believe his own eyes. Yue Li looked like she had just been reborn at this moment. Her whole being looked so fresh, stunning, and gave off a dazzling halo. Her skin seemed fairer than it used to be, looking extremely smooth and glossy.</p><p>“What happened?” asked Yue Li in surprise. “Why are you looking at me with such a face? Is there something wrong with my face?”</p><p>Only then did Yang Pengchao sober up from his daze as he murmured, “You look much more beautiful, Yue Li. Your skin seems much fairer and better than it used to be.”</p><p>“Huh, is that so?”</p><p>With a shy smile on her face, Yue Li came to the mirror in the room after stepping out of the bathroom.</p><p>Yang Pengchao was about to follow her, but his eyes advertently caught Cui Yanru. It was just a short glance, but his body trembled and the disbelieving expression on his face reappeared again. The shock he got this time was truly big. Before Cui Yanru entered the bathroom, she was spiritless, languid, pale, and her skin looked to have lost its luster. It may be because of her age, so she simply looked that old.</p><p>But now… the current Cui Yanru seemed like she had just shed skin. She looked like she was tens of years younger, just like in her teens. Her skin was equally fair and full of luster; her whole being was full of spirit, not seeming like she had leukemia at all.</p><p>“What…”</p><p>Yue Li, who was standing in front of the mirror, covered her mouth as she cried out in shock after looking at herself in the mirror. She never dreamed that she would become so beautiful. Not even in her dreams did she think such amazing changes would happen to her, especially to her skin, as it was… it was like a baby’s.</p><p>‘How can this be…’</p><p>Her heartbeat sped up and pounded hard. Such a shock, though a happy one, made her whole being stunned.</p><p>“Hey, Yue Li, have you looked at Auntie’s appearance?” Yang Pengchao called out quickly, “She seems to have turned tens of years younger. She looks like she is in her teens now; I don’t think she looks like a terminally ill person at all.”</p><p>Yue Li turned around, and only then did she realize that her mother was indeed different than before. She suddenly recalled what Tang Xiu had said and immediately spoke to Yang Pengchao, “What do you think? Has that drop of medicinal liquid really cured Mom of leukemia?”</p><p>Yang Pengchao thought for a moment and asked back hastily, “There’s still some time left before the two hours of time is over; should we go to the hospital to have a checkup?”</p><p>Yue Li’s mind moved, but then she realized that the time was too tight, so she shook her head and said gently, “I believe Divine Doctor Tang, Pengchao. He said that he can cure Mom’s leukemia, so she’ll be cured. You just saw it, didn’t you? We just soaked in that medicinal bath, which already has made our appearance change so much better than before. Let’s just wait for him to come over. We’ll talk about the idea of going to the hospital after that.”</p><p>“I think Lili is right, Pengchao. Haste makes waste,” added Cui Yanru. “And although I feel that I’m much stronger and better than even before I got sick, it’s better to wait for now rather than be anxious. Let’s ask Divine Doctor Tang about the effect first when hecomes.”</p><p>“Alright, then.”</p><p>Yang Pengchao nodded. His trust in Tang Xiu raised again several points.</p><p>Half an hour later, Tang Xiu then came back to this building along with Ouyang Lulu. After seeing Cui Yanru and Yue Li’s new look, he immediately smiled and said, “The external effect looks good, but I am yet to know how effective the treatment is. Alright, Ms. Cui, I’m going to check your pulse again to check your condition.”</p><p>“Alright,” said Cui Yanru hurriedly.</p><p>After taking a seat, Tang Xiu conducted a thorough examination and found that the harmful white blood cells inside Cui Yanru’s system had been completely eliminated. He immediately praised the effectiveness of the Body Refining Liquid inwardly as it turned out to have such good effect in treating patients indeed.</p><p>“What’s my condition now, Divine Doctor Tang?”</p><p>Seeing that Tang Xiu retracted his hand back, Cui Yanrui hurriedly asked.</p><p>“The effect is great. All the harmful white blood cells in your system have been removed,” said Tang Xiu with a smile. “But if you don’t feel relieved, you can go to a large hospital to have a check-up. If they say that you’ve been cured, you don’t need to come back here and can leave directly. Of course, you can also return here and stay for a few days if you still want to stay in Shanghai.”</p><p>Having said that, he then looked at Yang Pengchao and said with a light smile, “Don’t forget your commitment. After you’ve settled this, remember to come to Star City and find the General Manager of Magnificent Tang Corp.—Kang Xia. She’ll arrange everything for your work.”</p><p>“B-Boss… Boss Tang, can I take them to Star City with me as well?” asked Yang Pengchao. “Since I must work in Star City later, I wish that they can also live there, so that I can take care of them.”</p><p>“That would be the best.” Tang Xiu smiled and said, “Anyway, you’re specially scouted and hired by me, so you would usually be assigned a house in Star City. But you’re a rich man now, so buy it yourself instead.”</p><p>“Hehe,” Yang Pengchan grinned and said, “You gave that much money, Boss. It’s enough even if I bought 100 of them. Also… Should I take Auntie to the hospital to have the check-up first?”</p><p>“Go then.”</p><p>Tang Xiu smiled lightly.</p><p>After their departure, Ouyang Lulu stood before the window and asked, “What’s your next plan then, honey? It’s summer holiday, so your campus is on holiday too. Got some time for a vacation?”</p><p>Tang Xiu only bitterly smiled and said, “Even if the campus is not on holiday, I won’t be able to properly attend class either. I don’t think I can have anything like a vacation as I need to go to Thailand next. There are some things I need to deal with there.”</p><p>Ouyang Lulu’s expression changed and she asked, “Is it about the jade zodiac carving? You caught the news of the jade pig?”</p><p>Tang Xiu didn’t tell her the issue about Zhang Xinya. But in any case, he indeed still had to leave for Thailand to conclude the issue about the jade pig while in passing, so he said, “That’s right. I’ve collected half of the zodiac jade carving, so I need to find and collect the rest of them as quickly as possible.”</p><p>“Would you like me to go with you?” asked Ouyang Lulu.</p><p>“If there’s no expansion of Paradise Manor, you can actually tag along, Lulu.” Tang Xiu replied with a smile, “But you now have things to do here, so you can’t. Don’t worry, though. I should be back soon.”</p><p>“How about stopping by the project first, then?” asked Ouyang Lulu again. “I just want to go out with you. It’s been a long time since the last time we had a date!”</p><p>Comments ( 2</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
