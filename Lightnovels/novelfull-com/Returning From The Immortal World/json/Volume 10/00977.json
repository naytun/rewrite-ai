I can let this slip this time, but do not bring any more gifts. I’m already very happy with you simply visiting us.”</p><p>“I’ll be sure to remember that, Auntie,” said Tang Xiu smilingly.</p><p>Afterward, they entered the inner courtyard and took a seat in the living room of the villa. Wen Jing then personally served some fruits and snacks and even made some tea, all of which made several housemaids nearby dumbfounded and exchange glances in confusion.</p><p>Upon seeing his mother’s busy figure, Song Xiang smiled and said, “Well, you really got a big face, Tang Xiu brother. You see, even when that emperor-like Dad of mine comes home, Mom is rarely busying herself like that. Looking at her attitude and treatment toward you makes me quite envious of you.”</p><p>“Well, that’s the love shown by Auntie for me,” responded Tang Xiu with a smile. “That’s right, Auntie’s complexion is rather pale; does she have an illness?”</p><p>The smile on Song Xiang’s face slowly receded. His eyes glanced at Wen Jing, and he said bitterly, “Mom has been sick with a serious illness that doesn’t have a cure. It’s just that we’re hiding it from her.”</p><p>“It’s a liver disease, isn’t it?” asked Tang Xiu.</p><p>Song Xiang was stunned and asked in surprise, “How do you know that?”</p><p>“I have another identity in China as a young Divine Doctor in Chinese medicine,” said Tang Xiu. “I just observed her complexion a moment ago and my finger happened to touch her pulse when she grabbed my hand. Hence, I was able to tell that she contracted quite a serious liver disease.”</p><p>With eyes full of incredulity, Song Xiang stared at Tang Xiu. Only after Wen Jing came over with tea did he finally come back to his senses. He said with amazement, “You’re really amazing, Brother Tang; you’re just awesome. I can say that I’m quite knowledgeable about Chinese medicine. Those who are hailed as Divine Doctors or miracle-working physicians have always been figures with amazing expertise in this field. Even many Chinese medicine practitioners who have been in the field for decades are not necessarily qualified to be called a Divine Doctor. That’s right; I heard there’s a famous Divine Doctor in China called Gui Jianchou. It’s a pity that I have been unable to find his trace even though I’ve sent some people to China many times.”</p><p>“I know Divine Doctor Gui Jianchou. I have even worked with him for many days before,” said Tang Xiu smilingly. “He’s indeed a great senior doctor of a noble character, highly respected, and one with great expertise in medical skills. I also know how to contact him.”</p><p>Song Xiang abruptly got up and hurriedly said, “Brother Tang, please tell me how to contact him quickly! I need to find him. I must.”</p><p>“Who exactly are you looking for? Xiang’er?” asked Wen Jing as she arrived with tea. There was a puzzled look on her face.</p><p>Song Xiang’s face slightly changed, and he gave a signal with his eyes to Tang Xiu quickly before he quickly responded with a dry smile, “It’s just an old friend I know, Mom. It’s been a very long time since I last met him, so I didn’t expect that Brother Tang Xiu would also know him and could contact him after this chat.”</p><p>Wen Jing looked at Tang Xiu and asked, “Is that so?”</p><p>Instead of answering her question, Tang Xiu just slightly smiled and said, “Auntie, I can see that your body seems to be in a poor state, so you should have been ill for a while. Do you mind letting me treat you? I happen to have some expertise in Chinese medicine. I dare not say that there’s a 100% guarantee that I can cure you, but I am at least 99% sure.”</p><p>“What a darn fart!”</p><p>A disagreeing voice came from the door as a young man wearing a white t-shirt, denim pants, a hat, and slippers walked inside. He looked a bit angry as he came to Tang Xiu’s front and said loudly, “Hey, kiddo. Where the heck did you come from? You dare to spit bullshit in our house and even talk about Chinese medicine? Do you even know what Chinese medicine is, huh?”</p><p>Tang Xiu shifted his gaze and looked at his face. He was able to recognize this young man’s identity at once. He didn’t even have the slightest anger at all and instead put out a faint smile as he stretched out his hand and said, “You’re Song Yang, right? I’m Tang Xiu. Nice to meet you.”</p><p>Song Yang rolled his eyes and then raised his nostrils upward, saying, “I never shake hands with nobodies, let alone with people I don’t like. I’ve heard about Uncle Tang and I admire him. But you… hmph… don’t expect me to look up at you just because you’re acting like a passionate person.”</p><p>“Hey, shut up!”</p><p>“Shut your mouth!”</p><p>Wen Jing and Song Yang shouted at the same time.</p><p>Tang Xiu only smiled in response as he waved his hand. He looked at Song Yang’s contemptuous expression and lightly smiled, “Well, you seem so hostile to me. Care to tell me the reason?”</p><p>“Why should I? How old are you, kid? Hmph…” sneered Song Yang as he said, “I thought Uncle Tang’s son would also be a heroic-like figure just like him. But I never thought that you’re just a braggart—one who doesn’t know the immensity of heaven and earth.”</p><p>A braggart who doesn’t know the immensity of the world?</p><p>In that instant, Tang Xiu understood why Song Yang was hostile to him. It was because he took the initiative to treat his Auntie, Wen Jing, from her illness, thus causing his ire. It was no surprise since Song Xiang told him that they had been hiding the condition of their mother’s illness, rubbing him the wrong way and naturally making him angry.</p><p>After figuring out the reason, Tang Xiu straightly ignored Song Yan and looked at Wen Jing instead, saying, “Auntie, you don’t yet know what kind of illness you’ve contracted, but you should be experiencing painful attacks often, right?”</p><p>Wen Jing shot a look at her two sons first and fell into silence for a while. She then shook her head and sighed, “As a matter of fact, I know what illness I have. They think that they can hide it from me despite the fact that I already knew that I have liver cancer at a late stage.”</p><p>“What did you just say, Mom?” interjected Song Xiang hurriedly. “There’s no way you can get liver cancer.”</p><p>After glaring fiercely at Tang Xiu, Song Yang chimed in, “Please don’t make a blind conjecture, Mom. What cancer? You’ve definitely not contracted cancer. It’s just a minor illness. You’ll definitely be able to live for a hundred years in the future. I can tell that this damn man surnamed Tang is not a good man. Please don’t listen to him. I’m sure that he’s just trying to fool you.”</p><p>“What exactly happened to your head, Yangyang? When did Tang Xiu annoy you to make you always target him, huh?” scolded Wen Jing with a cold expression. “Whether he can cure my illness or not, the filial piety he shows me is just right!”</p><p>“He said that he knows Chinese medicine. But I said it’s a damn fart, Mom!” rebuked Song Yang with an unhappy face. “Those who have expertise in Chinese medicine are seniors in that field—ones who have real talents at that! Having the idea that he’s good at it is nothing but ridiculous. If anything, he can deceive others, but there’s no way he can fool me.”</p><p>“Well, I get where you’re coming from, especially the mood you have, but it’s best not to entertain any thought to the extreme.” Tang Xiu looked at him and said, “As for whether me being a practitioner of Chinese medicine is a lie or not, why don’t you see it for yourself? Auntie may not know how serious her condition is, but you should know about it, right? Since her sickness has arrived at this stage, how about letting me try to cure her? Won’t it become a fortunate matter that is worth rejoicing if I happen to be able to cure her?”</p><p>“You…”</p><p>Song Yang was about to rebuke, but he suddenly felt a numb sensation in his throat and was unable to let out any sound from his mouth. The moment after, his body trembled a few times, and some other parts went numb before his whole body was no longer under his control.</p><p>‘What the hell? What the fuck is going on with me?’</p><p>‘How can I not talk or be able to move at all?’</p><p>‘What exactly is happening? What were those numb sensations a while ago? Did my acupoints get attacked?’</p><p>His eyes chaotically glanced around nervously, yet he tried hard to free himself from the predicament. It was a pity for him that he was unable to no matter how hard he tried.</p><p>“Is there a quiet room, Auntie?” asked Tang Xiu. “Just trust me, just like the faith you had in my father and Uncle Song in the past.”</p><p>“Alright.”</p><p>Wen Jing sighed inwardly after looking at the three children in front of her. Ever since she noticed that her health was deteriorating and that she contracted an illness, she went to the hospital for a check-up and looked at the result herself. On the check-up report, it was clearly written that she had contracted cancer and the symptoms she had were exactly the symptoms that liver cancer patients suffered with.</p><p>However, even though she held similar thoughts as her second son, Song Yang, doubting that Tang Xiu could cure her liver cancer, it was Tang Xiu’s first visit to their home. It was also Tang Xiu’s goodwill in having the intention to treat her, a good starting point of their relationship. Hence, she didn’t reject Tang Xiu and even missed the abnormality happening to her son, Song Yang. She then led Tang Xiu to the end of the corridor and came to the massage room.</p><p>As for Song Xiang, he was keenly aware of the peculiarity happening to his younger brother. But he was more worried about his mother. He walked in strides to catch up to them as Wen Jing and Tang Xiu were about to enter the massage room. Song Xiang quickly reached out to grab Tang Xiu’s hand and said in a whisper, “Brother Tang, your guess is correct. Mom has contracted liver cancer at a late stage and her condition is quite serious. It’s almost impossible to cure her with the current level of medical care out there. Please don’t act recklessly. It’s fine to give up if you have no means since Mom is at least still alive.”</p><p>“No worries!” Tang Xiu slowly nodded and said, “I will use my discretion.”</p><p>As they entered the room, Tang Xiu gestured Song Xian to stop following them. Then, he closed the door from the inside before turning around to Wen Jing, smilingly saying, “Auntie, do you want to feel some comfort and enjoyment?”</p><p>“What comfort?” asked Wen Jing curiously.</p><p>“Tuina Massage. The method is a technique in Chinese medicine,” explained Tang Xiu with a smile. “Frankly speaking, I can tell that you’re doubting my expertise in this field too. The reason why you accepted my idea to treat you is that you don’t want to refuse my good intention for fear that it would make me feel embarrassed.”</p><p>Wen Jing observed Tang Xiu and suddenly found that this child in front of her was actually smarter and more sensible than she thought—a character that would become very powerful in the future. It was just unfortunate that she had contracted cancer, now at a late stage. Else, she wanted to witness the success and achievements that could stir the world be brought by this child in the future.</p><p>“I’ll try it then! Let your aunt see your ability, Tang Xiu. Auntie will definitely cook delicious meals that will satiate your cravings if your Tuina Massage skill is truly outstanding,” said Wen Jing with a smile as she laid down on the massage bed.</p><p>“Okay!” Tang Xiu nodded with a smile.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
