Regardless of whether Tang Xiu could cure his mother, just the fact that Tang Xiu was able to stay inside with such an intensely pungent odor all around was admirable.</p><p>“I’m fully convinced, Brother,” sighed Song Yang as he gasped while looking towards the massage room’s door, a bit of awe on his face.</p><p>“Hahaha. Now you admit it, huh?” Song Xiang loudly laughed. “We were only able to endure the pungent odor for a few minutes inside. It’s kinda a miracle for Brother Tang to treat it as nothing. Just this alone is enough for us to look up to him.”</p><p>Song Yang nodded, but he seemed to recall something all of a sudden and curiously asked, “Brother, can you tell what’s going on there? Could that grayish substance on Mom’s body be a special medicinal ointment concocted by Tang Xiu?”</p><p>“It should be.” Song Xiang nodded.</p><p>An hour then passed by in the blink of an eye. Song Xiang and Song Yang were waiting outside the massage room as Song Guanghui came rushing from the outside. When he saw his two sons standing at the massage room’s door, he creased his brows and quickly asked, “Where’s Tang Xiu, and what are you two doing here? Ugh… what’s this stench?”</p><p>“Tang Xiu is currently treating Mom in the massage room, Dad,” answered Song Xiang. “This stench comes from there and seems to be from some ointments used by him.”</p><p>Song Guanghui was stunned, but he suddenly remembered Tang Xiu’s identity as a young Divine Doctor. He immediately patted his forehead and said self-mockingly, “How the hell did I forget about it? Tang Xiu is hailed as a young Divine Doctor in Chinese traditional medicine in China, so he must have great expertise in this field… if he really can cure the illness of your mother…. That… that would be great!”</p><p>But Song Xiang poured out a bucket of cold water and said, “Let’s not be so optimistic for now, Dad. Even if he is touted as a miracle-working doctor of Chinese medicine in China, curing Mom would be very difficult. After all, cancer is not as easy to treat as other diseases to begin with. I’ve never heard of any hospital or doctor who can cure patients with cancer at a late stage, at least not at the present level of medical care today unless there’s some miracle in work.”</p><p>The reminder made Song Guanghui’s expression turned stiff, and he immediately nodded with a solemn expression.</p><p>Ultimately, as Tang Xiu opened the door from the inside, Song Guanghui, Song Xiang, and Song Yang shifted their gazes immediately. They could see a bit of a weary expression on Tang Xiu’s face. Song Guanghui then asked hurriedly, “How is your aunt, Tang Xiu? Was your treatment effective on her?”</p><p>“Rest assured, Uncle Song,” said Tang Xiu with a smile. “I have eliminated two-third of the cancer cells in Aunt’s body; only one-third of it remains in her system. I’ll stay in Saipan for the next two days to continue her treatment, so I should be able to remove all of the cancer cells in her body.”</p><p>“What did you say?” exclaimed Song Guanghui with a trembling body due to his shock.</p><p>Song Xiang and Song Yang were likewise shocked and dumbfounded, making them paralyzed as they stared at Tang Xiu with shocked faces, unable to utter anything for a long while.</p><p>“Actually, cancer is not a serious illness to me,” said Tang Xiu smilingly. “I have cured some patients with late-stage cancer before. They are now healthy, and even if they can’t live for a very long time, they should have decades to live their life.”</p><p>Grabbing Tang Xiu’s arm, Song Guanghui asked with a slightly trembling voice, “Is… is it… for real? Can you really remove all the cancer cells in your aunt’s system thoroughly? You… you can completely cure her?”</p><p>“That’s right,” said Tang Xiu with a faint smile. He could feel the excited mood Song Guanghui had.</p><p>Song Guanghui then released Tang Xiu’s hand and clenched his fists excitedly as he punched the air a few times. With a face turned red due to the excitement, he said, “It’s great. That’s really great! Blame me for not asking for your help earlier, otherwise, your aunt could’ve been cured of cancer already. Thank you, Tang Xiu. Thank you so much.”</p><p>“I know you’re very happy, Uncle Song. But please don’t mention it,” said Tang Xiu with a smile. I’m a Chinese traditional medicine practitioner, so it’s my duty to treat and free patients from their illnesses. Besides, we’re just like relatives, so it’s kinda an obligation for me after knowing that Auntie has contracted cancer. If I just did nothing and Dad knows about it, I’m sure he would definitely break my legs.”</p><p>“Hahaha… well said! We’re indeed a family, so I’ll skip all the polite talks with you,” said Song Guanghui. “That’s right, though. Can I go inside now to see your aunt?”</p><p>“Of course, you can,” said Tang Xiu with a strange expression. “It’s just… you gotta be mentally prepared, though.”</p><p>“Mentally prepared? What for?” asked Song Guanghui after staring blankly.</p><p>“Well, the cancer cells I forced out from auntie’s system are now plastered all over her body, producing the pungent stench from the impurities brought out by the cancer cells,” said Tang Xiu smilingly. “Hence, I think you’re the best person to wash auntie’s body, although you must endure this stench.”</p><p>Song Yang, who stood nearby, exclaimed, “What did you say, Tang Xiu? You mean that grayish-black substance on Mom’s skin is not a special ointment concocted by you? But… it is the impurities brought out by the cancer cells inside her system?”</p><p>“That’s correct.” Tang Xiu nodded with a smile. “I didn’t use any ointment at all. I just used acupuncture techniques to stimulate the potential of her body, and then controlled the cancer cells to be discharged out of her system.”</p><p>The answer made Song Yang stunned silly, whereas Song Xiang practically turned into a stone sculpture.</p><p>The two brothers’ gaze at Tang Xiu was as though they were seeing a kind of monster—one that was not purely bred on Earth, but instead was like a super monster from space. They had heard countless magical stories and they had also seen some bizarre things, yet they never encountered such an incredible situation like this.</p><p>Half an hour passed, and when Song Guanghui walked out of the massage room while propping up Wen Jing, he had already washed her body inside massage room’s bathroom. The pungent stench had completely dissipated, and now all they could smell was the nice-smelling coconut milk-flavored soap from Wen Jing.</p><p>“Thank you, Tang Xiu.”</p><p>The way Wen Jing looked at Tang Xiu was much softer and gentler than before. It was like she was looking at her own son, full of love and satisfaction.</p><p>Tang Xiu paced forward to support her arm and smilingly said, “There’s no need for such small talk between family members, Auntie. This is just what I should do.”</p><p>Nodding in response, Wen Jing then said, “You’re a good boy. Then I’ll skip the small talk. I feel a bit weak, but the pain caused by the cancer cells are gone. As time passes by, my body feels even more comfortable. It feels nice and warm, the kind of warmness brought by a heater.”</p><p>“You will indeed feel weak for some time.” Tang Xiu said, “It’s because you had so many impurities from cancer cells forced out of your system. As a matter of fact, the cancer cells’ impurities are also a kind of energy which can be said to be an extra energy source for your body, yet this kind of energy has a bad effect on your system instead of being beneficial. Have some rest for a while and then take some nutritious hot porridge, Auntie. I’ll prescribe something for you to boil and prepare later, so you’ll have a good sleep after taking it. You’ll feel a hundred times more energetic by morning.”</p><p>“Alright. But I must cook for you first before resting, though,” said Wen Jing smilingly.</p><p>“No need to cook for me, Auntie,” said Tang Xiu quickly. “Your body is too weak now.”</p><p>“That’s right! Tang Xiu can feel your good intention, but your body is more important.” Song Guanghui also nodded and added, “Besides, it won’t be too late to show your culinary skills to Tang Xiu after you get better tomorrow.”</p><p>“No. I like this child.” Wen Jing stubbornly shook her head and said, “This is his first time visiting our home, so I must cook for him myself. That’s right, don’t you have two bottles of fine wine in your collection? Go and get them. Let us all have a drink tonight.”</p><p>“Haih… alright.”</p><p>Song Guanghui was perfectly aware of his wife’s stubborn character. Nobody would be able to change her mind once she made it.</p><p>Upon seeing this, Tang Xiu no longer refused either and just signaled Song Xiang with his eyes. The two of them then helped Wen Jing to go to the kitchen to help her cook.</p><p>As for Song Yang, his eyes followed his mother and Tang Xiu as they vanished into the kitchen. He then turned his head to look at Song Guanghui and asked in a low voice, “Dad, do you really believe what Tang Xiu just said—that he can fully cure Mom?”</p><p>For a short while, Song Guanghui fell into silence before replying in a low voice, “I’ll tell you about something, Kid. But you must bury everything I tell you inside your stomach. There’s probably nobody in this world who can cure your Mom of cancer except Tang Xiu. He’s a cultivator, and if you don’t know what a cultivator is, you can search about the existence of cultivator on the net. But keep it in mind to never tell this to anyone, ever.”</p><p>A cultivator?</p><p>Song Yang nodded and whispered, “I don’t need to search for this type of information, Dad. I know what kind of existence a cultivator is. But then… isn’t that the kind of people regarded as deities and immortals in the myths? Those kinds of people really exist in this world?”</p><p>“They exist; I know that,” said Song Guanghui with a dead-serious expression.</p><p>In that instant, the expression in Song Yang’s eyes turned totally different than before. He gazed towards the kitchen with eyes full of enthusiasm, yet there was also thirst faintly mixed deep within.</p><p>Cultivators, as told in legends and myths, were those who could summon the forces of nature, change the seasons, and fly in the sky with a life that could span for centuries.</p><p>In case… that Tang Xiu was really a cultivator and truly possessed these abilities, then he must think of the means and do everything to learn from him.</p><p>After dinner, Wen Jing went to the bedroom to rest, whereas Song Guanghui took Tang Xiu, Song Xiang, and Song Yang to the study on the second floor. Song Yang diligently and attentively boiled a pot of tea and came to the front of Tang Xiu. Then, he poured a cup and handed it over to him, saying solemnly, “Big Brother Tang, you’re two years older than me, so I should call you Big Brother. This younger brother of yours was ignorant, so I hope you can tolerate me in the future.”</p><p>Tang Xiu received the cup of tea with a light smile and said, “We’re all brothers, so no offense taken.”</p><p>“You are truly a great man with a big heart and a broad mind, Big Brother Tang.” Song Yang responded with a wide smile. “We are brothers, so we must be close in the future.”</p><p>“That’s for sure.” Tang Xiu smiled.</p><p>Unaware that there was a small dispute between Tang Xiu and Song Yang previously, Song Guanghui interjected with a smile, “You’re all brothers, so you must be close to each other in the future indeed. I and Big Brother Tang Yunde are already old, so the future is for juniors like you to take. I really wish that I can witness you all make progress and support each other in life in the future.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
