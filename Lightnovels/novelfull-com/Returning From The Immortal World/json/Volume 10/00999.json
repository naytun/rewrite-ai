He paced a few steps forward and smilingly said, “There are too many people in the Stygian Club to count. But those people are nothing but insects in my eyes. It’s no surprise if you can kill some of them. But don’t boast today, and be careful with your tongue, lest we act and cut it off.”</p><p>“Hmph. How dare you be so arrogant and spit out such bullshit? You’re just a former Buddhist who has fallen into a demonic path and transformed your Dharmic divine power into a Demonic one?” sneered Tang Xiu. “Old fart, I also know some Buddhist and Daoist powers. Since you want to court your death, then I’ll fulfill your wish with the ability you most excel at.”</p><p>Death Dhyana Buddhist Master focused his attention on Tang Xiu now, looking a bit grave and dignified. He had indeed been a Buddhist practitioner and could be said as an eminent monk of his generation. It was a pity that his evil tendencies and thirst for blood had prevailed over his goodness, leading him astray and turning himself from a Buddhist into a Demon. He rebelled against the Buddhist school and then fled China, eventually becoming the Grim Reaper under the Stygian Club.</p><p>From the clash he had with Tang Xiu a moment ago, he had determined the latter’s identity as a Daoist cultivator. But how come a young Daoist cultivator is also proficient in Buddhists’ divine abilities? How can it be possible for one to excel at dual cultivation on the Buddhist and Daoist paths?</p><p>“Hmph. Don’t wag your tongue too freely. Bring it on; let me see what you can do!”</p><p>The Buddhist staff in his hand fiercely pierced the ground as a blast of aura spread out in all directions. The blast of qi swept all the broken trees, leaves, bricks and rubble in the surroundings directly and sent all of them flying away.</p><p>Vajra Rakshasha, whose body was wrapped by steel chains, suddenly treaded forward step by step. Dust flew upward as his right foot stomped on the ground, causing a small tremor, and he then threw a fist-sized steel hammer into the air. It immediately grew in size and enlarged to a weapon three-meters long with a gigantic hammerhead in a flash.</p><p>“Death Dhyana, you know I hate arrogant bastards the most, just like these shits! Especially those who wanna look like a fucking bigshot despite their young age. Stay still and lemme smash them into meatloaves!” Vajra Rakshasha raised his right hand. The moment after, the hammer fell into his grasp.</p><p>Overbearing, wild, and violent!</p><p>There was also contempt on his face, as if this Vajra Rakshasha didn’t take Tang Xiu seriously. He didn’t put everyone else in front of his eyes.</p><p>His provocation made Tang Xiu knit his brows deeply. This King Kong may look extremely imposing and strong, yet he didn’t feel much of a threat from this giant. The one who gave off a much bigger threat to him was none other than the Death Dhyana Buddhist Master. As he saw that King Kong was about to move, he retreated a few steps backward and ordered in a deep voice, “Guang, accompany him!”</p><p>Dressed in his usual white robe, the casual and elegant Tang Guang just let out a smile. His figure smoothly flew like a floating cloud with his immortal sword revolving around him. At the moment when he looked to be about to sprint toward the giant, the trajectory of his immortal sword changed, cunningly sealing off any possible routes for the Vajra Rakshasha to retreat back.</p><p>“Well, big fella, I hope you’re not the kind who looks big but is trash!</p><p>Vajra Rakshasha’s pupils shrunk. They just came here, and he knew nothing about Tang Guang’s power at all. But the latter’s speed sent a chill down his spine. He fiercely slammed his hammer down, and a series of sparks suddenly splashed. He indeed possessed enormous power and his speed wasn’t affected by the size of the hammer at all. The hammer’s shadows crazily swept to left and right as his footsteps made some sure footing forward.</p><p>“What I hate the most is fucking pretty boys like you! I’ll change my name to yours if I don’t kill you today!”</p><p>With a ferocious look on his face, the King Kong man sprinted and appeared before Tang Guang in no time. His fist that was the size of a cooking pot sent an onslaught of punches to Tang Guang’s forehead. The black chains that wrapped both his arms were constantly squeaking under the tremor of his bulging muscles.</p><p>A contemptuous look flashed in Tang Guang’s eyes. If it weren’t for the chains wrapping this giant’s arm, this King Kong may have been able to give him a headache, as he needed to find a better solution to deal with him. But now, a brilliant idea came to mind.</p><p>“Lightning…”</p><p>As he cast a seal, a flash of lighting suddenly blitzed down amid the dark night, accurately hitting the chains that wrapped the Vajra Rakshasha’s arm.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>King Kong’s body turned stiff. In an instant, a slit appeared on the hammer shadow shield he waved. The immortal sword then moved like a living creature and passed through the gap. The moment after, a blood fountain sprayed into the air and the huge giant’s head was thrown away.</p><p>Tang Guang retrieved his sword back and flew back to Tang Xiu’s front. With a casual and gentle look, he respectfully reported, “The enemy has been killed, Grand Master.”</p><p>Tang Xiu raised his thumbs up and praised, “The method you did was very effective. That fella was so proud and arrogant like Lucifer, yet he ended up being killed by you so easily. Anyway, it was tribulation he deserved, wasn’t it?”</p><p>Tens of meters away from them, Death Dhyana Buddhist Master stared at the headless corpse of Vajra Rakshasha with blood still spraying out from his neck. His eyes were gleaming with a look of disbelief. He was as though just swallowing up a dead rat, creating nausea in his stomach. He had long known Vajra Rakshasha and was naturally aware of how strong he was. Yet, he was easily killed by his enemy’s calculation of the chains that wrapped his body.</p><p>The two vampire-looking men behind him exchanged glances and stepped back at the same time. They also used chains as their weapons. They were afraid that if they had to fight Tang Guang, the latter would use the lightning bolt to paralyze them and then seize the chance to kill them with this despicable tactic.</p><p>“That was interesting. I never thought Vajra Rakshasha to be so unlucky, though. He ran into a cultivator proficient in lightning spells and just got killed like that by his opponent’s deadly scheme. Anyhow, would you like to exchange some moves with me, Mister?” The petite female with white hair and a ruddy complexion stepped forward and spoke to Tang Xiu with a faint smile.</p><p>Tang Xiu was silent for a short moment. Then, he suddenly smiled, revealing his white teeth, stating, “Well, having individual combat is kinda boring, though. It’s kinda wasting time and now it’s close to dawn already, so I think we better have a gang fight. What do you think about it?”</p><p>The petite female’s face immediately changed, and she replied with contempt, “Hmph, you wanna gang up on us because you got numbers on your side?”</p><p>“Yup. We’re gonna use our numbers to bully you. What’s wrong with it, anyway?” Tang Xiu nodded and smilingly replied, “If you’re so upset, why don’t you come over and bite me?”</p><p>“You court death!”</p><p>A baleful look burst out in the eyes of the female with a childish face and white hair. She took out a flute made of bone from her loose robe in that instant and blew it. As she played the flute, the residual branches and leaves around were instantly blown up by an invisible wind, forming a twisting wind.</p><p>Ding, ding, ding…</p><p>Suddenly, the sound of a metal string of a zither collided with the sound of walloping armored horse’s feet. Although the flute’s sound was loud, the zither sound was able to suppress it in but a moment. The twisting gale composed of broken leaves and branches instantly broken and scattered.</p><p>The female’s pupils shrunk, and her complexion enormously changed. The gale surged out and rolled ahead ceaselessly like a continuous flood at her.</p><p>At this moment, everyone present was looking northwest because the zither came from that direction. Tang Xiu’s eyes also sparkled. He had no idea that there was someone else lurking around them, more so that this person was also proficient in music, using its rhythm to help his side to fend off their enemies. It was evident that the other party was a friend.</p><p>“Thank you!”</p><p>Tang Xiu cupped his fists and spoke in a deep voice toward the northeast.</p><p>In that instant, the zither music turned fiercer and more violent. It was like a flash flood of ferocious beasts coming down from a mountain peak with abnormal overbearing momentum. It was acutely sharp and somewhat rushing forward, just like the sound of the friction between boulder and steel. Except for Tang Xiu, the rest felt tremors in their eardrums and their hearts trembled. But the childish-looking woman who became its target bore all the brunt and felt like an earthquake had hit her heart. She shook her head violently and was forced to stop playing her flute.</p><p>Puff…</p><p>She then felt salty sweetness in her throat before coughing up blood crazily. Her body then trembled and swayed a few times before staggering backward.</p><p>Shoo…</p><p>While she was unprepared, an immortal sword suddenly emerged behind her out of thin air. The complexion of Death Dhyana Buddhist Master and the other five greatly changed, yet it was too late for them to rescue the female as her head was cut off directly. Tang An’s figure then flickered before she vanished without a trace after her appearance.</p><p>Tang Xiu, however, looked at the northwest directly and shouted aloud, “Your distinguished self, why don’t you show up since you’ve come here? Tang Xiu is grateful and appreciates your assistance.”</p><p>A note of zither came out as the response.</p><p>As the last note dissipated, the world was back to its calm state. Silence descended, yet no one appeared. Tang Xiu quickly released his perception toward the northeast, only to frown afterward since the other party had left quietly. He guessed that the person had not yet gone far away, but the distance was beyond his scope of observation.</p><p>“You go!” Tang Xiu looked at Tang Guang and ordered.</p><p>Tang Guang slightly nodded in response. His figure flickered and left an afterimage as he instantly flew to the northeast. He appeared beyond ten kilometers away after half a minute. To his frustration, there was no shadow of the other party in the surroundings. It was as if the person’s speed was much faster than his, like the person had already left and was more than tens of kilometers away.</p><p>“I failed to find the person, Boss.”</p><p>After Tang Guang returned to Tang Xiu’s side, he reported with a bitter smile and shook his head.</p><p>Tang Xiu nodded wordlessly. That person didn’t want to appear, nor did he want to force it. In fact, he had a faint idea of who the person was, but he wasn’t 100% certain since he didn’t see the person himself.</p><p>Death Dhyana Buddhist Master shot a deep look at Tang Xiu and the rest. Murderous intent was looming in his eyes, yet he also had the intention to drawback. Two out of eight people among his party had kicked the bucket in just a short time, which was already a fearful occurrence to him. It must be noted that every time one of them went out, it was enough for each member to create a storm in the region and inflict severe damage to that area.</p><p>“You’re Tang Xiu and a cultivator from China?” asked Death Dhyana Buddhist Master in a deep voice.</p><p>“Yeah, I’m indeed called Tang Xiu and am Chinese cultivator,” confirmed Tang Xiu with a smile. “What’s wrong? Do you want to retaliate later so you asked me this question?”</p><p>“It’s just natural that I want to know the identity of our enemy,” replied the monk coldly, “Since we’re enemies, you can expect to have us retaliate against you in the future. Tang Xiu, huh? Hmph… I’ll remember your name.”</p><p>“You know, if you wanna run, just say so. Yet you’re still using words with me? Do you find it so fucking fun or something?” asked Tang Xiu a smile.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
