Even this morning, Tang Xiu found that many guests were literally scattered everywhere here. Many of them were families of three or couples enjoying the sunshine and the beautiful scenery of the venue.</p><p>“This is quite interesting…”</p><p>Tang Xiu sported a smile as he commented when excavators and hanging cranes entered his sight. Ouyang Lulu did tell him that she was going to set up a resort hotel in a spacious plot of land here, preparing it to be the best hotel resort. Since those construction vehicles were here, then her plan should have been set in motion already.</p><p>Knock, knock…</p><p>Just as Tang Xiu parked the car and looked at the construction in the distance, the car’s windows were knocked on from the outside. He looked outside and immediately saw Ouyang Lulu bend down, showing off the fair skin of her waving bust and deep cleavage. He let out a faint smile, opened the car’s door, and got out. He then shot a look at her clad in a fiery red dress with her elegant long black hair. Asking with a smile, Tang Xiu inquired, “So, you’ve started to build that resort hotel?”</p><p>“Yup! That’s why I’ve been looking forward to your return!” answered Ouyang Lulu smilingly.</p><p>“Huh? Looking forward to my return?” Tang Xiu stared blankly before he immediately burst into laughter and asked, “Hahaha, what does it have anything to do with me, though? I don’t even know how to build a resort hotel, you see. What I can do for you is to draw the design plan at best.”</p><p>Ouyang Lulu raised her brows. She then patted the back of her head with a regretful expression, “Damn. Why the hell did I forget that? I forgot you can design buildings yourself. I lost money for nothing. I even paid someone to draw the design for the resort. Bah, it’s no use to brood over it. Apart from some other stuff, you also gotta help me to make the design for our exclusive hotel then.”</p><p>“That’s OK with me. But what is this other stuff you just mentioned?” asked Tang Xiu with a smile.</p><p>She reached out and mischievously smiled. “Well, I’m short on money, so I want money.”</p><p>Cough, cough…</p><p>Tang Xiu was at a loss whether he should laugh or cry. “Wait, wait. If I recall correctly, haven’t you told me repeatedly for the past few days that the Paradise Manor’s business and its turnover have been so great? It’s been running for half a year already, yet you’re still short on money?”</p><p>“Hehe…” Ouyang Lulu just laughed at it and said, “You know what? You never managed a household, so you have no idea that daily necessities are quite expensive today! You might earn a lot, but there are tons of times when you must spend it. Besides, above all things, the resort I’m gonna build is five-star, so it’s natural that six months’ earnings won’t be enough for it.”</p><p>Tang Xiu understood quickly and ruminated for a while before he said, “Alright, I’ll take a look at how much money I have left in my account later. But since you want it based on a five-star standard, then build it!”</p><p>“Erm, there’s another thing I want to discuss with you too,” said Ouyang Lulu smilingly.</p><p>“There’s still another?” muttered Tang Xiu with a puzzled face.</p><p>Ouyang Lulu blinked and spoke in a whisper, “Yeah. Can I have debit access to the Everlasting Feast Hall?”</p><p>“Debit access to the Everlasting Feast Hall?” Tang Xiu got more confused and asked, “What for?”</p><p>“I need to cultivate! You also know that cultivation needs resources, while the medicinal pills provided by the Everlasting Feast Hall are so expensive,” said Ouyang Lulu. “Expanding Paradise Manor will make me end up dirt poor for a very long time, and without money, I can only buy the pills on a checking account.”</p><p>Tang Xiu was at a loss whether he should cry or laugh yet again. “If you need medicinal pills, it’s fine if you just tell me directly. Anyway, let’s head inside, shall we? I must treat Yue Li’s mother first. I’ll give you some pills after I’m done, so you don’t need to worry about cultivation resources for the next few years.”</p><p>“Awesome!” Ouyang Lulu was so ecstatic that she pecked Tang Xiu’s neck and kissed his face.</p><p>Not far away from them, two handsome young men were heading towards the parking lot. One of them caught Ouyang Lulu’s action and immediately could not believe his eyes. His face turned nasty when his eyes fell on Tang Xiu.</p><p>“Well, well. Your rival in love has just appeared, Yang Yang.”</p><p>With a smile on the corners of his mouth, Wang Wei shot a squinted look at Yang Yang before he pulled out a cigarette and ignited it, commenting nonchalantly.</p><p>Yang Yang ignored his comment and strode over towards Ouyang Lulu and Tang Xiu who were heading in their direction. He stopped in front of them and questioned in a heavy voice, “Who’s he, Lulu?”</p><p>The smiling and beaming face of Ouyang Lulu immediately receded upon seeing the two of them. It was replaced by a clearly indignant look as she coldly snorted, “Hmph, I told you many times already, Yang Yang. Lulu is not a name you can call out at will—you must call me by my full name! Besides, who he is has nothing to do with you. Just scram far away from me; otherwise, don’t blame me for throwing away any courtesy with you!”</p><p>Yang Yang felt suffocated. He vented out his anger by glaring angrily at Tang Xiu and growled, “I don’t give a damn about who you are. Lulu is a woman I like, so scram from her.”</p><p>“And who are you?” asked Tang Xiu.</p><p>“Who am I?” Yang Yang sneered, “I’m the man you must never provoke! You better realize what you’re capable of and leave, else you’ll face an extremely serious consequence!”</p><p>Tang Xiu burst into laughter at his remark. He shook his head and asked Ouyang Lulu, “From which stone did this thing come out of, Lulu? Is he pursuing you?”</p><p>“He comes from Sichuan; from the Yang House, which is an ancient martial arts clan,” answered Ouyang Lulu. “His mother and my Mom are kinda friends, so I always give him some slack. Otherwise, I’d have driven him away.”</p><p>It was, however, a house Tang Xiu had never heard of, so he said to Yang Yang, “Young man, there’s nothing wrong with young men like us loving belles. But if you got the ability, you should pursue them by yourself. Don’t just run around and threaten others with such a tone. That makes you look like a child. Also, it’s best if you verify the identity of the ones you threaten first. You’ll just invite a calamity to befall upon your family otherwise.”</p><p>Yang Yang’s expression turned nastier. Ouyang Lulu’s remark had already made him vexed, but Tang Xiu’s attitude just added more fuel to the flame. He furiously growled, “Punk, do you know how reckless and blind you are?”</p><p>“Hold it!”</p><p>Wang Wei, who was just standing at the side, reached out to grab Yang Yang’s shoulder. He curiously looked at Tang Xiu and spoke, “Friend, what you just said is correct. He should’ve checked your identity if he wanted to act so arrogant. It would be a very dumb thing that stupid people could do, no? But you see, we’re all young men here, so there’s no need to act with such a disguised mannerism, right? Just tell us who you are.”</p><p>As an answer, Tang Xiu embraced Ouyang Lulu’s waist and lightly smiled, “Well, I’m her man. Isn’t that enough of an identity?”</p><p>“Sigh.” Wang Wei shook his head and sighed, “You’re a young man yourself and should be 21 something, right? But you just called Yang Yang a young man before, so it’s quite laughable to me. Alas, it feels so ludicrous that even you yourself don’t dare to say who you are.”</p><p>“And you are?” asked Tang Xiu.</p><p>“The Wang Family from Singapore,” answered Wang Wei.</p><p>“Ah, a Singaporean Chinese? Your house’s hands can reach China?” asked Tang Xiu curiously.</p><p>“Can it? You need not concern yourself about that, I think.” Wang Wei confidently replied, “But of course, I don’t need to hide my head and wag my tail behind legs like you, afraid to tell your own identity. My family is preparing to invest big in China in the near future to gradually shift our industries. You’ll find my name appearing in the business circle of China soon.”</p><p>“Well, congratulations then,” said Tang Xiu with a smile. “But thanks to your cynicism, I give you my guarantee that your Wang Family’s industries will never return to the mainland. You can wait and see if you don’t believe me.”</p><p>Wang Wei rolled his eyes at it and mocked, “Pfft, who the hell do you think you are, huh? Do you think you represent the policy of a country to push away incoming money? Truly idiotic!”</p><p>Ouyang Lulu looked at him with some sympathy and said, “Everything he said is true. The business strategy of your family will probably fail here. I thought you were much better than Yang Yang before. I really didn’t expect that you’d ruin the chance of your family going back to the mainland just because you want to win him over.”</p><p>Wang Wei was slightly stunned with creased brows. His face turned solemn and he asked Tang Xiu again, “I’m going to ask you again, friend. Who are you, exactly?”</p><p>Tang Xiu didn’t feel like experiencing the bickering of these two fellas anymore, so he directly put his family’s name forward, “Tang Xiu of the Tang Family from Beijing.”</p><p>“Hmph, so you’re the offspring of one of those government officials?” Yang Yang sneered and said, “No wonder you got such a big tone and dare to threaten us. But my house is an ancient martial art clan with a legacy with which your family can never compare to. I give you back your advice. Don’t court disaster to fall upon your family; else, hehe…”</p><p>Tang Xiu’s face turned frosty and he asked with a chilling voice, “Otherwise what?”</p><p>“Else, your Tang Family will suffer heavy losses and your close relatives will become targets for retaliation,” stated Yang Yang coldly. “Don’t think I’m just scaring you. You don’t know how deep my family is. And you, Lulu—you had better make him scram immediately if you want the best for him. You too are well aware of how powerful my family is!”</p><p>“What a moron!” Ouyang Lulu grunted and turned to look at Tang Xiu, “Alright, we gotta talk first. My Mom is like sisters with his mother, so if the Yangs were to be destroyed, his mother will definitely seek shelter with my Mom. Honey, you must keep her alive should you decide to do anything on account of my face, alright?”</p><p>Her request made Tang Xiu between laughter and tears. “Hey, why do you make me like I’m some kind of loony murderous Demon? I won’t wantonly exterminate his entire house just because of this trivial thing!”</p><p>With that said, he took his handset out and dialed Gu Xiaoxue’s number. After his call got picked up, he said, “Investigate the Yang House in Sichuan for me. I dunno anything specific about this family, so Lulu will tell you about it later.”</p><p>“Alright, Grand Master,” replied Gu Xiaoxue respectfully. However, she seemed hesistant before she continued, “Umm, Grand Master, have you… have you have approved… Master as your woman? … just like Miss Xue?”</p><p>Tang Xiu was dumbstruck and stared blankly. He let out a bitter smile and said, “You, girl. You’re still a child, yet you just asked me about such a matter? Just focus on your cultivation.”</p><p>The annoyed voice of Gu Xiaoxue replied, “I’m not a child anymore, Grand Master. I’m much older than you.”</p><p>“You’re just still a toddler in my eyes,” replied Tang Xiu back. He then promptly hung up.</p><p>Yang Yang and Wang Wei exchanged glances as they were keen enough to catch the crucial term—cultivation—from Tang Xiu’s dialog.</p><p>Could it be that… he’s also practicing cultivation art?</p><p>Yang Yang took a deep breath and sneered, “So, if my guess is correct, you should also be someone who has been practicing martial arts; isn’t that right, Mister? I’ve always been regarded as the best talent to cultivate in my House and have been touted as the strongest junior of the youngest generation. How about we have a spar? I won’t bully you; I’ll even let you have a move ahead!”</p><p>“Nah, not interested.” Tang Xiu lightly shook his head.</p><p>Yang Yang’s eyes turned cold. His figure dashed to Tang Xiu’s front in an instant, sending a very fast barrage of punches accompanied with a twisting wind to quickly come in front of Tang Xiu.</p><p>Tang Xiu’s expression slightly changed, as he didn’t expect that this fella would directly attack him. He didn’t even care that Ouyang Lulu was still in his arms.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
