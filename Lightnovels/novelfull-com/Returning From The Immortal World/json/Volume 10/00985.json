Right as they aimed the muzzles at Tang Xiu, however, Tang Guang’s chilling voice sounded, “Put the gun down if you don’t wanna die here. I already told you that your gun is useless and is nothing but a toy in my eyes.”</p><p>“What fucking arrogance!” shouted the black youth.</p><p>A chilling light flashed in Tang Guang’s eyes. The dagger in his hand instantly shot at the guy’s wrist. As the fella’s pistol fell to the floor, the delicate woman bounced up a few times and appeared in front of the seven or so big men as the silver thread in her palm swept at them, directly cutting off their wrists that held their guns, causing their wrists to fall onto the floor along with their pistols.</p><p>In that instant, all the smuggled people inside the cabin were stricken with panic, looking incredulously at Tang Guang and the delicate woman racing hearts.</p><p>At the doorway of the cabin, the lean middle-aged man who constantly looked drowsy suddenly raised his head and indifferently said, “Go fucking outside if you wanna shed blood here. I hate the smell of blood, though I don’t mind the making of bloody scenes.”</p><p>Tang Xiu shot a look at the black guy and his men whining in pain. He shook his head and said, “Let’s stop here and now since the Snakehead Boss already said that he doesn’t like the smell of blood. And you, black dude. I don’t care who you are and what background you have. Just carve in your mind that I’m not one who you can afford to provoke on this ship. Just behave if you still value your life.”</p><p>The black guy glared at Tang Xiu with visible hatred. He gritted his teeth and sat back on the bench. Despite everything, he couldn’t cast away a deep fear in his heart toward Tang Xiu since he was well aware that each of his men was comparable to experts who were able to contend with a group of average people. Yet, they didn’t even have any chance to fight back at all when facing a single man and woman. They had been easily dealt with even after they had pulled their guns out.</p><p>These people were experts and ones that were very powerful.</p><p>The turn of events that evolved to this dramatic outcome was out of Zuo Qing’s expectation. The reason why she spoke out was because of her gratitude to Tang Xiu for giving her children candy and chocolate bars, while she also worried that he would be bullied by these men. However, it never came to her mind that the real ruthless man turned out to be this good-looking and kindhearted young man.</p><p>At this time, she secretly glanced at Tang Xiu, while Tang Xiu himself was keenly aware that she was peeking at him. He just let out a smile towards her and lightly said, “Thank you for the warning. It’s fate that brought us to meet, which was the reason why I protected you and your children.”</p><p>“Thank you,” said Zuo Qing with gratitude.</p><p>Previously, she had been worrying that the process of people smuggling was dangerous. And now, she had witnessed it personally, thus causing her worries to grow deeper, and she even feared that they would encounter an accident on the ship. But her restlessness subsided a lot after hearing Tang Xiu’s words.</p><p>Yet, she couldn’t cast away the familiar feeling she had with Tang Xiu. She felt that she had seen him somewhere, and the thought kept popping up even though she couldn’t remember where from.</p><p>After a long while, she suddenly emboldened herself to look at Tang Xiu and asked, “Do you know someone named Zuo Daquan?”</p><p>Zuo Daquan?</p><p>“No, I don’t know about him.” Tang Xiu shook his head.</p><p>A disappointed expression flashed in Zuo Qing’s eyes. Her father was once a very famous character in China and had extensive connections. If it wasn’t because he had provoked a very powerful family, he wouldn’t have fled from China and lived abroad while hiding their name.</p><p>This time, her husband’s family had been defeated, while her husband died in a strange car accident. Being alone, helpless, and with no one to turn to, her only option was taking her two children back to her father overseas. However, so as to avoid being traced by their enemy while looking for her father abroad, she contacted a few close brothers of her father who could only take her two twin children to enter Saipan illegally. She had to leave Saipan on a smuggling ship to Thailand afterwards.</p><p>Tang Guang, who had returned to Tang Xiu’s side, looked a bit surprised and whispered, “I know about Zuo Daquan and I once met him, Boss. It’s just I don’t know whether he and the man she just mentioned are the same person.”</p><p>“You do?” asked Tang Xiu. “Who exactly is this Zuo Daquan?”</p><p>“He was quite a famous character in the southern provinces some time ago,” answered Tang Guang in a whisper. “Although he didn’t have a direct connection to the highest officials in the country, he was still considered a powerful figure. He’s a businessman, a big one who practically can make money out of anything. But about a decade ago, he had to abandon most of his family’s business and fled abroad because he offended the Huang Family from the Fukang province.”</p><p>The Huang Family?</p><p>A smile appeared on Tang Xiu’s as he inquired again, “Do you know the cause of the conflict?”</p><p>“That I don’t know, but Sis Xiaxue definitely knows about it,” answered Tang Guang.</p><p>Tang Xiu took out his cell phone before remembering that he was at sea right now with no signal. Then, he stood up to walk to Zuo Qing’s side. After sitting cross-legged, he took out two bars of chocolate and handed them over to her as he looked at Zuo Qing and said, “Well, I got nothing to do anyway, so tell me what happened between your old man with the Huang Family.”</p><p>The statement made Zuo Qing’s expression enormously changed. She quickly hugged her two sons with fear in her eyes, saying, “You just said that you never heard of Zuo Daquan? How did you…. how did you know… the matter between him and the Huang?”</p><p>“I have never heard of him, but my subordinate knows something about it,” said Tang Xiu with a smile.</p><p>Zuo Qing shot a look at Tang Guang and asked with hesitation, “Who exactly are you? Are you someone working for the Huang Family?”</p><p>“Please don’t misunderstand me.” Tang Xiu waved and said, “I’m not one of them.”</p><p>The answer made Zuo Qing relaxed, but still very vigilant, “You haven’t answered my first question; who are you?”</p><p>“Well, lemme introduce myself then.” Tang Xiu smiled and answered, “I’m Tang Xiu; that’s the Tang character of the Tang Dynasty, and Xiu meaning cultivating. What’s yours?”</p><p>“My name is Zuo Qing,” replied Zuo Qing. The instant after, a thought suddenly flashed in her mind and a look of disbelief quickly appeared on her face as she exclaimed, “I remember you. You’re the young Divine Doctor Tang Xiu!”</p><p>Tang Xiu couldn’t help but chuckle and said, “Ah, I never thought that I was so famous. To think that I would meet people on a smuggling sea amid the vast ocean that turn out to recognize me.”</p><p>The moment Zuo Qing recognized Tang Xiu, most of the fear in her heart instantly dissipated. Although it was her first-time meeting Tang Xiu in person, she had long heard the resounding reputation of the young Divine Doctor. Most importantly, all the reports about him were positive.</p><p>Thus, she concluded that this young man must be a good person!</p><p>“Are these little guys your sons?” asked Tang Xiu with a smile. “They are cute twin brothers.”</p><p>“Yeah, they are my sons.” Zuo Qing nodded with a bitter face. “Accidents befell my family, and only the three of us have survived. I didn’t expect to meet you here, Divine Doctor Tang. I often heard about your name before.”</p><p>“It’s alright.” Tang Xiu waved and said, “So, tell me about the matter between your father and the Huang! I think you should be very clear about the story from the beginning to end, no?”</p><p>“You already guessed that Zuo Daquan is my father, so I’ll not hide it from you,” whispered Zuo Qing. “It happened 10 years ago; I was less than 20 years old at the time. My father clashed with the Huang from the Fukang province over a business matter, which concluded in the defeat of my father after losing big in their battle. In a rage, my father sent his men to secretly attack Huang Jinfu, the younger brother of the current Huang Family’s Patriarch, and severely wounded him.</p><p>“At first, my father thought that he could handle the Huang by relying on his own ability since they only had power. But it turned out that the Huang Family’s power far surpassed my father’s calculations, thus leading to the deaths or crippling of many of his men, leading to the take over of his business. If he hadn’t of escaped quickly, he would’ve also lost his life by the Huang Family’s hands.”</p><p>“Your father should’ve started his enterprise from the bottom up, right?” asked Tang Xiu suddenly.</p><p>“That’s right. My father was once a poor man coming out of the countryside.” Zuo Qing nodded. “Later on, he relied on his own abilities and amassed hundreds of millions in assets. It was the very reason that he gradually changed and was somewhat arrogant, which eventually led to him provoking people he shouldn’t have.”</p><p>“I see.” Tang Xiu nodded and said, “But this is just a grievance of the past. I think the Huang Family should have forgotten the grudge by now. So, the reason why the three of you are sailing abroad now is to go back to see your father then?”</p><p>“That’s right.” Zuo Qing nodded and said, “My husband passed away after he got in a bizarre car accident, and his family’s business went bankrupt all of a sudden. Although I don’t have any evidence, I guessed that it was because of the hands of the Huang Family. Further, I’m afraid that I will become the next victim of the Huang’s retaliation if I keep staying in the mainland, so my only option is to take my two children and flee overseas. The Huang… are too ruthless. They just simply want none of us to survive.”</p><p>“There’s something that makes me curious, though,” said Tang Xiu. “The Huang knew that you’re in China for more than a decade, so why didn’t they retaliate against you earlier and only act now?”</p><p>“That was because of my husband,” answered Zuo Qing with a helpless face. “He got drunk and then blabbered about our identity. Back then, I attended a boarding school since my father feared that I would become the target of those people who he had offended due to his business. He concealed my existence, so the Huang had been unable to find me until lately.”</p><p>“Haih. It seems that the retribution for the bad deeds that were done by your father in the past now fall on you.” Tang Xiu sighed as he understood the whole story. “Anyway, you’ve already brought your two sons to live abroad, so live your life well! I’ll try to call Huang Jinfu from the Huang Family and hope that he won’t pursue you anymore.”</p><p>“You know the Huang Family’s Patriarch, Huang Jinfu?” asked Zuo Qing with a surprised face.</p><p>“Yeah. I know him.” Tang Xiu nodded.</p><p>The answer made Zuo Qing suddenly restless and nervous. “D-Divine Doctor Tang… you… are you going to tell the Huang where the three of us are heading to?”</p><p>Seeing her anxious and worried face, Tang Xiu let out a light smile and said, “Don’t worry! I rarely meddle in others’ business. Besides, our meeting is preordained by fate and I have a good relationship with the Huang, so I might as well help you in passing! But keep mind to cast away any thoughts of enacting revenge in the future. Forget everything about their relation to the death of your husband or how your family went bankrupt. The Huang are not any average clan you can provoke, lest you stain your children’s hearts with hatred.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
