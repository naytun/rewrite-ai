A black Mercedez-Benz SUV was speeding like a wild horse as it vroomed along the coastal highway amid the roars of its engine.</p><p>However, Tang Xiu, who was sitting in the back seat, was puzzled after seeing that four black Land Rover SUVs were gradually following them from behind, hot on their heels.</p><p>“You want me to deal with those cars, Boss?”</p><p>Spectre sat shotgun in front with a lackadaisical manner. He really looked like he was an entirely different person after he came out of that Chrono Array. He had been unusually cheerful yet very impulsive, more like a reckless and impulsive juvenile punk ever since.</p><p>Tang Xiu shot him a glance and indifferently said, “You should go find some women and get laid if you got time, you know. You got too much impulse inside, so you gotta vent it out well.”</p><p>“Ugh…”</p><p>Spectre’s skittish expression instantly froze, and he looked at Tang Xiu with a dry smile, turning his head directly to look outside through the window while groaning inside: ‘Who the hell said I haven’t found myself some women? Just three days ago, I spoke to six belles and talked about life and ideals, then rolled them up and down on the bed.’</p><p>As for Gu Tao driving the car, his eyes were shining. After he picked up the car’s speed, he looked to the side and said, “Boss, there are four cars in front of us, similar to those behind us.”</p><p>“Park!” ordered Tang Xiu.</p><p>Gu Tao nodded and slowed the car down to park on the roadside. Zhang Jue, who sat beside Tang Xiu, got off fast and turned around to open the door for Tang Xiu and said in a low voice, “There are 16 people in those 8 cars, Boss. They should be martial artists from their appearances.”</p><p>Tang Xiu got off and then lit a cig, smoking it while watching the 16 men come striding from the back and front. His eyes then fell on the man in the lead of the eight men from the front.</p><p>“Hello, Mr. Tang.”</p><p>The man looked young gentle and wore gold-rimmed glasses, carrying a briefcase while donning a very famous brand-name suit which looked fit on him. His expression facing Tang Xiu was unusually respectful.</p><p>Observing him for a while, Tang Xiu then shifted his vision to the rough seas in the distance and spoke indifferently, “You stop me with such a parade on the coastal expressway. Are you coming to pick up some troubles, or are you seeking help? Firstly, let me tell you. Be it picking up troubles or seeking help, I don’t have time for either, so scram at once!”</p><p>The young and gentle-looking middle-aged man said, “We’re neither looking for trouble, nor are we asking for help, Mr. Tang. It was because my Lady wants to see you.”</p><p>“Got no time.”</p><p>He was in a rush to leave for Thailand; how would he have the time and leisure for this Lady?</p><p>Face turned stiff, the middle-aged man immediately let out a dry smile and said, “I’m Sun Bo, the Vice CEO of the Ouyang Group, Mr. Tang. My Lady is on the beach a few kilometers ahead. We naturally don’t dare to stop you if you don’t want to see her, so I’m going back to report to Madame immediately.”</p><p>Someone from Ouyang Group and his Madame?</p><p>A strange look on his face, Tang Xiu asked, “What is she to Ouyang Lulu?”</p><p>“She’s the Young Lady’s mother,” answered the middle-aged man with a smile.</p><p>‘No shit!’</p><p>Tang Xiu cursed inwardly. Had it been someone else, he absolutely didn’t want to bother, but this Lady was Ouyang Lulu’s mother, so his future nominal mother-in-law, no less. No matter how eccentric or flamboyant he ever was, he had no choice but to show his respect regardless! Tang Xiu threw and stomped the cigarette, then forced a smile and said, “Why didn’t you tell me who she was? I wouldn’t have dared to say I won’t see her! Anyway, just give the heads up; why is she looking for me?”</p><p>“I’m just an errand boy, Mr. Tang. How would I know about that?” replied the middle-aged man with a smile. “If anything, you’re the future son-in-law of the Ouyangs, so even if I knew something, I don’t have any room to say anything ahead of time, do I?”</p><p>Cough, cough…</p><p>The reply made Tang Xiu cough a few times. He waved and said, “Alright. Get on the road and show me the way.”</p><p>A few minutes later, the convoy stopped at the edge of the coastal expressway a few kilometers away. As Tang Xiu got off, he saw a woman donned in a white long dress standing on the nearby beach ahead. She stood there with arms crossed behind her back, so Tang Xiu was unable to tell her age. However, he knew that it felt like she was in harmony—perfectly fused with the world.</p><p>‘An expert,’ praised Tang Xiu inwardly. As he came alone behind her, he greeted, “Did you… want to see me?”</p><p>Mu Qinxin turned gently, showing her graceful appearance to Tang Xiu as well as her smiling face. She was Lulu’s resemblance, though a much more matured version. As the bells hanging on her wrist rang, she greeted with her slightly magnetic voice, “It’s our first meeting isn’t it, Tang Xiu?”</p><p>“It’s indeed our first meeting, Auntie,” replied Tang Xiu with a smile. “But you look much younger than I had expected.”</p><p>Mu Qinxin smiled and suddenly lifted her hand. She pointed to the sea and asked, “What do you feel and sense about that?”</p><p>Unable to figure out what kind of thoughts Mu Qinxin had in mind, Tang Xiu zoned out and found himself confused upon hearing such a random topic raised. However, he still answered, “Rivers and tributaries are heading into the ocean. Vast and boundless it may be, it’s filled with peace yet, also full of crisis, for it contains treasure so infinite while being ridden with endless killings and murders.”</p><p>“What else?” asked Mu Qinxin</p><p>‘Anything else?’ Tang Xiu really couldn’t figure out what she was thinking, so he thought for a moment and asked, “What kind of aspect about it are you referring to, exactly?”</p><p>“What is it in your vision? Is it something big, or insignificant?” asked Mu Qinxin with a smile.</p><p>“Man originates from water, while the sea is a vessel of this water.” Tang Xiu shook his head and said, “Whether it is this body of the sea here, or the whole ocean on Earth, it’s just a dot and trivial in my eyes.”</p><p>“Pathetically small and trivial? But can you conquer it?” asked Mu Qinxin.</p><p>With a proud face, Tang Xiu replied, “What I need is time. Give me some time, let alone the sea in front of me, even the whole Earth is nothing but a drop of water in the ocean for me.”</p><p>She nodded and asked again, “If I also want to make the whole Earth just a trivial thing like you, what method do you think I can do to achieve it?”</p><p>It made Tang Xiu instantly realize what she had in mind. Looking at Mu Qinxin’s smiling face, he wryly smiled and took out an ancient manual for cultivation from his interspatial ring, combined with two jade bottles. He then said, “If you can grasp the cultivation technique recorded in this scripture and you’re able to break the shackles of Heavenly Dao, you can then ascend to the Immortal World. Also, there are 20 Essence Amassing Pills in these two bottles. I concocted these auxiliary pills myself with difficulty, so please don’t regard it as some worthless things.”</p><p>Mu Qinxin’s eyes turned bright. She clapped and looked at Tang Xiu, speaking gently, “Lulu truly has good eyes. She’s my precious daughter, though I never thought that I would also profit from being associated with her someday. Tang Xiu. Any descendants have their own luck and blessings, that I know. But I need your promise and commitment.”</p><p>Tang Xiu was silent for a moment and then answered, “For so long as she never lets me down, I’ll also take care of her for eternity.”</p><p>“You’ve passed the test,” said Mu Qinxin, looking satisfied. “But there’s also something else I need to ask from you. If you can give it to me, then you will henceforth be the Ouyang House’s son-in-law.”</p><p>“And, what is this something?” asked Tang Xiu.</p><p>“The zodiac jade carving, any one of them,” answered Mu Qinxin.</p><p>Tang Xiu’s expression changed. Without even a shred of hesitation, he refused, “I’m sorry, I can’t comply. The whole set of jade carvings has 12 pieces. Having one or eleven of them has no purpose, as only the whole set will be of great use for me in the future. Aunt Mu, the zodiac jade carvings are way too important—millions of times more important to me compared to the cultivation technique and medicinal pills I just gave you.”</p><p>Shooting a deep look at Tang Xiu, Mu Qinxin then calmly took the bag on her shoulder, and took out a lifelike red-colored jade dog from the inside. She handed it to Tang Xiu and smilingly said, “I’m afraid that speaking about wealth, the Ouyang House can’t compare to you. I’m also sure that there will be no dowry that can enter your eyes, so I’ll give you this jade dog instead for Lulu’s dowry. What do you think?”</p><p>The jade dog?</p><p>A look of ecstasy burst from Tang Xiu’s eyes. After receiving and affirming that it was one of the twelve zodiac jade carvings, he looked up to look at Mu Qinxin’s faintly smiling face and then seriously said, “This is more than enough, Auntie. Thank you.”</p><p>“I give you the dowry for Lulu, but I still need something from you,” said Mu Qingxin with a smile. “However, I don’t have anything appropriate in mind, though. Lulu’s father likes antiques, artifacts, and relics. Do you have any appropriate item as your token of regards?”</p><p>Tang Xiu ruminated for a while and gently spread out his hand. In an instant, a big Golden Dragon’s head appeared in his hand. Even though the object was very heavy, the weight didn’t apply very much pressure on him. He then said, “What do you think about this Golden Dragon’s head, Auntie?”</p><p>“This one…”</p><p>Mu Qinxin’s heart skipped a beat, daunted. She had heard about the origin of this Golden Dragon’s head and knew that it was a national treasure. There had been bloody storms that happened in the past because of this object. All of a sudden, she didn’t dare to accept it.</p><p>Thinking that Mu Qinxin was not satisfied after looking at her expression, Tang Xiu immediately said, “Alright, if uncle won’t be satisfied with it, then I’ll…”</p><p>Mu Qinxin raised her hand quickly to interrupt him and forced a smile. “That will be enough. It’s just that I was hesitating before. I just thought that it’s too precious and too… too hot to hold.”</p><p>“Hahaha.” Tang Xiu laughed and said, “This Golden Dragon’s head is indeed very precious, but it can’t compare to Lulu in the slightest. Since I’m the one who gifts this object to Uncle, I believe there will be no one who dares to pick up troubles with the Ouyang House, regardless. Besides, you just got a cultivation technique manual yourself, so the Ouyang House’s power will greatly increase in the future, so it’s unlikely you’ll be defeated.”</p><p>She pondered for a moment and felt that Tang Xiu was right. This Golden Dragon’s head may be very precious, but it was of much lesser value compared to the ancient cultivation technique manual. Since she dared to accept the manual, why must she be afraid to accept this object?</p><p>“Alright. Put this object back, Tang Xiu!”</p><p>After Tang Xiu took back the Golden Dragon’s head and was about to speak more, Mu Qinxin took out something and handed it over to Tang Xiu. She then said, “This is a remnant map said to be a treasure map where treasures of legend are buried, though I’m not clear myself of what it is. I’m heading back home and will go into seclusion for a while. I won’t seek any buried treasures again in the future, so I’m gifting this to you! You can look for it later if you’re interested.”</p><p>A remnant map for buried treasure?</p><p>Tang Xiu observed the map made of sheepskin. There were a lot of symbols and patterns on it. His expression changed because he faintly felt that the marked terrain painted on it was rather familiar.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
