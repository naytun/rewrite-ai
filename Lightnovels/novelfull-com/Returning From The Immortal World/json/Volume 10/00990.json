He had encountered the likes of people who acted mysteriously and covered their faces to hide their identities, yet none of them had been as fearful as these guests. After all, these people had the ability to infiltrate his bedroom without being spotted, meaning they had the ability to directly kill him in his sleep.</p><p>More so that many big incidents had happened recently.</p><p>One of which was the destruction of the Darkwind agency branch in Saipan that had secretly claimed all the lives of the agency personnel. Although Saipan’s highest official was said to be the final suspect and mastermind, there was no motive that linked him with it. Furthermore, the confusing fact was that the top official of Saipan had been on vacation, yet didn’t come back alive.</p><p>‘Maybe these people in front of me also have the ability to destroy a regional branch.’</p><p>The thought came to his mind, making him apprehensive yet again. Then, he asked in a deep voice, “To think that you can infiltrate a Darkwind agency location to arrive outside my room without getting spotted at all; you guys are amazingly able. But I still demand your answer. Exactly what is your real purpose in coming here? I don’t buy your reasoning for coming here as to just buy intel since there’s no need to infiltrate this place so secretly, nor would anyone stop you if you openly came here.”</p><p>“You are asking why we came here so secretly?” While pointing to the bronze mask worn on his face, Tang Xiu lightly said, “One is to hide our identities, while second, it’s completely unnecessary if you’re really our enemy since you won’t have any chance to fight back if we really want to kill you. So, is my answer enough proof?”</p><p>This made Charlie fall into silence for a moment. Then, he nodded while waving and ordering the rest. “You guys drawback. None of you are to come here unless I summon you.”</p><p>Dozens of strong men quickly retreated, leaving only the man called Yale, who stood next to Charlie with a vigilant attitude, guarding against any sneak attacks from Tang Xiu’s group.</p><p>“Gentlemen, can you wait for me in the living room first?” asked Charlie. “I’ll immediately come over to see you once I’m done changing my clothes.”</p><p>“No problem.” Tang Xiu nodded</p><p>A few minutes later, after Charlie had changed clothes, he arrived at the reception room. He shot a look at Tang Xiu sitting on the sofa savoring some tea. Then, he smiled and said, “What should I call you Mister?”</p><p>“Call me Tang. He’s Sing,’ answered Tang Xiu lightly.</p><p>Charlie glanced at Singluen and immediately nodded. “Mr. Tang, Mr. Sing, may I know what information you’d like to buy that would even make you visit me so late at night? The Darkwind agency is the largest intelligence agency in the world and we can provide anything of concern worldwide to our buyers. Certainly, Our Bangkok’s branch has the collection of our intel work in the region, which is under my jurisdiction. You can rest assured for the reliability and authenticity of our intel.”</p><p>“I’ve already heard of your agency’s resounding fame.” Tang Xiu nodded and said, “Since Mr. Charlie has spoken about the deal, then I won’t beat around the bush about our purpose either. I need intel about the Dark Shaman clan in this country. In particular, intel on the eldest prince of the Dark Shaman clan, Singkuo. The more detailed it is, the better.”</p><p>Charlie’s complexion shifted. He suddenly shot a look at Singluen and grinned, “Well, I think I know the real identity of this Mr. Sing. If my guess is correct, you should be Young Master Singluen, right?”</p><p>His guess made Singluen’s expression change. He slowly took off the bronze mask on his face and indifferently said, “Your guess is correct. I’m indeed Singluen. I can tell that my big brother has also come here recently to buy intel about me from you. It’s very likely that he wants to know whether I’m already in Bangkok or not.”</p><p>Clap, clap…</p><p>Charlie clapped and applauded as he said, “You’re correct. Your big brother, Mr. Singkuo, has indeed been here to buy intel about you. It’s just unfortunate that we were only able to guess that you had left Bangkok and the country despite how good our intelligence network is. We haven’t been able to figure out where you left from either.”</p><p>“Mr. Charlie, you’ve correctly guessed about the purpose of me and my big brother. But there are things that your Darkwind agency can’t get involved with,” said Singluen. “We came here this time to do nothing but buy intel from you. State your price and we’ll pay you right away.”</p><p>Charlie pondered for a moment and then said, “8 million dollars for the Darkwind agency to sell you this particular intel. It’s worth the price, I think.”</p><p>“Alright.” Singluen took out his cell phone and said, “I’ll transfer the amount directly to your account.”</p><p>However, Tang Xiu stretched his hand to stop him and lightly said, “I think your big brother has been monitoring all your accounts in Thailand. He can quickly find out the flow of cash from your account. 8 million dollars is nothing to me, so I’ll pay for it.”</p><p>With that said, he used his mobile phone to transfer 8 million dollars to Charlie’s account. Then he said, “The money has been sent, so give us the intel, Mr. Charlie! Also, I’m sure your Darkwind agency has an outstanding reputation given the fact that it has become the world’s largest intelligence agency. I’d hate it if you sell us out to others like you just did with Singkuo after we’ve struck a deal.”</p><p>The statement made Charlie look dull before his expression dramatically shifted, causing him to instantly realize that he had already leaked secret information of a customer who bought intel. Further, he never thought that Tang Xiu could actually pinpoint this issue and later point it out to him.</p><p>“It’s a mistake of mine indeed,” said Charlie with a dead-serious expression. “But you can rest assured, the intel about the Dark Shaman clan you just bought won’t be sold again to anyone.”</p><p>Tang Xiu let out a non-committal smile and said again, “Well, your guarantee is nothing but a joke without enough benefits. It’s understandable of course, but I hope you can understand that the ending will be very grim should any outside forces want to get involved in the internal struggle of the Dark Shaman clan just to get more benefits, okay?”</p><p>“The Dark Shaman clan is very special indeed.” Charlie nodded and said, “I understand and have my discretion. I won’t dare get involved.”</p><p>Quickly after, the intel needed by Tang Xiu and Singluen was handed over. After receiving it, they no longer stayed and quickly disappeared into the darkness without passing through the main entrance. Even though Charlie had assigned his men to secretly monitor everything, they were unable to find out how these people left.</p><p>“Sir Charlie,” called out Yale in a low voice behind Charlie while standing in a dark corner near the window and gazing outside.</p><p>Charlie came back to his senses and said in a deep voice, “Track the account used to transfer the money immediately. I want to know who that man is! Also, inform our headquarters that the Dark Shaman clan in Bangkok is currently in an internal struggle. It’s very likely that the struggle will lead to a large-scale battle.”</p><p>“Understood!” replied Yale as he walked toward the outside.</p><p>Charlie stroked his chin as light now gleamed in his eyes. Some powerful people appeared in his mind, yet he was unable to associate any of them with the man who wore the bronze mask just now. Regardless of their age, face, figure, or the terrifying power they had, none of them matched up.</p><p>After half an hour, Yale returned to Charlie’s side and reported, “Sir Charlie, our men have checked it, but the money was transferred from an unregistered Swiss bank account, so we can’t trace the true identity of the other party. Also, I’ve already informed headquarters about this matter as per your order. The reply from HQ is to act according to the circumstances. You can act if it’s profitable, but don’t attract unnecessary troubles for the agency later.”</p><p>Charlie creased his brows deeply and said, “I already expected that the account used by that man would be an unregistered Swiss bank account, yet it never occurred to me that these people would have such a bizarre ability to come and go so freely like that at our own location. It seems like our security measures here are flawed. Yale, rebuild our security surveillance system. Make absolutely sure to cover the whole site so as to make sure nobody is able to infiltrate here so covertly in the future.”</p><p>“Understood! I’ll get it done immediately,” replied Yale as he turned around and left the room.</p><p>Charlie turned around and walked to the table. After pulling out a drawer, he took a black notebook from the inside and quickly flipped through a few pages. He then picked up his mobile phone to dial a certain cell phone number on it. It didn’t take long before his call was picked up and a deep voice asked:</p><p>“What is it?”</p><p>“20 million dollars and I’ll sell you some more intel,” said Charlie with a slightly smiling face. “I’m sure you’ll find this intel of the utmost importance to you.”</p><p>“Got it. I’ll tell my men to transfer it to your account right away.”</p><p>“Then I’ll send the intel to you immediately once I get the money,” said Charlie smilingly.</p><p>Having said that, he hung up and returned back to the sofa to sit down. His expression was that of smugness as he took out a Cuban cigar and happily muttered to himself, “Heh, they can fight all they like, but I’ll fish the money out of them. This Dark Shaman clan may be a bit able and bizarre, but it’s worth to take a bit of risk to make more of a profit. Well, 20 million dollars is worth it for my sweat!”</p><p>“I’m afraid that you won’t have the chance to spend it if you die, though!”</p><p>A faint wind blew all of a sudden, and a chilling voice came from behind Charlie. At the same time, a sharp dagger was placed on his neck. The hand with the dagger only needed a slight motion to leave a deadly wound on Charlie’s neck.</p><p>“W-who are you?”</p><p>Charlie’s body stiffened and his heart chilled in that instant. He rarely encountered such a terrible situation that could make him scared shitless like this. Yet, he was keenly aware that the kiss of death was so close to him at this moment.</p><p>“Well, well, your sweat seems to have earned you quite the fortune in your private account, isn’t that right?” Tang An’s chilling voice spoke again as she came out of the shadow. “I’ll give you a chance to redeem your life. Transfer all the money in your private account into mine. Otherwise, I’ll kill you immediately.”</p><p>“Alright, alright. I’ll transfer it to you,” shouted Charlie hurriedly. “B-but please don’t kill me. I have a lot of money and you can have all of it.”</p><p>“You got a shit ton of money, huh?” Tang An sneered and mocked him. “I’ll still kill you if the number doesn’t satisfy me.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
