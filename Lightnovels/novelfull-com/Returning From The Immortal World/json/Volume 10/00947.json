The appearance of the world’s first hitman, Spectre, had literally birthed endless restlessness inside him. Alloway had arrived and stood beside him silently. The fella could still see the dried-up blood on the floor that hadn’t yet been cleaned up, making him tremble with fear.</p><p>“Boss, Boss Kan has come!”</p><p>A young man with a thin stature sent out a vigorous aura from the outside as he strode fast inside.</p><p>Songzan raised his head and got up, heading to the courtyard gate. As he saw Kanaja with tens of big men in black uniform coming over, he hurriedly paced forward to greet him and called out, “Big Brother.”</p><p>Kanaja shot him an indifferent glance in response. After entering the yard, he directly took a seat on the sofa and asked, “Where’s this Spectre?”</p><p>“He just left,” answered Songzan.</p><p>“Tell me everything!” said Kanaja. “I wanna know why and how did you annoy him or how you provoked the Boss behind him.”</p><p>“I’m not sure about it either.” Songzan shook his head and said, “But I suspect that it’s related to that female star from China.”</p><p>“Tell me the details,” said Kanaja with pressed brows.</p><p>“All this shit is caused by Alloway, Big Brother.” Pointing at Alloway, Songzan said, “He likes that Chinese female star. Her name is Zhang Xinya and has come here to do some commercial filming. Since he covets her beauty and keeps pestering here and got rejected, he also got a lesson from Zhang Xinya’s bodyguards. After I found out that her bodyguards are kind of experts, I sent my men to investigate them. But then, the two men I sent were murdered and I found their dead bodies in the Chao Phraya River. I originally assigned some men to investigate the details of the other party, but then Spectre came bringing the heads of my other two men.”</p><p>“Zhang Xinya?” Kanaja picked his brows and asked again, “Is this the only trouble you’ve caused recently?”</p><p>“It was Alloway who caused this, accurately speaking, Big Brother,” corrected Songzan with a wry smile.</p><p>Complexion turned pale, Alloway knelt before Kanaja and spoke in a shiver, “Godfather, I’ve investigated Zhang Xinya’s background and she’s just a singer in China! Although she brought some bodyguards with her, it’s impossible for her to have anything related to the world’s top hitman, Spectre! P-probably… Spectre’s appearance here… is not… related to this matter.”</p><p>“And, where is this Zhang Xinya now?” asked Kanaja.</p><p>“She’s staying at the five-star Amanda Hotel. I have shares in the said hotel, so I already sent my men to gather the surveillance footage there,” said Alloway.</p><p>“Hmph.” Kanaja coldly hmphed and said, “It seems you’re not too stupid. Tell your men to send the footage here at once after they get it.”</p><p>“Yes, yes, yes.”</p><p>The fella hurriedly took out his cell phone and made a phone call.</p><p>****</p><p>As dusk came, Tang Xiu accompanied Zhang Xinya to the Amanda Hotel’s restaurant. Just as he took a seat at the dining table by the window, Singluen came over. The guy didn’t bring the five old geezers with him and only brought the petite female.</p><p>“Hello, Mr. Tang.” He came before Tang Xiu with a smiling face.</p><p>Responding with a smile, Tang Xiu then said, “Has your big brother come back yet, Singluen?”</p><p>“Not yet.” Singluen shook his head and said, “But I got some good news that he’s going back in two days. He seems to have recruited several experts after he left this time, however. From the intel, it was determined that one of them is Herde, a formidable man who was once a member of the Golden Flame mercenary group.”</p><p>Tang Xiu waved and motioned him to take a seat. Then he lightly smiled and said, “I’m not interested in how many experts Singkuo invited, though. I just hope that he comes back soon.”</p><p>“Hehe.” Singluen chuckled and said, “If anything, I’ll inform you right away the moment he comes back, Mr. Tang. Also, why didn’t you tell me in advance when you left for Thailand? This Hotel is indeed satisfactory, but quite far from my place. I have a beach villa with beautiful scenery. It’d be much more comfortable for you to stay there.”</p><p>“Forget about it for now.” Tang Xiu shook his head and said, “There’s a trivial issue I need to deal with in Bangkok.”</p><p>Singluen zoned out and an angry look appeared on his face after hearing it. “You’re the most distinguished guest of mine, Mr. Tang. Who the hell dares to annoy you in my turf? Tell me who are they. I’ll send my men to deal with it at once!”</p><p>As Tang Xiu was about to reply, he suddenly saw Spectre approaching with hands in his pocket, whereas Gu Tao and Zhang Jue, who were supposed to be standing guard nearby, also came over unnoticeably.</p><p>Something happened!</p><p>After instantly judging the situation, Tang Xiu’s eyes then caught a group of people coming into the dining hall’s gate. With just a glance, he recognized that Songzan was among them as he had seen his photo from Spectre.</p><p>Following Tang Xiu’s line of sight, Singlue also saw the arrival of these people. His expression abruptly changed. As the Young Lord of the Dark Shaman clan, he seldom worked hard to manage the clan’s industries, but he still had his own reliable intel network and personal connections. These people were headed by Kanaja, a man even his father couldn’t ignore.</p><p>‘Is it them who Mr. Tang just said to have annoyed him?’</p><p>He recalled how terrifying Tang Xiu was and his expression when he looked at Kanaja and Songzan turned ugly.</p><p>Walking straight to the dining table where Tang Xiu and Singluen were sitting, Kanaja just gave a Tang Xiu a glance before his eyes landed on Singluen. His slightly overweight body came to a stop as he greeted with a smile, “Ah, I never thought that Young Master Singluen would also be here. It’s been six months since the last time I saw your father. Has he been well?”</p><p>“He’s great,” replied Singluen, brief and apathetic.</p><p>Such hostility from Singluen was keenly felt by Kanaja. Unnoticeable by anyone, his brows creased slightly. His eyes then landed back on Tang Xiu and he smilingly said, “Are you Mr. Tang?”</p><p>Tang Xiu just sat on his chair and didn’t get up, but his eyes were locked on Kanaja before they fell on Songzan, “I recall that I already warned you through Spectre to not annoy me for two days. Yet you didn’t listen. You should be very clear about the consequences.”</p><p>Songzan’s heart pounded and he quickly glanced to his big brother, Kanaja, and then lowered his head fast.</p><p>After speaking, Tang Xiu then shot a look again at Kanaja and said, “It seems your status is higher than his. A man who can make Songzan lower his head and follow in Bangkok should be the Godfather of Bangkok’s underworld forces. You’re Kanaja, aren’t you?”</p><p>“I am!” replied Kanaja with stretched brows, smiling wider.</p><p>“As I reckon, this hotel has a guest reception room on the second floor. Take your men there since I want to dine here first,” said Tang Xiu.</p><p>Kanaja’s expression changed slightly. As an experienced man himself, he was reluctant to recklessly act given that he hadn’t yet figured out Tang Xiu’s identity, so he nodded and said, “Alright. I’ll be waiting for you there, Mr. Tang.”</p><p>As Kanaja and his men left, SIngluen raised his thumb up and praised, “So imposing and domineering, Mr. Tang! You see, Kanaja is a definite Lord of the underground forces in Bangkok indeed. His power might be less than my Dark Shaman clan, but he is not one to be scoffed at either. Yet, I didn’t expect that he’d be careful before you though.”</p><p>Tang Xiu pointed to Spectre at the side whose hands were in his pockets and said with a light smile, “Well, he’s not afraid of me but him.”</p><p>The revelation made Singluen surprised as he observed Spectre and asked with a puzzled face, “And he’s…”</p><p>“I won’t hide it from since we’re friends. He’s Spectre, my man,’ explained Tang Xiu smilingly.</p><p>“Spectre?”</p><p>Singluen still looked puzzled. He faintly felt that the name sounded familiar, but he was unable to recall where he had heard of the name.</p><p>At this moment, the thin stature of a middle-aged man with glasses came over while holding two bottles of wine. He respectfully presented the bottles and said, “Sirs, Ladies, I’m Khan Long, the General Manager of this hotel. My boss asked me to present you these two bottles of wine. He purchased this wine with difficulty from China, in the hopes that it would be able to satisfy you.”</p><p>“God’s Nectar?” a smile showed itself on Zhang Xinya’s face while she sat next to Tang Xiu.</p><p>“My Boss is Songzan, the major shareholder of the hotel,” answered Khan Long.</p><p>“Eh? Haha…” Tang Xiu couldn’t help but laugh and commented, “Does this fella want to lick my boot or something—or, does he want to test me? Hehe… that’s interesting though. Alright. Just put the bottle and go tend to your business.”</p><p>Khan Long frowned, but he still nodded slightly before he turned to leave.</p><p>“Tang Xiu, if they no longer want to look for us for trouble again, let’s just drop it!” said Zhang Xinya in a whisper. “I know you’re powerful and you’re not afraid of these people. But this place is their domain. The less trouble, the better for us.”</p><p>“I know. You can rest your worries.” Tang Xiu smiled.</p><p>The second floor of the Amanda Hotel was partitioned into six conference halls, the best of which was a small reception room more than 100 square meters in size. There, Kanaja quietly sat on a leather sofa with fingers clamping a genuine Cuban cigar while silently ruminating about the issue.</p><p>Ring, ring…</p><p>Suddenly, his cell phone rang twice.</p><p>He took his mobile out. After opening the text and reading the sender’s name, he saw that it was Bai Tao. He opened the phone book and dialed his number.</p><p>“Something up, Kanaja?” a young man’s voice was heard from the phone.</p><p>“I know that we haven’t met for the last few months, Young Master Bai,” said Kanaja with a smile. “How about visiting Bangkok whenever you have some free time later? You see, there are some European and American “canaries” here. I guarantee that they will make you satisfied.”</p><p>“We got a saying here that nobody visits a temple without a reason, Kanaja,” said Bai Tao with a chuckle. “You won’t call just to invite for play time in Bangkok, so there must be something else, right?”</p><p>“Smart, Young Master Bai,” said Kanaja with a smile. “Well, I do have something I wanna ask for calling you. It’s about a person’s identity.”</p><p>“Who?” asked Bai Tao.</p><p>“There’s a singer called Zhang Xinya in your country as far as I know,” said Kanaja. “She’s affiliated with a large entertainment company in China. Additionally, I also found a young man with her here whose name is Tang Xiu. To tell you the truth, one of my men seems to have a misunderstanding with this Tang Xiu. Time doesn’t allow me to fully investigate this young man’s background or identity for now, so might you know anything about this young man?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
