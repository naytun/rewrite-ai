He already figured out this issue. Xue Yu must have set him up with that pigeon and those two big men who trounced him yesterday, completely playing him. He pointed the duo and hissed in rage, “You two actually dare to pit me, you wretched bastards. This Big Daddy will change my surname to yours if I don’t kill you today.”</p><p>“I don’t think that you’re that stupid, though.” Tang Xiu shook his head and smiled. He flipped the menu while shaking his head and smilingly said, “You wanna change your family name to ours? Nope! We dare not agree with the plea! We haven’t planned to have children yet; and there’s no way we must have a son, nor grandson all of a sudden, don’t you think?”</p><p>A cunning look flashed in Xue Yu’s eyes and she cooperated with the play, “I don’t want it either. Besides, if I had a lustful pervert as a son or grandson, I’d definitely choke him to death!”</p><p>Tang Xiu didn’t expect that Xue Yu could say such a vicious strike and glanced at her with a happy smile. He then turned to look at Boss Huang and smilingly said, “Did you hear her? You’re not even qualified to become our offspring, so get the hell out. It’s not a fun sight if you get choked to death here.”</p><p>Boss Huang’s complexion flushed red and shame gleamed in his eyes. His glare at Tang Xiu and Xue Yu was as though he could murder them. He laughed in a fury and said, “Good. Just great. You guys have planted the seed, but just wait. This is not over yet.”</p><p>After saying that, he turned back to his dining table, picking up the briefcase and grabbing a phone on the table, striding away without finishing the dishes.</p><p>Tang Xiu watched his back as he left. He then shook his head and said, “He becoming a business owner actually proves his ability, no matter how mediocre it is. Pity that he has such bad conduct and is driven by his lust—those will give him a bad end in the future. Alright, let’s drop the subject about him, shall we? It’s just a waste of our time.”</p><p>“Got it!” nodded Xue Yu gently with a smile. In her eyes, Tang Xiu was too excellent and too dazzling, so she couldn’t glance at other men anyway.</p><p>As day replaced the night, Tang Xiu and Xue came again to Li Qiang’s house. After Tang Xiu pulled out the silver needles from Li Qiang’s wife, Luo Yu, and checked up on her condition, he let out a happy smile and said, “There’s nothing serious with her anymore. She only needs to rest to convalesce for the next two or three months. I guarantee her health will be the same as a normal healthy person in two-plus months. She must keep taking the herbal medicine in my prescription, however, as its efficacy is not only to nourish the heart but also to treat kidney deficiency and kidney failure.”</p><p>“Brother Tang, can my wife really be like other people in the future?” asked Li Qiang hurriedly. “Then… can she bear a child also?”</p><p>“That’s naturally not a problem,” said Tang Xiu smilingly.</p><p>Li Qiang looked excited and said, “That’s great! We have literally gone everywhere to seek medical help; each place concluded that she hadn’t only had contracted heart disease, but also had problems with the function of her kidney so she couldn’t have a child. Brother Divine Doctor Tang, it’s all thanks to you. Thank you!”</p><p>Tang Xiu waved and said, “Dispense the polite remarks with me. It’s enough for you to push that Boss Huang to the pit and then come to work in my Magnificent Tang Corporation.”</p><p>“I give you my word that I’ll accomplish that,” replied Li Qiang firmly.</p><p>Knock, knock…</p><p>A knock was heard at the door and someone called out from the outside, “Hey, Brother. Are you at home? Please open the door.”</p><p>Li Qiang was in a daze, but he immediately replied with happy surprise, “That’s my younger sister! She’s back.” Striding fast to open the door, he looked at the tall girl standing outside with a beaming smile as he greeted her, “Xinjie! I never thought you would be back this quickly. Hurry up and get inside. We got some honored guests at home.”</p><p>“Honored guests? Who are they?”</p><p>The tall girl smiled in response and moved quickly inside. After she came to the living room and clearly saw Tang Xiu there, she was slightly stunned and called out with incredulity, “Tang Xiu? Why are you at my house?”</p><p>Tang Xiu also looked at who just arrived and likewise showed a strange expression, “Is this your family, Li Xinjie?”</p><p>“Yeah,” answered Li Xinjie.</p><p>Li Qiang and Luo Yu, who sat on the sofa, exchanged a puzzled look. After some time, the former asked with a slightly astonished expression, “You also know my sister, Brother Tang?”</p><p>“Well, we both are students at Shanghai University,” answered Tang Xiu with a light smile.</p><p>“No way, right?” Li Qiang was amazed and said, “Your name is known far and wide as the owner of the Magnificent Tang Corporation, yet you’re still a student of Shanghai University? You… you didn’t just make fun of me, did you?”</p><p>“Tang Xiu didn’t kid you, Brother,” interjected Li Xinjie. “He’s a freshman at Shanghai University like me. We’ll be sophomores after this summer.”</p><p>Tang Xiu also smiled and said, “What’s wrong? I can be the owner of the Magnificent Tang Corporation, but I can’t be a student at Shanghai University? Our forefathers have said that there’s no end to learning. Only by learning more when one is still young will he be able to go further in the future and have greater achievements. This line also needs to be presented to you. You will join Magnificent Tang Corporation in the future; even if you’re a sales expert, you still must work and learn at the same if you want to move fast and climb higher.”</p><p>“Umm, I know.” Li Qiang firmly nodded and replied with all seriousness.</p><p>Li Xinjie, on the other hand, was shocked and asked in surprise, “You just said that my Brother will work for your Magnificent Tang Corporation, Tang Xiu? That reminds me, how did you guys get acquainted? Why did you come to Chang City?”</p><p>The series of the question made Tang Xiu smile and he replied, “There was something I had to do here, and I just happened to meet your brother. He’s definitely a good salesman, so I want him to work for my company.”</p><p>Li Xinjie instantly understood and happily said, “Thanks a bunch, Tang Xiu. I know that my brother is great.”</p><p>Li Qiang let out a hollow laugh in response. He glanced at his wife, Luo Yu, and said hurriedly, “Xinjie, we must thank Brother Tang properly since he has cured your sister-in-law’s heart disease. He’s our family’s great benefactor.”</p><p>Li Xinjie zoned out and immediately said with joy, “Sis’s heart disease has been cured? That’s great! Thank you, Tang Xiu! Thanks a lot. Damn, I should be the one to blame here. I already knew that you’re a famous Divine Doctor, yet I’ve never once asked you to help treat my sister-in-law.”</p><p>“It’s alright, please don’t say any thanks again.” Tang Xiu waved and said, “That’s right. Lemme introduce you to her, Xue Yu. She also is a student at Shanghai University and is Mu Wanying’s roommate.”</p><p>Mu Wanying?</p><p>Xue Yu’s expression slightly changed, yet she concealed the surprised expression on her face.</p><p>Li Xinjie herself had noticed the suffocating beauty of Xue Yu right as she came home. Although she had been suppressing her suspicion and doubt inside her heart, she now realized that Tang Xiu definitely had an extraordinary relationship with this woman named Xue Yu, given how Tang Xiu introduced her.</p><p>“You are…” said Li Xinjie while hesitating.</p><p>Tang Xiu was silent for a moment and said, “She’s my woman.”</p><p>“What did you say? If she’s your woman, then… what about Wanying?” exclaimed Li Xinjie.</p><p>“She knows about her too,” said Tang Xiu.</p><p>Disbelief covered Li Xinjie’s face and she asked incredulously, “Wanying knows her? Does she also know Wanying?”</p><p>Xue Yu stretched her hand out and calmly interjected, “I know Mu Wanying. She’s Tang Xiu’s nominal, true girlfriend, the most beautiful flower of Shanghai University as well as the First Belle of Beijing. She’s also a very outstanding woman.”</p><p>Li Xinjie’s lips squirmed and he couldn’t help but ask, “Then, why are you…”</p><p>Xue Yu calmly cut her off, “What you wanna ask is—why am I still willing to be with Tang Xiu, right? Well, I can answer that. I chose and am willing to be with him, more so that I want to be with him for the rest of my life. I’m not the only one like this, but also his other women know that there’s also Mu Wanying, yet they still are dead set on being with him.”</p><p>“You guys…” Li Xinjie was shocked. She truly couldn’t understand this celestial maiden-like beauty whatsoever.</p><p>Tang Xiu himself didn’t want to engage more in such a topic and remarked, “By the way, I’ve done what I must do, so please remember what I told you. You must pay attention to rest and convalesce in the next two or so months. And keep taking that herbal medicine for three months. We will take our leave since we still have other matters to tend to.”</p><p>Shortly after, Tang Xiu left with Xue Yu.</p><p>Inside the hall, Luo waved and called Li Xinjie to her side. She took her hand and asked, “Xinjie, you seem to be very familiar with Divine Doctor Tang, aren’t you?”</p><p>“How could I possibly be unfamiliar with him, Sis? His true girlfriend is my dormmate and we’re like sisters,” answered Li Xinjie with a forced smile. “It’s just… I didn’t expect him to also have some other women besides Wanying. More so that this woman of his is no worse than Wanying, be it her appearance, stature, or bearings.”</p><p>For a short while, Luo Yu was silent before she shook her head and said, “Xinjie, you must remember that his affairs are his, not ours. Even if you do have a deep friendship with this girl named Mu Wanying, it’s best not to involve yourself in the matter, else you’ll end up the one embarrassed.”</p><p>Li Xinjie nodded without a word.</p><p>****</p><p>The next day.</p><p>Tang Xiu and Xue Yu just checked out of the Chang City Hotel and walked out of the hotel’s entrance. However, Tang Xiu didn’t expect that there were some people with outlandish attire in the vicinity, looking like small gangsters.</p><p>“Trouble comes knocking,” whispered Xue Yu.</p><p>“They might be troubles for others, but it’s nothing much to us,” said Tang Xiu lightly. “Alright, let’s go! We’ll head to the Green Lake Agricola directly. The play we’ll watch should unfold tonight.”</p><p>Creak…</p><p>A Mercedes-Benz offroad-car stopped in front of them. Tang Xiu and Xue Yu directly boarded it. Tang Xiu watched those gangsters in the vicinity move quickly, including their two black SUVs behind them. After watching, he let out a sneer and ordered, “Jin Shi, drive slowly and let those bunches follow us.”</p><p>“Would you like to notice Xue Sha and Hei Xiang in order to deal with them, Boss?” asked Jin Shi.</p><p>“No need.” Tang Xiu shook his head and said, “That man surnamed Huang wants to play now, so we’ll accompany him.”</p><p>A major event was bound to unfold at the Green Lake Agricola. Those who would come to the party should be powerful characters, including some martial art experts. If this Huang guy were to direct his henchmen to rush into the Green Lake Agricola, then a fun yet awkward predicament would unfold for them.</p><p>“You know, Tang Xiu. That smile of yours looks rather insidious and sinister,” said Xue Yu smilingly.</p><p>“Is it? Why don’t I feel it so, though?” asked Tang Xiu with a strange smile.</p><p>“It’s obviously there. I seem to see that Huang pervert having some bad luck soon from your smile,” said Xue Yu smilingly. “There’s something I wanna ask, though. Will cleaning him up now affect your plan? After all, you wish to have Li Qiang work for Magnificent Tang Corporation, to begin with.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
