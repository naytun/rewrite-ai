How can we even have the thought of revenge?” said Zuo Qing with a bitter expression, “All I can ask is to have the hatred of the Huang Family to go away and no longer trouble us.”</p><p>Tang Xiu then looked at the cabin entrance and asked aloud, “Hey, Snakehead Boss. How long does it take to get a signal for a cell phone?”</p><p>The middle-aged man glanced at him and answered, “We’ll reach the midway island for you to change ship in four hours. Only then will you be able to receive a cell signal. However, none of you are allowed to make a phone call.”</p><p>“How about letting me make a phone call, or simply letting me slaughter all of you?” asked Tang Xiu lightly. “It’s your call, though.”</p><p>The man’s eyes narrowed, and he shot a deep look at Tang Xiu for a long time before he silently nodded and spoke out, “Your men are very strong, and we don’t want trouble. But keep in mind that we are never to see each other again once you leave this ship.”</p><p>“You’ve got my word.” Tang Xiu nodded.</p><p>Time passed by and noon of the next day of the journey quickly came in the blink of an eye. After a day of sailing, the cargo ship smoothly arrived in Manila. Now with a signal, Tang Xiu dialed the phone number of Huang Jinfu, the Huang Family’s Head, in front of Zuo Qing.</p><p>“Hello, Mr. Tang,” a pleasantly surprised voice belonging to Huang Jingfu came out of the phone.</p><p>“Have you been well, Family Head Huang?” asked Tang Xiu with a smile.</p><p>“It’s not bad, thanks.” Huang Jinfu replied with a happy voice, “Well, is there anything I can do for you since you’ve contacted me, Mr. Tang?”</p><p>“Yeah, I’d like to ask a favor from you,” said Tang Xiu with a smile.</p><p>“Please tell me directly, Mr. Tang. As long as it’s within my means… or what the Huang can achieve, we’ll definitely try our best,” replied Huang Jinfu hurriedly.</p><p>“It’s about Zuo Daquan; you should know about him,” said Tang Xiu. “I and his daughter, Zuo Qing, have a bit of a relationship, so I learned about the animosity between you both and I want to be the peacemaker. Anyway, the grudge from the past has been kept far too long, right, Huang Jinfu? Can you consider letting it go?”</p><p>The question made Huang Jinful fall into silence for a while before his wry voice replied back, “If it is your wish, then my family will pursue it no longer, Mr. Tang. Though I’m afraid that I can’t suppress my younger brother on this matter.”</p><p>“As I heard it, your younger brother was injured in the past. How’s his condition now?” asked Tang Xiu.</p><p>“He stayed in bed for more than a decade, and is said to be crippled for the rest of his life,” answered Huang Jinfu with a bitter voice. “If it wasn’t for the great effort by my family to sustain his life with medication, he wouldn’t have been able to survive.</p><p>“Anyway, I’m currently overseas, but I’ll find time to visit your younger brother once I return,” said Tang Xiu. “I’ll deal with his disability problem!”</p><p>“If you can cure my younger brother, ah… no, no, no. I talked too much. With Mr. Tang’s great medical skills, I don’t think any symptoms are outside of your ability,” said Huang Jinfu excitedly. “I’ll prepare lavish gifts for you after you return to the mainland and visit my younger brother’s home.”</p><p>“I’ll visit for his treatment, but there’s no need for any gifts. Well, there’s nothing else to speak about, so see you later.”</p><p>Tang Xiu directly hung up after he said that. He had his phone on speakerphone while talking with Huang Jinfu, so Zuo Qing was able to hear the conversation.</p><p>At this moment, despite the shock she had due to Tang Xiu’s ability to make the Head of the Huang Family of Fukang province act so respectful, the most intense feeling she had was the joy that the Huang would write off their grudge over the years and would no longer send their men to pursue her family.</p><p>“Thank you, Divine Doctor Tang. Thank you,” said Zuo Qing wholeheartedly.</p><p>“Nevermind it. It’s just a minor matter and easy to deal with.” Tang Xiu waved and said, “Let’s go outside. We’re going to change the ship for the journey ahead.”</p><p>Zuo Qing grabbed the two children’s hands and followed Tang Xiu to board another cargo ship. Just as she sat on the cabin, she asked, “Do you mind giving me your number, Divine Doctor Tang? Although my father fled to Thailand many years ago, he has developed a business again from scratch after many years. You’ve enormously helped us, and I’m sure that he’ll be very grateful to you as well. Also, if you have no place to stay at in Thailand, you can stay at my father’s manor. I guarantee you that it has a very good environment there.”</p><p>A manor?</p><p>“What business does your father do in Thailand now, though?” asked Tang Xiu curiously.</p><p>“He has a lot of businesses, but he lives at a coconut plantation now,” answered Zuo Qing with a smile. “It’s August now, the ripening season for coconut. If you come with me there, you can taste the most delicious coconut meat and milk.”</p><p>“Is it located in Bangkok?” asked Tang Xiu.</p><p>“It’s in the Bangkok suburbs, about an hour’s drive from downtown,” answered Zuo Qing.</p><p>Tang Xiu gave it some thought for a short time before nodding, “If so, then I will bother you with a visit. But there’s a very important matter I need to deal with in Thailand this time, so the whereabouts of me and my men must be kept a secret.”</p><p>“I understand that. You wouldn’t have boarded a smuggling ship otherwise given your identity.” Zuo Qing nodded and said, “Well, I’ll call my father after the ship is docked so he can send his men to pick us up.”</p><p>“You give something to others, and you’ll get something else in return,” commented Tang Xiu smilingly, “The line seems to hold true. I didn’t expect to earn myself some temporary lodging due to helping others on a whim.”</p><p>“Haha.” Zuo Qing chuckled and said, “You’re hailed as a Young Divine Doctor in China, a figure respected by tens of thousands of people. It should be our pleasure and honor for being able to help you.”</p><p>“Let’s spare the pleasantries. We’re setting sail soon, so take your time to quickly have a meal and rest well.” Tang Xiu waved and said, “Nobody knows what’s going to happen next, but the most important thing is to keep your spirit in the best condition possible.”</p><p>On the long river that divided the land, more than 100 kilometers away from downtown Bangkok was a suburb with large plantations and estates belonging to many wealthy landowners.</p><p>In a large manor estate in a strategic location with convenient transportation, Zuo Daquan, who was wearing a flowery coat and a necklace with an ivory pendant, was standing by the pool before a multi-storied building, a look of worry evident on his square face.</p><p>“We still have no news, Boss,” reported a stalwart youth that came striding from the distance.</p><p>“Huya and Shezi still haven’t sent any news either?” asked Zuo Daquan with knitted brows. “Do you mean the journey arranged by Snakehead to smuggle them has been compromised?”</p><p>“Something came up and Feifei has met with a mishap,” said the young man with a bitter face. “He seems to have offended a powerful clan and got dumped into the sea. We lost contact with him and we were unable to get in touch with Snakehead at the midway point either. However, both Huya and Shezi have mobilized men to find the young lady’s traces. Worry not, boss. I’ll inform you immediately once we find their trace.”</p><p>“Are you all so fucking trash that can’t even get things done?” growled Zuo Daquan angrily. “Just remember that if my daughter and two grandsons encounter any danger, you will bear all the consequences.”</p><p>“Understood!” nodded the youth quickly.</p><p>Taking out a cigar, Zuo Daquan lit it up and took a deep puff twice before sighing, “That child Little Qing has never enjoyed a happy life with me. She spent her early life in a boarding school and sometimes was only able to see me every six months. Right as she grew up, I offended someone and escaped from the mainland. When I saw her life finally stabilize, I never thought that what I had done would catch up with her. The damn Huang Family… I’d have already returned to the mainland and exterminated them if I had the ability to do so.”</p><p>“The Huang have a deep foundation, as well as a lot of experts working for them,” said the young man hurriedly. “Just limiting ourselves from their investigation is already a very tall order, so please cast away any thoughts of revenge, Boss.”</p><p>“Blame me for being very impulsive in the past, causing me to clash against the Huang clansmen directly. It’s just that they have never let me go even after I fled overseas,” said Zuo Daquan with a helpless face. “Do you think I don’t know how powerful the Huang is? They are determined to get us and don’t want to drop this matter at all.”</p><p>The youth fell into silence as he was aware that Zao Daquan was speaking the truth. His boss would’ve already let go of the grudge and would bury the hatchet if he could, yet the fact of the matter was that the younger brother of Huang Jingfu, the Head of the Huang Family, ended up with a lifelong disability. Him being alive until now was already a miracle in of itself. Even if they wanted to cast away the animosity, the Huang probably wouldn’t let it go just like that.</p><p>“Forget it. I’ve done my best for any means to defend against them regardless.” Zuo Daquan waved with an irritated expression, saying, “The Huang are very powerful in the Fukang province, and they have quite the power in China. But I don’t believe that they can extend their hands in Thailand and Bangkok. Just continue tracking the whereabouts of Qing’er. Be ready to go and send reinforcements once you find her.”</p><p>“Affirmative!” replied the youth as he turned and walked away.</p><p>Zuo Daquan kept smoking the cigar while standing by the pool and silently praying: Nothing must happen to you and your two sons, Qing’er! Else, in the future, I will only live my life in pain.</p><p>As the next day came, a cargo ship docked on the shore near the Chao Phraya River. A few stealthy men came ashore and had a talk with the port official and, quickly after, the forty-plus smuggled people on the ship left in a hurry. Tang Xiu didn’t allow Zuo Qing to contact her father, but instead ordered Tang Guang to catch some taxis to head toward the address Zuo Qing told him.</p><p>“We got company tailing us, Boss,” whispered Tang Guang all of a sudden.</p><p>Tang Xiu instantly released his spiritual sense. There was indeed a black SUV trailing behind them. Further, some of the men in the car were the black youth’s subordinates who were also passengers on the smuggler ship.</p><p>“Deal with them, An.”</p><p>With his perception, it was easy for Tang Xiu to find Tang An who had been on the car’s roof this whole time to give the order to.</p><p>CRASH</p><p>A loud crashing sound was heard, and the black SUV behind them suddenly overturned and crashed into the store on the side of the street, causing several men in the car to be seriously injured.</p><p>Less than two hours later, three taxis then stopped before the gate of a manor. Four security guards in black uniforms then quickly came out with batons in their hands as Tang Xiu and the rest got out from the cabs.</p><p>“Who are you?” asked a man in Thai.</p><p>Zuo Qing was apparently very fluent in Thai, so she paced forward while holding the hands of her two sons, saying, “I’m Zuo Qing; Zuo Daquan is my father. I need to trouble you with notifying him that I’ve come with my two sons!”</p><p>“You’re the Young Lady?” exclaimed the security guard with a bright smile and lit up eyes.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
