He didn’t understand what Tang Xiu did to this man previously, but after he learned of Tang Xiu’s real identity from Tang Yunde, only then did he come to a realization that Tang Xiu’s actions were like those scenes in martial arts movies when some experts imparted their abilities to others, causing the cultivation of the imparted person to improve by leaps and bounds in a short period of time.</p><p>“Are you really sure you got stronger, Tom?”</p><p>“Absolutely.” Tom Reggie heavily nodded and said, “I tested it right after I took a shower. The max weight I used to able to lift was 100kg, but now I can lift or move a 200kg object.”</p><p>This made Song Guanghui shocked, and the way he looked at Tang Xiu was entirely different than before. What Tang Xiu did to create an expert in just 10 minutes was simply like a scene in a movie. It also proved that he was truly powerful.</p><p>In the case… that if… Tang Xiu could help him open the passages of his meridians, could he also have the strength to move several hundred kilogram objects?</p><p>Eagerness and enthusiasm were boundless in Song Guanghui’s eyes as he looked at Tang Xiu and asked, “Tang Xiu, I’ve always been a soldier myself, and I always revered combat prowess and strength ever since I was small. Even though I’ve left the army for more than 2 decades, I never neglected my kung fu, and even hired grandmaster-level martial artists to teach me martial arts.”</p><p>Tang Xiu immediately understood what Song Guanghui wanted, but this kind of steroid-like cultivation enhancement was never a good thing. For instance, Tom Reggie. His power indeed progressed rapidly now, yet he’d have a shaky foundation that would make his achievements limited and progress to be more difficult. Even if he were to consume massive cultivation resources, he would hardly be able to reach the Golden Core Stage, while reaching the Nascent Soul Stage was nothing but a dream.</p><p>“Please don’t be in a rush, Uncle Song.” Tang Xiu waved and said, “I just helped Tom to upgrade his strength which made me consume quite a lot of energy. Besides, I’ve been traveling all day today and I still must leave for Nine Dragons Island soon. The urgent issue there is quite tricky to deal with, so let us talk about helping you later.”</p><p>Song Guanghui was silent for a while. Then he slowly nodded and said, “Alright, we’ll see to it later since you say so! Anyways, do you want me to send you there with a special plane?”</p><p>Tang Xiu seemed moved but he shook head and said, “There’s no need, Uncle. I already contacted my men on the island. A chopper will come to fetch me.”</p><p>“Alright, then.” Song Guanghui then got off the couch and said, “Also, I already gave you my number, so just call me anytime whenever you have anything that needs my help. I won’t come with you to Nine Dragons Island, though. Just remember to contact me once you come back and visit my home.”</p><p>“Will do,” replied Tang Xiu.</p><p>Soon after, Tang Xiu and Tom Reggie walked Song Guanghui outside. At this moment, as the dim dawn of the sun came rising from the East, the helicopter from Nine Dragons Island arrived. After it landed on the helipad of Lao Bay Resort, Tang Xiu led Zhang Xinya, Spectre, Gu Tao, and Zhang Jue to board the helicopter. Right at this time, however, Tang Xiu received a call from Mo Awu that his team also had arrived in Saipan and were now on the way to Lao Bay Resort.</p><p>“Tom, lend me one of your resort’s choppers! Awu’s team has arrived here too and we’ll leave for Nine Dragons Island together.”</p><p>With a changed expression, Tom Reggie replied, “Copy that. The chopper is ready to take off at a moment’s notice. But how many people are there in Awu’s team?”</p><p>“There should be four of them,” answered Tang Xiu.</p><p>“Only four? Then I’m coming there too!” said Tom Reggie hurriedly. “Long Zhengyu called me before about it, so I’m going to go there to take a look at the situation as well.”</p><p>“Alright, let’s go together then.” Tang Xiu nodded and added. “But don’t take too many people with you!”</p><p>“Roger that!”</p><p>****</p><p>At eight in the morning, the two helicopters arrived at Nine Dragons Island. After they landed on the helipad, Mo Awu and Long Zhengyu ran over along with four other men.</p><p>“Tell me the current situation!”</p><p>Tang Xiu had just seen the reconstruction work on Nine Dragons Island from above. After extensive renovations, the plan had been finished and the building complexes had now been built in clusters in different areas, whereas the greeneries on the island had also been improved. Series of intricate roads and pathways had been built in all directions, connecting the buildings all over the island.</p><p>Aside from that, the nine extended slopes were still unchanged and were now surrounded by guardrails. The areas apparently became restricted spots on the island. All cargo ships, yachts, liners, and other vessels were orderly moored at the two re-established ports with a large number of armed personnel guarding them. There were even several newly built lighthouses and water beacons.</p><p>“We have investigated the identity of those six teenagers, Boss,” reported Mo Awu in a deep voice. “They’re all Singaporean Chinese and members of an ancient and mysterious sect which fled China around 50 years ago and re-established itself in Singapore. Those two old geezers, however, are very hostile to us. Although they temporarily gave up their intention to destroy the buildings on the island, they still are occupying the hilltop and refuse to leave.”</p><p>“Any other specific information about this ancient sect, like its name?” asked Tang Xiu.</p><p>“Haven’t asked them about that; those six young men are reluctant to say more.” Mo Awen shook his head and said, “They seem to be afraid of us, I think. Although we have provided them all with accommodations, they didn’t even try them and instead just use the rations they brought with them.”</p><p>Tang Xiu nodded in response. As he came to the stone bridge, he took a seat in the car that came to transport him. As the car turned and went towards the palace, he asked again, “How about our casualties?”</p><p>“Two men killed, six severely injured, and more than a dozen with minor injuries,” answered Mo Awen. “Wolf Head is also seriously injured and is now recuperating in the palace.”</p><p>The news made Tang Xiu’s eyes gleam with frosty light. He looked through the windows to the outside at one person and suddenly said, “She’s Zhang Xinya, my woman.”</p><p>“Madame!” Mo Awen’s mind shifted and he hurriedly called out.</p><p>Zhang Xinya already knew that Tang Xiu had bought this Nine Dragon Island. Yet, she was still shocked by the scene she saw here since she realized that the budget needed to fully finish such a construction project for the whole island would be stratospherically high. More so that there were not only many ships of various types, but also a lot of airplanes. This place simply looked like a private armed base.</p><p>Additionally, she didn’t expect that the island would also have a majestic palace aside from other various buildings. She even found that many men armed to the teeth were stationed near the stone bridge.</p><p>“Hello there.”</p><p>The address Mo Awen just used to call her made Zhang Xinya happy, so she smilingly replied with a nod.</p><p>“Xinya, Awen and Awu are brothers. This island is ours, so you can regard this place like your own home in the future,” said Tang Xiu.</p><p>“It’s too big for a home, you know. It’s like a garden city and stunningly beautiful.” Zhang Xinya chuckled.</p><p>“Relax. This place is my private territory and not under the jurisdiction of any country,” said Tang Xiu with a smile. “You just need to remember that you’re the lady of the house here.”</p><p>“Alrighty!” Zhang Xinya nodded firmly.</p><p>Soon after, the convoy arrived at the gate of the palace. While still in the car, Tang Xiu saw Mu Qingping standing while holding Gu Yin’s hand at the entrance. They obviously had been waiting for a long time.</p><p>“Yinyin dear!”</p><p>After he got out of the car, he walked toward Mu Qingping and Gu Yin while opening his arms.</p><p>With melodious laughter, Gu Yin moved like a graceful dancing butterfly as she plunged herself into Tang Xiu’s embrace and kissed him on the cheek, excitedly saying, “It’s been half a year since Yinyin last saw you, Master. I missed so you much.”</p><p>“Master missed you so much too, Yinyin.” Tang Xiu smiled and said, “So, how have you been here? Happy and getting used to being here?”</p><p>“Yeah, Yinyin already has gotten used to this place. I love this island,” answered Yinyin with a smile.</p><p>“That’s great.” Tang Xiu smilingly said, “Have you been well too, Sis Mu?”</p><p>“Everything’s been great, Mr. Tang,” replied Mu Qingping with a nod and a beaming face. “There’s nothing much to do with Awen and the rest of the men here.”</p><p>Tang Xiu nodded in response and then introduced Zhang Xinya to Mu Qingping. Then he said, “Sis Mu, please take Xinya and settle her first. Awen and I will tend to some things first.”</p><p>“I’ll arrange everything for Miss Zhang, Mr. Tang. But please do pay attention to your safety,” said Mu Qingping hurriedly. “Those people who just landed on the island are very powerful.”</p><p>“No worries!” Tang Xiu said, “They are not people that I need to pay precaution to.”</p><p>A short while after, Tang Xiu looked around and said, “Awen, send someone to bring those six little guys to the place where those two geezers are. In the meantime, we’re going ahead to see the situation first. I want to see how good their abilities are since they’ve dared to come to my Nine Dragons Island to make trouble.”</p><p>Mo Awen complied and waved to his men to carry out the order before taking Tang Xiu into the car. More than a dozen cars then quickly moved further inland on the island. Ten minutes later, the convoy stopped in front of a building halfway up the hilltop.</p><p>“The car can only travel up to here. Though it’s not too far, we need to hike up to the top, Boss,” said Mo Awen. “We can get to the hilltop in ten minutes at the most”</p><p>Tang Xiu nodded as an answer and led his men to hike up to the hilltop. On a nearby boulder, he saw two old men in black robes with unkempt hair and grey and aged complexions. In their hands were diamond-studded staffs, and their faces were covered by totem tattoos, making them look particularly ghastly and grim.</p><p>Aside from them, there were also two long giant pythons that were over 5-meters long and as thick as a bucket, hissing and slithering around the boulder. The two pythons stopped in front of the boulder as Tang Xiu’s group approached and stared at them with chilling eyes, seemingly ready to attack at a moment’s notice.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
