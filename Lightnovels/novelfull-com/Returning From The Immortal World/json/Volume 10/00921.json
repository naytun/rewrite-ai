He naturally wouldn’t care about the life and death of several humans. Yet, whether it was in his past or current life, he abhorred the massacre of ordinary people or the outrageous wanton killing of the weak.</p><p>The Devils.</p><p>It was the title coined for such people in the Immortal World; countless people with a sense of justice would quickly hunt and kill them. The Lian Family needed to kill innumerable people just to refine this Nine Fetuses of a Hundred Ghosts Streamer. He couldn’t care less if they did that by killing their enemies. But the situation he just witnessed was seeing them wanting to kill everyone in the entire Green Lake Agricola, torture them, and then devour their souls to ultimately turn them into resentful spirits. This deed was absolutely something the likes of those Devils would do!</p><p>Tang Xiu watched the furious face of Lian Wentian and coldly hummed, ” <em>Hmph</em> , I wanna know something. Are all members of the Lian Family involved in refining this Ghost device?”</p><p>“I don’t know what Ghost device you’re talking about,” growled Lian Tian angrily. “If you’re talking about this Nine Fetuses of a Hundred Ghosts Streamer, I tell you that you only snatched one of them. There are a total of 9 streamers controlled by the nine strongest members of the Lian Family. If you dare to be an enemy of my family, you’ll face the wrath of my family’s experts!”</p><p>Nine?</p><p>Tang Xiu’s pupils contracted and his killing intent skyrocketed instantly. The divine sword instantly appeared in his hand and shot forward like a meteor, directly hacking Lian Wentian into two halves as he roared, “KILL ALL MEMBERS OF THE LIAN FAMILY HERE!”</p><p>“Affirmative!”</p><p>Mo Awu, Jin Shi, Xue Sha, and Hei Xiong instantly attacked. Their strength was ten times stronger than that of the Lian Family’s members. They were simply like tigers that raged over a flock of sheep. Under the horrified gazes of Song Donglai, Ao Wei, and their men, everyone from the Lian Family was killed in less than half a minute.</p><p>Tens of meters away from the scene, behind the window of a building, the hiding place of Boss Huang and Li Qiang was tucked away. The former couldn’t help but show his hatred when he saw Tang Xiu appear. However…</p><p>“HEAVEN! How is this possible?!!”</p><p>Boss Huang was violently trembling. He felt as though his heart was bitten by a viper, creating deep fear in his whole being. Never once did he ever dream that the man—his personal enemy who he so aggressively hunted with his men—would turn out to be this terrifying. More so that…. among each of the men under him, which one of them was a normal person?</p><p>They… they were simply a bunch of Killing Gods!</p><p>Li Qiang narrowed his eyes. Although he was likewise shocked with the fighting and killings here today, and also shaken by the terrifying strength of Tang Xiu and his men, he never forgot about his mission. After he noticed how frightened Boss Huang was, he immediately grabbed his arm and consoled him in a low voice, “Don’t worry, Boss. I’ll protect you no matter what happens.”</p><p>Boss Huang’s lips squirmed a few times and he pressed his voice to reply, “You? Protecting me? Why would you do that? Do you think you can be those killing fiends? I… I have a grudge with that murderous punk!”</p><p>Li Qiang pretended to be alarmed and frightened, and replied with a trembling voice, “W-what… what did you say? Do you have a conflict with Tang Xiu? Damn… this is bad, so damn dead! He’s a murderous fiend, a devil! Many people know that although he is called by everyone in the country the Young Divine Doctor, he’s also known as one who abhors evils like his enemy! B-Boss… how did you offend him?”</p><p>“Young Divine Doctor?”</p><p>Boss Huang gawked and was stunned. He suddenly slumped to the floor with a look of wanting to cry, though no tears could come out. “I’m so dead! It’s all over! No wonder I felt that he looked familiar back then. It turns out that he’s the Young Divine Doctor Tang Xiu! I’m so damned, Goddammit! How the hell did I provoke the Big Boss of the Magnificent Tang Corporation, Tang Xiu?”</p><p>Yet, a medicine to cure regret did not exist to buy in this world. Otherwise, Boss Huang would have been willing to buy such regret reversal medicine even if he had to spend his property. He knew who Tang Xiu was; he had a distant relative who lived in the Shuangqing Province who used to have a famous big family in Star City, but his family was eventually destroyed under various forces invited by Tang Xiu.</p><p>Li Qiang himself didn’t know such a situation. He just remembered what Tang Xiu had tasked him with. His expression kept fluctuating and he grabbed Boss Huang’s hand much stronger as he said sternly, “Boss, I already chose to be your underling. I’m not afraid even if he’s a lunatic murderous fiend. Even if I have to die today, I’ll die in front of you.”</p><p>Boss Huang turned his head with disbelief and saw his firm expression. He suddenly felt warm and touched inwardly.</p><p>“Thanks. That’s mean a lot.”</p><p>“Things might not have reached the worst, Boss.” Li Qiang shook his head and said, “This Green Lake Agricola belongs to my cousin, and you can also see the situation outside. My cousin and those Lians are enemies, while Tang Xiu brought his men to annihilate the latter, right? You also know that the enemy of our enemy is our friend, no? My cousin is there and I’m sure Tang Xiu will give him face.”</p><p>Boss Huang was as though seeing a life-saving straw to clutch onto. He hurriedly grabbed Li Qiang’s hand and said with a quick breath, “Li Qiang, Young Brother Qiang. If your older brother can leave here alive, then everything will rely on you. But you can rest assured that I will never forget this kindness. I guarantee that your life will be rich and full of honor when you follow me in the future.”</p><p>Li Qiang heavily nodded and said, “I naturally choose to follow you, Boss. In fact, I already decided to sell you my life. I’ve done quite well mixing in the world for so many years, yet I’ve also tasted the ficklenesses of people who have a change in mind and feeling. Nobody cares about me because of my abilities. Even my peers always pushed me out when I worked in several companies before. It was all because of my excellent performances, even causing me to get threatened by my Boss’s relatives, who then eventually drove me away. It was only you—only you who saw my capability. Not only did you sign the sales contract so I could earn some money for my wife’s treatment, but you also let me work in your company. This Li Qiang will never forget this kindness and trust.”</p><p>The way Boss Huang looked at Li Qiang changed after hearing it. He finally understood why Li Qiang refused to abandon him even though the situation was very dangerous.</p><p>Originally, he thought that it was his value that made Li Qiang feel thankful to him, albeit there were many factors involved. However, this young brother turned out to be a passionate and righteous man!</p><p>Inside the pavilion.</p><p>Song Donglai and Ao We came to Tang Xiu. With eyes full of joy and excitement, Song Donglai respectfully said, “Thank you, Mr. Tang!”</p><p>“You don’t need to thank me.” Tang Xiu shook his head and said, “Those who commit heavy sins are doomed to destruction, to begin with. The Lian Family has been using extremely cruel methods to refine the Nine Fetuses of a Hundred Ghosts Streamer, and it’s my duty to neutralize them due to their diabolic deeds. If I found you committing some evil deeds in the future, I’ll also be the one who’ll kill you personally.”</p><p>“You have a magnanimous and benevolent heart, Mr. Tang,” said Song Donglai sincerely. “I’ll definitely cast myself away from doing such atrocious and despicable deeds. Yet, I have to say that if you didn’t intervene today, I’m afraid that we’d have been killed by those Lian Family’s experts and completely annihilated. We will forever remember this gratitude. Feel free to call us if you have any need of our assistance in the future.”</p><p>Tang Xiu couldn’t help but chuckle. He didn’t refute him and asked, “Do you know where the Lian Family lives?”</p><p>“Ning City of Haiqing Province,” answered Song Donglai.</p><p>Tang Xiu nodded at his answer. He then flipped his hand to take out an ancient scripture containing a cultivation technique and threw it to Song Donglai, “Now tell me. How many of you want to cultivate?”</p><p>Song Donglai stared blankly, shocked by Tang Xiu’s action of taking out the manual out of thin air. After he opened and read the manual, however, ecstasy suddenly appeared on his face immediately., “Four… no, two.”</p><p>Tang Xiu turned to glance around and asked again, “Two of you all have died?”</p><p>Only after hearing these words did the ecstatic expression that covered Song Donglai’s face recede, replaced with a bit of a pained expression. He then nodded and said, “Gong Quan died and… Han Sen, who we invited, might be unable to survive either.”</p><p>Tang Xiu’s gaze then shifted to Han Sen, whose body was shaking yet never toppled over. He then asked him all of a sudden, “If I give you a chance to survive, would you say goodbye to them?”</p><p>At this time, Han Sen was drowning in dizziness. But he tried hard to listen to Tang Xiu when he was still conscious. He was a man who was both good and evil, and everything he had done always depended on his mood when he conducted himself in society; hence, he didn’t like Tang Xiu’s benign principle, who tried to never offend anybody.</p><p>“I… cough, cough… I only have tomorrow to face… no… nothing I have… in the past…”</p><p>Tang Xiu squinted and turned to ask Song Donglai, “What does he mean?”</p><p>“Brother Han is a rebel, the traitor of his Han Family.” Song Donglai forced a smile and said, “…He… he’s always seen as the alien of the family and so was driven out by his family many years ago. Ao Wei told me that he has always been a lone wolf.”</p><p>Tang Xiu instantly understood. His figure suddenly flashed and instantly appeared in front of Han Sen. A jade bottle containing Holy Healing medicine appeared in his hand as he poured one pill from the inside, stuffing it into Han Sen’s mouth and saying, “If I’m not mistaken, your heart has been pierced and your injuries are quite fatal. But I’ll give you your life back, though your life belongs to me from now on.”</p><p>Han Sen just sneered in response. He was perfectly aware of what kind of situation he was in at present. Even if Bian Que reborn, or Hua Tuo came back to life, they probably wouldn’t be able to save him. Therefore, Tang Xiu’s statement to him was simply…</p><p>“What?”</p><p>The sneer on his face abruptly froze. The Holy Healing pill was just stuffed in his mouth for several seconds, but it had turned into a strong current that flowed down his throat and into his chest and stomach, before finally transforming into countless hot streams that swept across his whole body.</p><p>“Now sit cross-legged and circulate your True Qi according to your previous cultivation technique,” said Tang Xin with a deep voice.</p><p>Han Sen’s body was trembling and he sat cross-legged without hesitation.</p><p>Tang Xiu then looked at Song Donglai and lightly said, “Since Gong Quan is dead, there are only you and Ao Wei left who need this cultivation technique. But keep my word in mind. Memorize the content of this cultivation technique and immediately burn the manual later. You both can cultivate it, but you are not allowed to pass it to anyone without my permission! Otherwise, I can bestow you your strength, but I also can take it back. I’ll contact you if there’s something I need you to do in the future.</p><p>Song Donglai and Ao Wei exchanged glances and the duo respectfully said, “Please rest assured. We’ll never pass it along to anyone.”</p><p>Tang Xiu nodded at their promise. He then waved to Xue Yu, who had sprinted down the hill and was now standing tens of meters away. Then he spoke again, “The matter here is over, and the enmity between you and the Lians have been solved as well. Cultivate well later since I’m hoping that I can see you become stronger in the future.”</p><p>“Mr. Tang, the Lians have lost many men here; even their Patriarch and two ancestors died,” said Song Donglai hesitantly. “The enmity and blood feud between us and them has probably gone deeper. I believe that they will soon…”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
