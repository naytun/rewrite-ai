He was a martial art grandmaster of his generation that even other martial art grandmasters had to be respectful of and reverent upon seeing him; yet, how could he even be taunted and sneered at by this young man?</p><p>However, he was also aware that Tang Xiu was right. He indeed had his blood running cold, alarmed and afraid. It was because from the clash with that guy, whether it was strength or speed, that man was better than him. He wouldn’t have believed that the guy was that strong had it not been the aching sensation of his internal organs and the uncomfortable feeling in his chest. It was impossible for that man to be this strong, even if he had been practicing since he was in his mother’s womb.</p><p>“Who is he?” The old man deeply looked at Jin Shi before he turned his head and asked.</p><p>“Does it make sense to you to have such a question now?” asked Tang Xiu lightly. “People said that powerful dragons can never suppress local snakes, but I never believed this false saying. Your Zhang Family is indeed very strong in Macao, but there’s no need to exert all of my power to suppress you here.”</p><p>Whoosh, whoosh…</p><p>As his voice faded away, Jin Shi’s figure flashed again and instantly stormed toward the old man. Xue Sha also followed suit as he appeared in front of Zhang Wendi instantly, along with a Mitsubishi army knife that appeared out of thin air in his hand, its tip slashed toward the latter’s throat.</p><p>“STOP!”</p><p>Two middle-aged men rushed out of the crowd, one of whom who dashed lightning fast to the front of Zhang; the other fended off Xue Sha from the side.</p><p>Bam, bam, bam…</p><p>The Zhangs’ old man was barraged with dozens of punches and his old body was flung backwards like a fallen leaf. The two middle-aged men, however, all had fresh blood dripping from their shocking wounds all over their bodies. They had been barely able to avoid their vital parts from being injured while protecting Zhang Wendi.</p><p>“Alright; it’s enough.”</p><p>Tang Xiu took out a half-pack of cigarettes. He ignited one and threw the rest to Singluen. He came to the Zhangs this time to solve the problem, not for a massacre.</p><p>Jin Shi no longer attacked and went straight behind Tang Xiu, whereas Xue Sha pursed his lips and seemed to be unsatisfied as he commented, “Boss, let’s just straightly exterminate all these rookies and annihilate the Zhangs directly. Besides, in the past, we often rooted out all sources of the problems.”</p><p>“Do your annihilation and rooting out desires abroad, but never make trouble for me at home,” said Tang Xiu with a cold face.</p><p>“Ugh… got it, Boss,” replied Xue Sha with embarrassment as he shuffled back a few steps and no longer talked. Meanwhile, Jin Shi and the rest let out strange and awkward laughter towards him.</p><p>Tang Xiu looked at Zhang Wendi who was ghastly pale and with fear on his face. He then said lightly, “You see, one must have enough capital to act arrogantly. You act arrogant before me and so does your family, which is very stupid in my eyes. My father is a softhearted and kindhearted man since he doesn’t want to lose all decency with your family. But I’m different from him. You all just annoyed and provoked the hell out of me, while I only need a nod to annihilate your family thoroughly. Thus, I’ll give you three minutes to make your Patriarch appear before me. If he doesn’t come out within three minutes, then none of you should appear here.”</p><p>Zhang Wendi glanced at the three elders of his family and finally realized how terrifying Tang Xiu was. He didn’t even think as he shouted, “I’ll inform and ask my grandpa to come here!”</p><p>“No need.”</p><p>Zhang Pinqin, who was surrounded by more than ten members of the Zhangs, entered the pavilion. His pupils suddenly shrunk when he had taken a clear look of the situation inside. He then strode quickly to the severely wounded old man, propping him up and asking, “Are you alright, Second Brother?”</p><p>The old man shook his head and forced a bitter smile, “I’m heavily injured, but its not fatal. They’re too strong, Big Brother.”</p><p>Zhang Pinqin turned to look at Tang Xiu and spoke in a heavy tone, “You’re Tang Xiu of the Tang Family, yes? Are you relying on your wealthy and powerful family to come here and bully my family?”</p><p>“You got that right!” said Tang Xiu lightly. “I come to bully your Zhang Family, so what do you guys wanna do to me? I’ll keep entertaining you if you wanna play around still.”</p><p>“You…”</p><p>Little did Zhang Pinqin expect that Tang Xiu was so arrogant. However, he knew the strength of his Second Brother and his two nephews, yet they had been badly injured just now, evidence that the opponent was much stronger.</p><p>“Don’t use ‘you’ to me, will you?” said Tang Xiu lightly. “If anything, I didn’t have a plan to slaughter your Zhang Family during my visit here. Yet, you dared to threaten us, so I won’t let this matter go. Now tell me, how does your family plan to pay the collateral?”</p><p>“You want me to pay compensation?” Zhang Pinqin was shaken inwardly as he asked, “What do you mean?”</p><p>“Hmph, your family wants those two ports, but they are my father and Uncle Chen’s industry,” sneered Tang Xiu grimly. “Now think for yourself, aren’t you, the Zhangs, quite unbridled here? You’ve traumatized us, so isn’t it proper to demand some compensation for the mental and spiritual damages?”</p><p>Meanwhile, Chen Anhu, who had just been shocked by the fierce battle, now looked at Tang Xiu wearing an indifferent expression before him. Only then did he finally realize why his brother, Tang Yunde, wanted his son to come over. It was because there were a lot of powerhouses around his son!</p><p>Yet, he also recalled how powerful the Zhangs in Macao were, so he finally began talking his piece with a bitter smile, “You can spare the compensation for mental damages, Tang Xiu. We can let it go as long as they no longer have the thoughts to snatch those two ports.”</p><p>“Is that so?” commented Tang Xiu with a faint smile that didn’t quite seem like one.</p><p>Zhang Pinqin, on the other hand, looked at the meek Kutu who was standing in silence nearby. He then spoke to him in a low voice, “Kutu, my family is not only the only one who wants those two ports, but also your Dark Shaman clan. What’s wrong with you now? They are now picking my family to bully us, yet you’re just watching in silence like that?”</p><p>Kutu glanced at Singluen and he let a hollow smile and said, “Patriarch Zhang, we may be allies, but the Second Young Master of the clan is here, so I have no room to have any say.”</p><p>The Second Young Master of the Dark Shaman clan? That Singluen?</p><p>Zhang Pinqin glanced at the crowd and his eyes finally landed on the said guy.</p><p>“I’m just a hatchet man hired by Mr. Tang Xiu now,” said Singluen apathetically. “Whoever dares to cross him will have to face me. Your Zhang Family may have allied with the Dark Shaman clan, but you’re not my ally. Therefore, I do hope that your family lowers your guard before me, or else…”</p><p>“You dare to go against your own Dark Shaman Patriarch, Singluen?” shouted Zhang Pinqin angrily.</p><p>With that said, he grabbed his mobile phone to call the Patriarch of the Dark Shaman clan, Krida.</p><p>“Have you thought about it clearly, Patriarch Zhang?” interjected Tang Xiu with a faint smile. “Once you call it out, it’s tantamount to tear all the decorum with me. I don’t know if your family can afford to bear the consequences.”</p><p>Zhang Pinqin’s expression turned stiff instantly and his fingers hung above the dial button. He eventually didn’t press it and turned to look at Tang Xiu, speaking in a deep voice, “You want my family to bow down to you, but that will have to wait until you can beat the most powerful expert of my family first. But I must tell you one thing in advance. The ancestor of the Zhangs has been living for 206 years and has reached the acme of perfection in his cultivation—even those the likes of martial art grandmasters are nothing but ants before him.”</p><p>“So, your family will comply with any condition I put forward if we can beat your ancestor then?” asked Tang Xiu smilingly.</p><p>Disdain gleamed inside Zhang Pinqin’s eyes as he proudly replied, “That’s right. If you can defeat the most powerful forefather of the Zhangs, my family will be univocally unhesitant to even cede our territory as compensation.”</p><p>“Big Brother!” the heavily injured old man hurriedly called out.</p><p>Zhang Pinqin raised his hand and sneered, “You need not say more. Our family may have our blood bleeding out and heads severed, but we will never be humiliated!”</p><p>Clap, clap…</p><p>Tang Xiu applauded and sighed. “The Zhang Family’s Patriarch is truly a brave man indeed. Alright then, I’ll accept your condition to let your forefather appear! You can have my word that as long as we lose, not only will we immediately leave the House of Zhang, but we will also compensate you. Whether you want money or those two ports, we’ll have them offered to you immediately.”</p><p>At the side, Chen Anhu’s expression drastically changed and he interjected quickly, “Tang Xiu, this is…”</p><p>Tang Xiu raised his hand to interrupt him and indifferently said, “Uncle Chen, please let me handle this issue if you trust me. You’re the brother of my father’s and I’ll never let you suffer any losses no matter what the outcome is.”</p><p>Chen Anhu’s complexion changed and he looked indignant as he retorted loudly, “What the hell are you spitting out? I’m your father’s brother, so my things are also his. Do whatever you see fit since you’ve made up your mind. Worse comes to worst, the compensation is nothing but those two ports.”</p><p>Tang Xiu happily nodded at his response. He then looked at Mo Awu and said, “You are to go on the stage to entertain him next.”</p><p>“Understood!” nodded Mo Awu respectfully.</p><p>Ten minutes later, a bald old man in a white track suit came in from the outside. He had a thin stature, yet his eyes were full of spirit. His eyes fell on Mo Awu’s group when he entered the pavilion.</p><p>“This is interesting. Truly interesting,” muttered the old man as he continued, “It’s been centuries without seeing an interesting event like this. I originally thought that nobody apart from those famous extraordinary people would dare to propose a fight with me in this world, so I never thought that I would actually run into some bold baby dolls today.”</p><p>A smile climbed up the corner of Tang Xiu’s mouth as he watched the old man and said, “Well, well. I never thought that the ancestor of the Zhang Family would turn out to be endowed with extraordinary talent. To think that you’ve ascended from the martial path into the Dao. You have even entered the Foundation Establishment Stage, the one with the highest achievement on the path of martial arts I’ve encountered so far.”</p><p>The old man’s countenance became extraordinarily dignified. He looked at Tang Xiu and asked, “You also know the Foundation Establishment Stage? Who exactly are you?”</p><p>“Oh, please. Please don’t put on such a strange face and remark just because you’re ignorant, will you?” said Tang Xiu lightly. “You just need to know that you gotta put a restraint on your family if you’re defeated later—don’t let them be frogs who only know to view the sky from the bottom of a well, yet still act domineering and arrogant.”</p><p>“Hmph, I can’t tell how powerful you are, but it’s pointless trying to be a hero with your mouth,” snorted the old man coldly. “Just bring it on and let me see your strength.”</p><p>“Just relying on you?” talked Tang Xiu back smilingly. “You don’t have the qualifications to make me show anything. Awu, entertain him.”</p><p>Mo Awu strode forward and surged his aura out. He cupped his fist over and said, “My Boss has commanded it, so I can’t directly kill you. Then, I can only entertain you according to the rules of a sparring match. Old fellow, don’t blame me for not reminding you. Give me everything you got, else you’ll completely lose your prestige of having that old face if you lose.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
