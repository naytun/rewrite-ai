He could easily tell that Mo Awu erupted an aura that was stronger than what he could muster. The oppressive feeling brought by his momentum forced him to cast away his previous contempt.</p><p>“You must still hold the virtue of respecting the old and cherishing the young, young man.”</p><p>As his voice faded away, he turned into a shadow and flashed towards Mo Awu with dozens of fist strikes that were swiftly delivered in just a second.</p><p>BOOM…</p><p>The dull clashes of punches made the majority of the onlookers slightly change in expression. Chen Anhu was the most shocked as he was once one of the top special commandos in China. He had gone through hails of bullets and storms of fire and water, blazing through the path of killings, encountering many experts an unknown number of times. Nevertheless, he had never encountered such terrible existences like these people; they were much more powerful than the martial art grandmasters he saw in movies.</p><p>A few seconds later, Zhang Hongding staggered seven steps backwards with green veins protruding on his old face. His eyes gleamed with disbelief while the gray coat on his chest was torn, a mark of a palm clearly printed on his chest.</p><p>Mo Awu retracted and composed his aura back while looking at Zhang Hongding contemptuously. He then came to Tang Xiu immediately and respectfully reported, “This old guy has lost, Boss.”</p><p>Tang Xiu nodded with satisfaction and gently flicked his fingers. As Mo Awu retreated to the side, he calmly said, “So, how was it? Do you think it’s still necessary to go further than that?”</p><p>Zhang Hongding shook his head with an astringent face. He just had a blow with Mo Awu. The clash had been only several seconds. The others might not be able to see the crux of the issue, but he was perfectly clear that he had lost—and even badly at that. If Mo Awu just wanted to kill him, he would have had at least several chances to do so.</p><p>“I lost,” Zhang Hongding watched Mo Awu with a complex expression, then turned to Tang Xiu as he sighed, “Sigh, this old man admits to have completely lost. Please state your purpose of coming to my Zhang House, young man!”</p><p>Tang Xiu got up and clapped his hands, then smiled, “You admit your defeat, so things will be much easier now. So, Patriarch Zhang, can I still count on your word?”</p><p>There was shame in Zhang Pinqin’s eyes when he coldly replied, “Choosing to gamble means that I dare to pay the losses as well. State your conditions.”</p><p>A cold expression covered Tang Xiu’s face as he replied in a heavy voice, “From now henceforth, the Zhangs are forbidden to have any thoughts on those ports. Additionally, you will transfer at least two other ports you own within three days to compensate the mental damages Uncle Chen has gone through.”</p><p>“You have my word,” replied Zhang Pinqin while clenching his fists.</p><p>Tang Xiu scornfully sneered, “I only will take two ports from you this time. But all of you Zhang guys had better remember my words. Ask me clearly first before you do your machinations involving the people I care about. I don’t care if you provoke others, but if you do that to my people, then I’ll destroy your whole family.”</p><p>Just as his voice faded away, a surge of aura blasted out from him along with the appearance of a longsword in his hand, causing numerous people in the courtyard feel suffocated by the pressure. Tang Xiu brandished that sword toward the three-story European-styled pavilion in the north.</p><p>The sword qi flashed unhindered with a rainbow-like sword beam.</p><p>The stylish European-style pavilion instantly split in half before it rumbled and collapsed, sending a mist of dust into the air.</p><p>Hiss…</p><p>A cold gasp was let out by Zhang Hongding, the ancestor of the Zhangs. He shuddered violently while his eyes watched Tang Xiu with a look of fear.</p><p>That aura… and that strength…</p><p>It was so obvious to him, making him realize that Tang Xiu’s accomplishment in martial arts was at least several realms higher than his. This young man was highly likely to be a cultivator himself, even at least at the stage of Golden Core. It came to him that if it were Tang Xiu who clashed with him a while ago, a slap from him could have killed him easily.</p><p>The shocks and horrified expressions of the Zhang Family’s members made Tang Xiu feel satisfied as it meant that he had achieved his purpose to set up his might and prestige to them. Therefore, he didn’t feel like staying any longer. He then looked at Kutu coming from Thailand and indifferently said, “Go back to Thailand earlier and pass my message to your Dark Shaman Patriarch: ‘I’ll come to visit your clan a few days from now’.”</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Despite being a powerful shaman, Kutu didn’t dare to be disrespectful before Tang Xiu. The longsword Tang Xiu had just showcased sent a chill down his spine and he was perfectly aware that he was absolutely not Tang Xiu’s opponent, not even his Patriarch.</p><p>On the way back, Chen Anhu felt like he was dreaming. The difficult problem that had plagued his mind recently had been resolved by Tang Xiu so easily. More so that he never thought that he could even snatch two more ports from the Zhangs. It must be noted that those two ports occupied by the Zhangs were very good places which would be a great boon to expand the scale of his business and earn a fortune.</p><p>“By the way, Tang Xiu, can you tell me whether this Uncle Chen of yours can be as powerful as you?” Chen Anhu couldn’t help but ask as he looked at Tang Xiu beside him who closed his eyes and didn’t speak.</p><p>“If you were 20 years younger, maybe there would be hope for you, Uncle Chen,” Tang Xiu shook his head and smilingly replied. “But now there is not, though you can cultivate some cultivation techniques to strengthen your body and can prolong your lifespan. If you want it, I’ll stay in your place for a day and impart you with something.”</p><p>It was a happy surprise for Chen Anhu and he excitedly replied, “Good, great! You’re welcome to my place!”</p><p>Tang Xiu smiled at his response and turned to look outside the window.</p><p>Macao had a very good environment and he also liked it here, especially its sunny beach. It made him suddenly recall the dream he had of going to school and seeing the sunny beach on TV. It was a dream that he could play there someday.</p><p>‘Haha, I was so naïve back then, wasn’t I…’</p><p>Tang Xiu inwardly laughed at himself. Just as he was about to retract his vision back, his expression suddenly changed and, in almost a flash, he pushed the door open and dashed out.</p><p>“Stop and park the car quickly!” Chen Anhu, who sat beside him, was like a blind man that was unable to react, and instantly shouted when he saw the seat next to him became empty and he looked at the door that opened and closed. His anxiousness shot up to the roof.</p><p>He truly couldn’t figure why Tang Xiu was looking for his own death. What exactly happened? The car was travelling at least at 100 km/hour, yet he just dashed out like that?</p><p>Creak…</p><p>The car braked and stopped at the roadside quickly as Chen Anhu hastily leaned to the seat Tang Xiu just sat in and looked out the window. But he was dumbfounded when he saw Tang Xiu dashing like he was flying towards the beach not far away. He was just like those kung fu masters in the martial world in the movies.</p><p>‘Over there?’</p><p>About two kilometers away were more than ten young people in outlandish attire surrounding two young men in the middle. The duo had bloody noses and swollen faces with bloodstains on the corners of their mouths. It was obvious that they had been badly beaten. The duo was Yue Kai and Hu Qingsong who had just come to Macao for a fun trip.</p><p>“Call and fucking ask your family to prepare the money. 100,000 yuan and not a penny less; otherwise, this Big Daddy will take your limbs off,” loudly shouted the red bleached-hair youth with earrings and a needle piercing the corner of his lips. He was remarkably like the stereotype of a delinquent gangster with his baseball bat arrogantly pointed at the duo.</p><p>“Puah…”</p><p>Hu Qingsong spat out a mouthful of blood and saliva. He ferociously glared at the red-haired youth and growled, “I got no money and only one life. Just chop my fucking limbs off if you got balls!”</p><p>Yue Kai struggled to get up from the ground and grabbed Hu Qingsong’s arm. He hurriedly called out, “Don’t show off, Old Hu. And you, Big Bro, we were in the wrong and we admit that, but we didn’t know that those two belles were yours. 100,000 yuan is way too much for us. Let alone us alone, but even our families are probably unable to afford it. Do you see this? I got 50,000 yuan here and we’ll immediately make a phone call and try our best to immediately give you the rest of the 50,000 soon.”</p><p>“Hey, Yue Kai, why did you have to bow down to this bunch of punks?” scowled Hu Qingsong, “They just messed with this Daddy, yet you wanna fucking drag me from paying it back…”</p><p>“Are you finished yet?” interrupted Yue Kai as he angrily shouted back, “A man knows better than to fight if the odds are against him. Don’t you get it? They can fight even though they only have a few people. If you can fuck all of them up, then keep showing off. But if not, then shut up!”</p><p>“I…” Hu Qingsong opened his mouth but eventually flung his face to the side.</p><p>He was good at brawling himself and a few ruffians were usually not his match. But this time, he was hitting a solid iron board. These guys obviously practiced martial arts. They may be dressed up outlandishly, yet they were good at punching and kicking. At the very least, he didn’t have the confidence to knock one of them if he were to fight all of them alone.</p><p>While enduring aches all over his body, Yue Kai grabbed his mobile phone and thought for a second before he found a number and dialed it.</p><p>Ring, ring, ring…</p><p>A ringtone of a mobile sounded, making Yue Kai blank out because the sound came from someone’s handset nearby. He thought that it was a coincidence and turned his head to look towards the direction of the ringing phone, only to have disbelief cover his bloody nose and a swollen face.</p><p>“Tang… Big Bro Tang?” Yue Kai rubbed his eyes hard and thought that he was just seeing things.</p><p>Tang Xiu was standing several meters away from the group of people, already had taken out a cigarette and lit it up. He had fully heard all the threats toward Yue Kai and Hu Qingsong from these people. When everyone’s attention was garnered at him, Tang Xiu slowly walked over and witnessed his two buddies with bruised faces and blood on the corner of their mouths. It made him angry, yet his face didn’t flinch at all and remained smiling.</p><p>“You two got some fun time, didn’t you?”</p><p>After determining that the one who came was truly Tang Xiu, Yue Kai finally called out ecstatically, “Boss Tang! How are you here?”</p><p>“You came here yourself, so why can’t I be here?” replied Tang Xiu. “Anyway, what happened to you? Are you two coming here to play, or did you just get kidnapped or something?”</p><p>Meanwhile, Hu Qingsong looked embarrassed after seeing clearly that it was Tang Xiu. With eyes full of shame, he wished that could find a burrow to bury himself into. His lips squirmed a few times upon hearing Tang Xiu’s inquiry, but he bit the bullet and said, “We made a trip to have some fun here, Big Bro Tang, yet we got set up by this bunch of wretched punks!”</p><p>“So, tell me then. How did they set you up?” asked Tang Xiu with a smile.</p><p>The red-haired youth raised the baseball bat in his hand and pointed it at Tang Xiu while strangely smirking, “Wow, Big Bro, Boss Tang, huh? You turn out to be the Big Bro of these two boys? Did you come here to send the money, or do you wanna get beaten together with them?</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
