They were perfectly aware of the incoming huge gamble they were about to take, and what success or failure signified to them.</p><p>If they were to succeed, they would become carps that leaped through the dragon gate and soared to the sky, though a failure would send them straight to the path of no return to head to the Netherworld.</p><p>Just at the moment when the trio was about to discuss the details, the box’s door was knocked again. The bald stocky man came in and quickly came to Song Donglai and whispered, “Boss, the Liu Family’s Head, Liu Pinxin, and the crippled old lady of the Lius are here now. Manager Wang just informed me about it. They went to see that young man surnamed Tang in the VIP box.”</p><p>“What?” Song Donglai was shaken with disbelief in his eyes. He knew very well the influence and power of the Liu Family in Chang City. Nobody in the entire city dared to provoke the Lius. They were simply a giant here. It was needless to say that about the Liu Family’s Head, though that crippled old lady was much more horrifying than the entire Liu Family itself.</p><p>And yet… why did they come over to visit his Green Lake Agricola? Was it just because of that young man surnamed Tang?</p><p>Ao Wei and Gong Quan stood up with eyes gleaming. The former then said in a deep voice, “With such an elderly visiting, we should go to greet her.”</p><p>“That’s right. Although she’s not a member of our Occult Sect, she has a deep friendship with a lot of elders in the sect—A great personage we must look up to, so greeting her with respect is a must.”</p><p>The duo’s eyes were very bright, but there was also surprise in them.</p><p>Song Donglai expression changed and he suddenly said, “Do you think it would be more beneficial than harmful for us to bring the Liu Family into our plan, or the other way around?”</p><p>“How much do you know about the old lady of the Liu Family?” asked Ao Wei.</p><p>“Not much, even though I’ve been in this city for decades.” Song Donglai shook his head and said, “But I know the Liu Family’s Head, Liu Pinxin, quite well though.”</p><p>“Tell us about him,” said Ao Wei.</p><p>“Liu Pinxin is a man of big ambition,” said Song Donglai. “He can be said to be a very resourceful person; he only makes moves after mature deliberation, but I suspect that he’s also very strong.”</p><p>Ao Wei was ruminating for a while before he nodded and said, “Let’s meet him first then. We’ll decide the rest depending on the situation. But if we eventually want to pull his family, I’m afraid the odds of him agreeing with our plan is very slim. No, let’s drop the idea so as not to cause new problems to crop up and complicate things.”</p><p>With that said, he took a seat again, apparently giving up on the idea of meeting the Liu Family’s ancestress.</p><p>Song Donglai nodded without speaking. Then he said, “If that is the case, then I’ll go see them first. Also, I gotta ask them what background this boy surnamed Tang has. The fact that he can make the Liu Family’s Head and their ancestress come at the same time is rather intriguing.”</p><p>Ao Wei and Gong Quan nodded in unison. They too were curious as to who this great personage could be that was able to make the Liu Family’s Patriarch and ancestress come for him.</p><p>Two minutes later, under the lead of the stocky bald man, Song Donglai came to the front of Zhang Shi and Liu Pinxin right as they came out of the box. He then spoke with a face full of respect, “I didn’t know that Elderly and Patriarch Liu came to visit, so I didn’t greet you. Please forgive me.”</p><p>“And you are?” asked Yang Shi, surprised.</p><p>Liu Pinxin knew Song Donglai, so he smiled and said, “He’s Song Donglai, the owner of this Green Lake Agricola, Mother. I called him before to arrange the box for Divine Doctor Tang.”</p><p>Yang Shi instantly understood and she nodded with a smile. “I’m pleased to see you, Boss Song. Your hospitality towards Divine Doctor Tang is quite satisfactory.”</p><p>Song Donglai’s expression changed and he asked hurriedly, “He’s Divine Doctor Tang?”</p><p>“You actually didn’t know the famous Young Divine Doctor Tang, Boss Song?” asked back Liu Pinxin with a smile. “He has a very famous reputation and he’s also my Liu Family’s honored guest.”</p><p>The Young Divine Doctor? Tang Xiu?!</p><p>Song Donglai zoned out and his pupils shrunk all of a sudden. Waves of panic burst inside his heart. His body violently trembled and he paced back two steps in an instant with a ghastly pale face. He remembered that this Young Divine Doctor Tang also had another identity—a very terrifying cultivator, who had once killed a lot of people of the Occult Sect in Kanas. He was also the fiendish Killing God who sent his henchmen to root out many families under Occult Sect.</p><p>‘Heaven! Haven’t I just treated him coldly?’</p><p>‘I’m dead! So dead! I hope he has a big heart and doesn’t care about it. Otherwise, I can never escape even if I have 100 lives.’</p><p>Song Donglai’s lips squirmed a few times and dense sweat drilled their ways out of his forehead. He then difficultly spoke, “A-are you really sure that he’s the famous Young Divine Doctor Tang Xiu in the Chinese medicine circle?”</p><p>Yang Shi and Liu Pinxin exchanged glances. They both could see the strangeness in Song Donglai’s mannerism. The latter then asked with a puzzled expression, “Boss Song, looking at your face, why do you seem very afraid of Divine Doctor Tang? He’s indeed the Young Divine Doctor Tang Xiu and the Big Boss of the Magnificent Tang Corporation.”</p><p>Song Donglai reached out to prop himself on the wall while squeezing out a smile that was uglier than crying. He then tremblingly muttered, “I’m dead. I didn’t recognize him just now and even held some contempt while looking down on him when I received him. I… I would be very miserable if he harbors some resentment towards me.”</p><p>Liu Pinxin smiled and said, “I don’t think you should worry about that, Boss Song. Even though this is my first time meeting him, I got quite a grasp on his character. Divine Doctor Tang is a broad-minded, genial and kind man. He won’t be angry because you don’t pay much attention to him. There’s no way he would do anything unfriendly towards you.”</p><p>Kind and gentle?</p><p>Song Donglai suppressed his fear and said with an astringent face, “Patriarch Liu, if Divine Doctor Tang is truly kind-hearted and genial, I wouldn’t be so scared stiff like this. But in the eyes of the Occult Sect’s people like me, he… he’s literally a fiendish Grim Reaper—a living Evil Star.”</p><p>Liu Pinxin was startled and turned around, but found his mother was also surprised. He then immediately asked with a curious face, “What exactly happened? How come Divine Doctor Tang has such an ominous title?”</p><p>Song Donglai looked around. After he found that nobody around was paying attention to them, he suppressed his voice and bitterly said, “Don’t tell me you both haven’t heard of the big incident that happened in the Occult Sect six months ago? A lot of members from many families were massacred, including a lot of powerhouses passing away in the incident. It was all because of him—they were all killed by Divine Doctor Tang.”</p><p>“What?!”</p><p>Both Yang Shi and Liu Pinxin were greatly shocked at the same time with eyes full of disbelief. How could they not know of the tragedy that happened to the Occult Sect six months ago? They had investigated it for a long time, yet they were unable to find the cause. It turned out that it was actually Divine Doctor Tang who did the massacre. But then again, for what reasons did the Occult Sect’s people provoke Tang Xiu?</p><p>“What exactly was the cause?” asked Yang Shi in a whisper.</p><p>Song Donglai hesitated for a moment before he answered, “I don’t know the specific causes, but I heard some news from the rumors. Many families under my Occult Sect received a summon from some cultivators to go to Kanas to carry out something big. But for reasons unknown, they got into a conflict with Divine Doctor Tang there. Not only were a lot of Occult Sect’s people killed, but even those cultivators who summoned them were all dead as well. I’ve been under punishment from my family and I haven’t returned back for decades, yet my family sent me a warning that I can provoke anyone but I must never provoke the Big Boss of the Magnificent Tang Corporation—Tang Xiu.”</p><p>Yang Shi was seriously shocked. Although she knew that Tang Xiu was very strong, she didn’t expect that he was powerful to the extent that he could easily slaughter so many people from the Occult Sect. What’s more, he also ruthlessly annihilated those cultivators.</p><p>‘He’s a big tree—a huge backer’</p><p>Yang Shi shifted her way of thoughts and suddenly got excited. It was because she had decided to follow Tang Xiu and her decision proved to be correct. She had faint worries previously, afraid that Tang Xiu only had a few means to propel her cultivation further due to her old age. But now it seemed that Tang Xiu was truly powerful beyond everything she could imagine!</p><p>Shooting a deep gaze at Song Donglai, Yang Shi spoke to him in a deep voice, “You didn’t say anything about this matter and we didn’t ask you about that either. Divine Doctor Tang has picked your place to dine, so you must serve him well and be on good terms with him. We still have time, but we won’t stay any longer.”</p><p>“I will. Please rest assured!”</p><p>Song Donglai originally wanted Yang Shi and Liu Pinxin to speak good about him in front of Tang Xiu. But he finally realized that they didn’t have that intention at all. It made him vexed inside, though he didn’t dare show it.</p><p>A short while after the departure of Yang Shi and Liu Pinxin, Song Donglai gritted his teeth and turned his head to speak to the bald middle-aged man, “Go to my office immediately and take two bottles of God’s Nectar. There’s also some Dahongpao tea in my office. Take it to the Tea Master to brew a pot of tea and deliver it later.”</p><p>“Understood!”</p><p>The bald stocky man didn’t dare delay and left in strides.</p><p>Ten minutes later, when the bald stocky man along with Manager Wang came to Song Donglai, the latter stopped pacing back and forth and took a deep breath before handling the two bottles of God’s Nectar. He then ordered the bald man to leave and led Manager Wang to the VIP box’s door and knocked on it.</p><p>“Two honored patrons, how were our Agricola’s dishes? I hope you both are magnanimous enough to forgive us if there was any slight neglect you felt from our treatment.” Song Donglai pretended to not know Tang Xiu’s identity and spoke with a beaming smile.</p><p>Tang Xiu glanced at Li Qiang who stood in front of them and spoke expressionlessly, “The venison is not bad, but it seems to have many special ingredients put on it, doesn’t it?”</p><p>Song Donglai’s heart suddenly thumped and he gulped upon hearing that being mentioned. He let out a dry smile and said, “You can rest assured that even though some ingredients are indeed very special, it won’t have any harmful effects on the human body after we mix them up in our kitchen.”</p><p>“Relax, I don’t have any other meaning mentioning that,” said Tang Xiu. “Well? Isn’t that Gods Nectar? Does your Agricola also provide Gods Nectar wine?”</p><p>“No, no, no,” replied Song Donglai in a hurry. “God’s Nectar is the best wine available. How can we have such high-grade of wine here? It’s just that everyone who dines in our VIP box is our honored, distinguished guests. I also spent great efforts and difficulties to obtain these two bottles of God’s Nectar for us to have. Manager Wang, why are you dozing off here for? Quickly pour tea for Mr. Tang!”</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Although Manager Wang didn’t understand why her Boss had a 180-degree turn in his attitude towards Tang Xiu, she still respectfully poured the brewed tea into the cups and served them in front of the duo.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
