Yet, it was as though the scythe of the Grim Reaper activated every time gunshots were heard as they harvested the life of the person shot. In just a few minutes, six big men with heavy murderous auras were killed, falling into their own pool of blood.</p><p>“FUCK!”</p><p>Singkuo could only helplessly look at his men that were constantly being targeted by the mysterious sniper. His eyes were as though spewing out flames. The anger on his face quickly turned into a ferocious expression and the killing aura around him turned more intense. He had investigated the men under Singluen, and there was no outstanding sniper such as this one. More so that the other party was nothing but assassins from all over the world. None of them was a practitioner of his Dark Shaman clan.</p><p>“The marksmanship of the enemy is too accurate, Boss. He also keeps moving, so we can’t lock onto his position.” Herde, who was wearing a tinted camouflage suit and held a sniper rifle, reported with a scowl on his face. He used to be the ace sniper of the Golden Flame mercenary group and a death reaper on the battlefield who had killed countless enemies. Encountering another sniper who was able to suppress him was a very horrific feeling for him.</p><p>A chilling light flashed in Singkuo’s eyes. He was well aware of the many abilities possessed by Herde. Yet, the fella was unable to lock onto the enemy at all. It was obvious that the enemy’s strength was formidable.</p><p>“Cease attacking and immediately investigate the owner of this coconut plantation. I want accurate intel in 30 minutes!”</p><p>A few kilometers away from the scene, Zuo Daquan, who was hiding atop the water tower, stared dumbly at the scene in front of him through his binoculars. Never in his wildest dreams would a gun battle occur in his coconut plantation, nor would so many enemies come to attack it. The most surprising thing was that there was also a mysterious sniper that was able to deter and force the enemies back.</p><p>“Who the hell is this guy?” He put down his binoculars and turned to look at the few confidants around him, inquiring.</p><p>The men around him exchanged glances and shook their heads at the same time. The scene had likewise made them shocked because they had already evacuated everyone in the plantation. It had simply been deserted. Furthermore, although they were also skilled men who had encountered powerful figures, none of them could be compared to this sniper who was in a killing spree and claiming a human life with each bullet shot out.</p><p>“There’s no way he’s one of us, Boss,” whispered a middle-aged big man.</p><p>Zuo Daquan looked again with his binoculars and carefully observed the scene. Then he said, “This man is using a bunker to cover himself, but his concealment ability is extraordinary; only a true expert would be able to do it. All I can say is that we’re just unlucky if this incident has nothing to do with us. We got someone hiding in our plantation but we never found him, yet his enemy found him and now came for revenge.”</p><p>The middle-aged man nodded, “The chance is very likely—otherwise…”</p><p>Bang, bang…</p><p>Suddenly, the gunshots sounded again in the coconut plantation. This time, however, the shootings didn’t come from one person, but four or five men at the same time. Above all, the shooters were not the dozens of people who attacked, but people who were defending the coconut plantation.</p><p>In that instant, the middle-aged man’s face turned extremely nasty. Even Zuo Daquan wore a look of disbelief. The fact that more than 4 people were in his coconut plantation simply overthrew his speculations, smacking him in the face.</p><p>“What the hell is going on there? Who exactly are those fellas?”</p><p>Zuo Daquan was completely stunned. His hands that held the binoculars slightly shivered.</p><p>Deep inside the coconut plantation, Jin Shi was hiding behind the window of a building as he picked up his earphones and spoke, “Everyone, Boss is coming in 30 minutes, so we shall sweep them over to pick off as many as possible. Hold them in their spot and leave no chance to advance or leave. The intel the Boss just sent me says that it’s Singluo who has come here with his direct subordinates. Our mission will be half done if we can remove them.”</p><p>Chilling light gleamed in Mo Awu’s eyes as he said coldly, “If it wasn’t for the Boss’s order, we would just completely annihilate them directly. Anyway, where the heck is Xue Sha? He didn’t appear in his assigned spot just now.”</p><p>“Whoosh!”</p><p>A figure suddenly flickered lightning-fast and then appeared next to them. It was Xue Sha as he joined the conversation with visible killing intent in his eyes, whispering, “I got a bunch of mysterious company near my position before. They should be the Dark Shaman experts planning an ambush in the dark. I can sense that some of them kinda gave me a threatening feeling.”</p><p>“Heh, they must be the manpower Singkuo has arranged to ambush us!” Jin Shi coldly snorted and said, “Xue Sha, keep an eye on them and inform us at once the moment they take action.”</p><p>“Our present task is to hold them up and buy some time, guys.” Mo Awu pulled his pistol out and coldly said, “Let’s give them a warning and let them know that we’ve found them.”</p><p>With that said, he fired his gun several times towards the hiding position in the southeast of Jin Shi, and then quickly moved to another position and appeared by another window.</p><p>In the southeast, behind lush greenery and trees, more than a dozen ghostlike shadows were hiding. Their whole bodies were covered by blurry fog with auras that made the temperature in the surroundings drop several degrees. A white-haired old man in a black robe, Singli, had his eyes glued to the front. His eyes were as though able to penetrate the darkness and able to see the dangers of hiding in the dark from the building in front.</p><p>“Heng…”</p><p>As a few bullets came from that direction towards his position, Singli quickly waved his long sleeves. Several blobs of black fog instantly appeared and wrapped the bullets, making them float in the air over four meters away.</p><p>“Leave this spot! They’ve found our position.”</p><p>In that instant, the dozen ghostly figures quickly retreated back behind the shade of the tree without any sound.</p><p>Time passed by and the situation fell into a deadlock.</p><p>Half an hour later, two cars came and parked on the road over five kilometers away from the coconut plantation. Tang Xiu and the rest quickly came out, followed by Singluen and the dozens of men he had trained, quickly lurking toward the coconut plantation.</p><p>“Keep moving while covert!”</p><p>As they approached the coconut plantation, several cars parked by the roadside entered Tang Xiu’s line of sight, along with several of Singkuo’s men with firearms guarding them.</p><p>Singluen came to Tang Xiu’s side and whispered, “What do we do next?”</p><p>With killing intent gleaming in his eyes, Tang Xiu answered, “We’ll find out the specific position of the enemy first, and then inform Jin Shi’s team in the coconut plantation to attack them on both sides at the same time to kill Singkuo and his men as quickly as possible. None of them must be left alive.”</p><p>“I concur. These guys are all Singkuo’s trusted men, so let’s kill them all.” Singluen firmly nodded. “My side’s strength has progressed steadily as of late. We’re at least several times stronger than before. Even if some freakish old monster in our clan is there to protect Singkuo, we’ll definitely be able to hold and neutralize them here.”</p><p>Tang Xiu nodded in response and then said to Tang Guang, “Confirm the enemy’s position, especially the spot where Singkuo is hiding. Kill him if you find any chance, but return at once to report to me if you’ve got no chance. We’ll strike them in five minutes.”</p><p>“Understood!” Tang Guang nodded and replied.</p><p>His figure then flickered and instantly disappeared into the darkness in front like a flashing arrow. Two minutes later, he returned back to Tang Xiu’s front and shook his head. “Singkuo has got many experts around him, so I can’t kill him. Furthermore, there are forty-plus men at our 11 o’clock; a few of them have firearms, while the rest have magic staffs and cold weapons. They should be the Dark Shaman Clan’s experts. I also found more than a dozen men towards our 1 o’clock. They are able to hide their presence very well and should be more powerful than the experts around Singkuo.</p><p>Having said that, Tang Guang took out a piece of paper and handed it to Tang Xiu, continuing his report, “An just made a sketch of an old man who leads the 1 o’clock group.”</p><p>Singluen observed the sketch a few times before his pupils suddenly contracted, an expression of hatred filling his eyes. He then said in a deep voice, “I know him. Nobody in my clan doesn’t know this man. He’s Singli, my father’s right-hand man and also my third uncle. He’s known by my clansmen as the second most powerful expert in the clan. It seems that our guess is correct, Mr. Tang. My father is really on Singkuo’s side, or else Singkuo wouldn’t be able to make this old man move with his identity.”</p><p>“We guessed that it would turn out like this before; now it’s been confirmed,” said Tang Xiu indifferently. “Singkuo wants your life, and he shall die. If these people sent by your father also want to kill you, I don’t think that keeping them alive would have any advantage for you, Singluen.”</p><p>The statement made Singluen hesitate, and he said with a bitter face, “He’s still my father in any case. He probably doesn’t want to kill me since he didn’t come here. Let’s just wait after we get rid of Singkuo. I’ll personally return to the Dark Shaman clan to resolve this issue with him.”</p><p>Tang Xiu could only sigh inwardly before nodding, “I understand. He’s your father after all. Although the pain of killing your own father will eventually be buried in your heart, some of the pains will never be erased no matter what. Alright, let’s get rid of Singkuo and his men first before dealing with that.”</p><p>Five minutes passed by.</p><p>Tang Xiu then contacted Jin Shi with his mobile phone and issued an attack order. The moment after, Jin Shi’s group of eleven in the building deep inside the coconut plantation moved out lighting fast toward Singkuo’s position, putting away their guns and unleashing their respective immortal sword. In just half a minute, they had already killed six men assigned by Singkuo to keep an eye on them.</p><p>“Bastard!”</p><p>A hoary and furious shout belonging to an old man in a black rob was heard. He quickly swung the staff in his hand as a layer of black fog gradually emerged in the surroundings.</p><p>“Slash them!”</p><p>The black crazily converged and instantly condensed into a black long blade. As the surrounding space distorted, the black saber covered by the black haze flickered and appeared before Mo Awu and Jin Shi in an attempt to slash their bodies in the blink of an eye.</p><p>“Rainbow Sword—Break!”</p><p>Mo Awu’s leg stepped forward, and sword energy burst out from his immortal sword, causing a gale that smashed forward to clash with the black saber.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
