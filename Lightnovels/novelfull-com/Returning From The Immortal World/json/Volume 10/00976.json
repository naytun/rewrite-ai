The busy port was packed with people hurrying to and from the moored and sailing ships.</p><p>“Boss!”</p><p>Tom Reggie had received the notice in advance, and he had long been waiting with a few of his trusted men. Ever since he went to Nine Dragons Island with Tang Xiu a few days ago and saw the power of the Everlasting Feast Hall’s experts under Tang Xiu, he had firmly made up his mind to work and follow Tang Xiu for his entire life, and thus obtain himself a cultivation art that would make him stronger. He returned back earlier a couple of days ago since he received a very important message.</p><p>Tang Xiu walked forward and came to the front of Tom Reggie as his eyes swept the surroundings. Then, he asked with an indifferent face, “How is the progress with the task I gave you?”</p><p>“I’ve confirmed the identity of the other party, Boss. But we have been standing still so as to avoid alerting them,” answered Tom Reggie. “Sen… ah, Mr. Song told me to wait until you return to Saipan to make a decision, though.”</p><p>“Heh, they haven’t given up on spying on me. Might as well pull out these nails,” sneered Tang Xiu with squinted eyes. “Taking action during the day will create unnecessary problems, so we’ll move tonight to avoid trouble. Anyway, you know where Uncle Song lives, right? Tell me the address. I’m going to visit him.”</p><p>Tom Reggie told Tang Xiu the address, but there was hesitation on his face as he reported again, “Mr. Song’s residence is under the surveillance of the Darkwind organization’s people, Boss. If you visit him this openly, I’m afraid that you’ll also enter their eyes. How about I send someone to inform Mr. Song first to tell him to meet you elsewhere?”</p><p>“The Darkwind organization is the largest intelligence agency in the world, and it is said that they have a lot of spies literally everywhere,” sneered Tang Xiu. “Who can guarantee that their branch here hasn’t caught the news of my return to Saipan when I set foot on the shore? There’s no need to hide from them now that I’m here. It’s even possible to dispel their suspicions if I visit Uncle Song openly.”</p><p>Tom Reggie seemed to think about it for a moment before he nodded, “True that. It will look even more suspicious if you’re avoiding being seen. Nevertheless, the Darkwind organization will likely be able to conclude that there’s something between me and Mr. Song if they know that you’re coming.”</p><p>“Do you think that if your former backer didn’t go and find someone from the Darkwind organization, then their spies wouldn’t take the initiative to tell him about the private meeting between you and Uncle Song?” asked Tang Xiu indifferently.</p><p>“Not really. I know a bit about how they work, Boss.” Tom Reggie shook his head and said, “They won’t take the initiative to sell intel unless there’s someone wanting to buy it. However, there’s a possibility regarding that matter as far as I’m concerned.”</p><p>“Which possibility?” asked Tang Xiu.</p><p>“My former backer himself is a member of the Darkwind organization, Boss,” said Tom Reggie.</p><p>Tang Xiu’s expression changed. But he shook his head and said, “He won’t easily rely on any non-governmental forces if he becomes a high-ranking official. Otherwise, even if he did it in secrecy, there will be a day of exposing his tail. The Saipan authorities won’t sit idly by and do nothing about them.”</p><p>“You’re also right, Boss.” Tom Reggie nodded and said, “Still, please be careful since I won’t be able to follow you when you visit Mr. Song.”</p><p>“There’s no need to follow me, Tom.” Tang Xiu smiled and said, “Just take care of the preparation well, as your role is indispensable when Uncle Song takes on the Big Boss of Saipan.”</p><p>“I’ll be careful. You can rest assured about that, Boss.” Tom Reggie nodded.</p><p>Tang Xiu nodded and ordered Tom Reggie to bring Singluen’s group to the Lao Bay Resort. Then, he took his eleven bodyguards under Mo Awu and Jin Shi’s leadership to rush to Song Guanghui’s residence. This time, he also took Tang Guang and Tang An from Nine Dragons Island. But just like Jin Shi and his team, they didn’t directly follow Tang Xiu, but were simply nearby. They wouldn’t appear unless Tang Xiu summoned them.</p><p>The Jinla Mansion.</p><p>Located near Hepburn Avenue was a complex with a beautiful environment and convenient transportation, with residents of the high stature in society. The Jinla Mansion was the most expensive mansion in this complex and was guarded by dozens of soldiers all year round, including even more guarding in secret.</p><p>“Who are you? This is a private residence of an official. Nobodies must leave immediately!”</p><p>Just as Tang Xiu and Mo Awu came to the gate of Jinla Mansion, the shout of a big man in a military uniform immediately greeted them, while four other armed soldiers followed.</p><p>“Is this the mansion of General Sen Hui?” asked Tang Xiu calmly, “I’m General’s acquaintance and have a close relationship with him. Please notify him that Tang Xiu has come to visit.”</p><p>The soldier observed Tang Xiu and rose his gun’s muzzle, coldly replying, “Are you even qualified to visit the General’s mansion, huh? If everyone else is just like you, then those who have seen the General once will flock over here and make his residence be just like downtown. Leave at once, or don’t blame us for arresting you!”</p><p>Tang Xiu creased his brows and took out his cell phone and said, “Since you’re so rigid with your rules, you won’t mind if I directly call General Sen Hui, will you?”</p><p>The response from the soldier was only a contemptuous look, although he didn’t force Tang Xiu to leave. Instead, he kept his vigilant attitude in observing Tang Xiu, guarding against any sudden attack.</p><p>Tang Xiu then dialed Song Guanghui’s private number. After several rings, his call was picked up and Song Guanghui’s hearty laughter greeted him on the other side.</p><p>“You’re back, Tang Xiu?”</p><p>“Mmm.” Tang Xiu let out a smile and said, “I just returned to Saipan, so I went to your home to visit you. However, your soldier guard stopped me at the gate.”</p><p>“Eh? You’re at my house?” said Song Guanghui with a surprised voice, “That’s great! Alright, give your cell phone to the guards at the gate. I’m still busy with official business at the moment, so I’m afraid I can only be at home two hours from now. But your auntie is at home, so I’ll call her after this to tell her to entertain you.”</p><p>“Alright, I’ll wait for you, uncle.” Tang Xiu replied, then handed over the mobile phone to the soldier and said, “It’s General Sen Hui on the phone. He wants to talk to you.”</p><p>With a half-doubting and half-believing face, the soldier took the mobile phone. The moment he recognized Song Guanghui’s voice from the phone, his expression turned more respectful and he repeatedly nodded. As he eventually hung up the call, he looked at Tang Xiu and apologized, “I’m really sorry, Mr. Tang. I had no idea that you’re an honored guest of the General, so I was rude to you. Anyhow, the General has told me that you can go straight to his residence and wait for him.”</p><p>Tang Xiu nodded and led Mo Awu to enter the mansion’s front door under the watchful eyes of the soldiers. The Jinla Mansion had a large area, comprising of at least several acres of land. It took Tang Xiu and Mo Awu more than 10 minutes to pass by the garden in the outer courtyard alone.</p><p>Suddenly, a young army officer in full military uniform came out from the inside courtyard. After he saw Tang Xiu and Mo Awu, he immediately asked with a curious face, “Eh? Who are you guys?”</p><p>“I’m Tang Xiu from China,” answered Tang Xiu with a light smile. “Your appearance is a resemblance to Uncle Song’s. Given your young age and you strolling so casually inside the Jinla Mansion, you should be Uncle Song’s son, right? Are you Song Xiang, or Song Yang?”</p><p>“Ah?! So you’re the Tang Xiu that Dad mentioned?” the young officer was surprised and said, “I’m Song Xiang by the way.”</p><p>“A heroic posture; an elegant and imposing appearance. You truly depict the adage in China that a tiger father would never beget a dog-like son,” said Tang Xiu smilingly while stretching out his hands. “You should be half a year older than me, so I’ll call you Brother Xian. Nice to meet you.”</p><p>Instead of replying, Song Xiang quickly glanced around; only after he found that there was nobody in the surroundings did he finally shake hands with Tang Xiu, amiably replying, “Tang Xiu brother, Dad has told me and my family about the issue regarding Uncle Tang. Well, too many times to count, in fact. I’m glad you came to visit us here. Please come in and let’s chat inside.”</p><p>Tang Xiu nodded with a smile in response. He then moved his hands into his pocket to take out a small gift box. He handed it to Song Xiang, saying, “Brother Xiang, this is a gift for our first meeting. I hope you accept it.”</p><p>Song Xiang’s smile turned wider and, after receiving it, he said, “It’s kind of you, Brother Tang. Can I open it?”</p><p>“Please,” said Tang Xiu with a nod.</p><p>Song Xiang swiftly opened the small gift box. When he saw a beautifully carved jade tablet inside, he immediately said with a smile, “It’s a very expensive gift. Brother Tang surely has spent a fortune on it. Anyway, Dad said that he’s a sworn life-and-death brother with your father, so we are also brothers. We’re a family, so you don’t have to regard us as strangers in the future.”</p><p>“Exactly the same sentiment is in my heart,” replied Tang Xiu with a smile.</p><p>The three people had yet to enter the inner courtyard when a graceful, yet pale-looking, woman came out of the courtyard gate. Her appearance was like a beautiful lady who was ill, but her gorgeous eyes suddenly turned bright when she saw Tang Xiu, softly greeting him with a smile, “You must be the son of Big Brother Tang, Tang Xiu, right? I’m Guanghui’s wife. Just call me auntie.”</p><p>“Hello, Auntie. Pleased to meet you. I’m Tang Xiu indeed,” greeted back Tang Xiu hurriedly.</p><p>Wen Jing nodded with a happy face and said, “I haven’t seen Big Brother Tang for so many years. You know, we originally thought that he had encountered an accident, so it’s really a happy surprise to us that he’s still alive and even has a grown-up son. A tiger father truly won’t have a dog-like son. Your father has been a big hero in the past, and as his son you’re not inferior to him. I’m truly very happy for him.”</p><p>“Dad has also mentioned you to me, Auntie,” said Tang Xiu. “He said that you were always with Uncle Song when performing your duties overseas. He even told me that he and Uncle Song wouldn’t have survived if it weren’t for your care back when they were gravely injured.”</p><p>Wen Jing grabbed Tang Xiu’s hand and amiably said, “Well, it’s all in the past; it’s nothing to speak of today. Anyhow, your Uncle is still working outside, but we shall have a feast tonight when he comes back. Alright, let’s go and sit inside. Auntie is going to cook and personally serve some delicious meals for you.”</p><p>“Alright, and thank you, Auntie.”</p><p>After he said that, Tang Xiu turned around to grab the gift box prepared in advance from Mo Awu. He handed it over to Wen Jing and said, “I brought a gift for you, Auntie; please receive it. I hope you like it.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
