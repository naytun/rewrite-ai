With fear now gushing out and reflecting in his eyes, the shadow of death seemed to have come to loom over his head. He had long hated Tang Xiu and wished that he could mutilate him to pieces, pulling out his tendons and skinning him alive. Yet, he didn’t want to die. He must live and accumulate power. Only then would he be able to carry out his vendetta for the blood shed by his family.</p><p>That’s right. Yao is his family name, the Yao from Beijing, China.</p><p>His family was once a force to be reckoned with in China and possessed great energy and power. He had been sent overseas by his family in secret, and after many years of operation, he succeeded in becoming an intelligence officer of the Darkwind organization before he was appointed as the Branch Supervisor in Saipan due to his merits. Those who knew about his identity even in House Yao were limited only to the Family Head and a very few senior members, so how could he not know Tang Xiu in front of him even though the others may not?</p><p>“Are you curious how I found out about it?” asked Tang Xiu with a smile.</p><p>Standing up from the floor, Yao Guchun jumped two steps backwards vigilantly, putting his hands in his trouser’s pockets. He asked with a bitter expression, “I am. I’m really curious how you found out that my surname is Yao. Not even the Darkwind’s top management have been able to investigate my true identity no matter how pervasive their network is.”</p><p>“Well, it was just a guess,” said Tang Xiu with a smile.</p><p>“What?!” Yao Guchun stared blankly, but it was quickly replaced by anger as he growled, “You just fucking set me up with your words, fucking bastard! You do want to completely annihilate us, don’t you?”</p><p>“Hahaha.” Tang Xiu raucously laughed and said, “I did send my men to kill the core members and those whose combat prowess was enough to work for your family. But I have nothing to do with the rest of the ordinary members of your family, nor did I do anything to those average martial artists. Ask yourself who made your family be so arrogant and rely on their tyrannical power to offend people left and right? The Yao isolated themselves, which was the very cause of your own downfall. There were too many clans, families, forces, and people to count who immediately jumped out to beat your family right after your downfall. If you want to resent and hate someone, hate your own family for what they have done for so many years.”</p><p>“If it weren’t for you; no, if it weren’t for your Tang Family, how could my Yao Family have fallen so miserably?” roared Yao Guchun. “I fucking hate you, yes. I can’t wait to slice your flesh, skin you alive, drink your blood and eat your flesh, but what about it? I’m the Saipan Branch Supervisor for the Darkwind organization, a senior officer of the Darkwind. Do you dare kill me?”</p><p>Having said that, he pulled his hand out of his pocket, now holding a small black remote control. His finger was ready to press the red button on the remote.</p><p>Tang Xiu creased his brows and had a bad hunch.</p><p>It was a crisis!</p><p>A sense of emergency intensely grew inside him at the moment Yao Guchun pulled out the remote control. A pang of regret also ate at his mind as to why he didn’t directly kill Yao Guchun or had him under control, leading to a situation where he lost the ability to act.</p><p>“You have your own trump card, it seems,” said Tang Xiu slowly after being silent for several seconds.</p><p>A ferocious look on his face, Yao Guchun growled, “You guessed it. This is my trump card—a life-saving one, making it so you won’t dare to take any audacious and reckless move. This is the branch of the Darkwind in Saipan, the very place for us to be able to drag our enemies to hell with us. You didn’t expect it, did you? This place has been rigged with highly explosive TNT everywhere. Once I press this button, all of them will detonate and everything will be blown into pieces.”</p><p>Tang Xiu instantly unleashed his perception and quickly covered hundreds of meters area. Much to his dread, the said explosives had indeed been planted in several extremely hidden places in the surroundings. However, what he dreaded was not exactly the bombs in these places, but the ones deeper underground. Those gave him a dreadful sensation, almost like great suffering was looming over him, which could bring him death.</p><p>‘With my Heavenly Art of Cosmic Genesis, I may be able to survive, albeit barely. But Mo Awu, Jin Shi and the rest who are also hiding here won’t make it once all these explosives are detonated.’</p><p>‘Do I have to give up this chance to kill Yao Guchun? If I am to let him off this time, it’s highly likely he’ll pass on the intel about me to the Darkwind headquarters. Once it happens, they will definitely set their sight on me and do everything in their power to investigate anything about me. Regardless of how good the Everlasting Feast Hall has been concealing our existence, clues that eventually expose information about me are inevitable.’</p><p>‘Is there any way to kill Yao Guchun now while still preventing him from detonating the explosives?’</p><p>‘Should I order An to secretly assassinate him now? But this is not a realistic option, since it’s unlikely for her to be able to prevent his finger from pressing the button the moment she acts.’</p><p>‘I don’t think the Body Controlling Art is an option either as it’s too late to cast it.’</p><p>“…”</p><p>Countless thoughts popped in and out of Tang Xiu’s mind until he was finally at his wit’s end. He then looked at Yao Guchun’s ferocious expression and shook his head slowly.</p><p>“You win,” said Tang Xiu while looking at Yao Guchun. “I can’t kill you indeed. But you must promise me that no info about me will be passed to the Darkwind headquarters. I’m sure you already know what I’m capable of. If I want to kill you, even if you flee to the ends of the Earth, you will only have a dead end in any corner of the world.”</p><p>Only then did Yao Guchun’s tightened heart feel relaxed. He stared at Tang Xiu with a complicated expression before nodding. He didn’t want to die. It was better to live than to die. As long as he was alive, everything was possible. He could achieve nothing while dead.</p><p>Aside from that, Tang Xiu was correct. No matter where in the world he ran to hide at, he wouldn’t be able to survive if Tang Xiu was really hell-bent on killing him.</p><p>As someone in the management of the Darkwind, Yao Guchun was perfectly aware that interest and profit were the supreme code of his agency. As long as the interest and money were sufficient, the top management of the Darkwind organization wouldn’t hesitate to sell him out should Tang Xiu decide to purchase him. So much so that his own employer would even send a lot of assassins to kill him if Tang Xiu was able to pay a lot.</p><p>“I give you my word.”</p><p>Tang Xiu nodded and said, “Just remember the perpetual custom of the world, that those who have been defeated end up as villains and the victors turn into kings. The Yaos only have themselves to blame for their downfall that ended up at this fate. My Tang Family didn’t take the initiative to go against your family. It was your family who wanted to take advantage of the weakened state of my Tang Family. You all had been coveting my family with your constant provocations and attacks. It is already doomed that you won’t be able to enact revenge for your clansmen, so cast away your hatred for me.”</p><p>For more than 10 seconds, Yao Guchun fell into silence before he said with a dull and gloomy expression, “I understand. I’ll never take the initiative to pass the information about you to my organization unless I’m tired of living. But I assure you that I’ll leave behind a contingency measure and the information about you will be on the desk of my Big Boss should you dare to kill me!”</p><p>“Suit yourself!”</p><p>Tang Xiu replied and turned around to head to the door. Just as he stepped out of the room, he suddenly stopped his pace and looked at Yao Guchun, “This is a deal between us, but I’ll add another condition. Should you break today’s deal, then all the clansmen of your Yao Family will follow you to Hell. You can rest assured that no matter how big the price I must pay, I’ll investigate everyone with Yao blood in them, so play no tricks and behave yourself if you don’t want your family bloodline to be completely exterminated.”</p><p>With that said, Tang Xiu strode away.</p><p>With seething killing intent inside him, Yao Guchun’s finger on the hand that held the remote control was placed on the red button, and his eyes followed Tang Xiu out of the room. After seeing a lot of Darkwind people come rushing out to stop Tang Xiu and Mo Awu on the way out, he issued an order to them to not attempt to halt their departure. It wasn’t until Tang Xiu and Mo Awu left the area did he finally breathe a sigh of relief.</p><p>‘The top management will definitely hear the news that Tang Xiu and his men intruded this place today. I gotta think of a perfect way to solve this pressing issue. This Tang Xiu bastard is too bizarre. It seems like it’s impossible for me to avenge my family in this life. But still, I must sort out and find any information about him and then hand it over to someone trustworthy. He can expect to have endless troubles haunting him if he dares to kill me.’</p><p>Yao Guchun turned back into the room but didn’t put away the remote control. His finger was not even removed from the button.</p><p>Time passed by and after a few hours, it was already late at night.</p><p>Yao Guchun still observed the surroundings with a dead-serious expression. After he found that there wasn’t the slightest sign of disturbance or sound in the surroundings, only then did he finally lift his finger from the remote control’s button.</p><p>Whish…</p><p>Just half a meter away, a flickering light of a sword suddenly flashed and directly cut off Yao Guchun’s arm, then beheading him. In that instant, the black-dressed Tang An appeared and snatched the remote control from the chopped arm’s palm.</p><p>As Yao Guchun’s head was cut off, he continued to see the swirling and flashing world around him. He saw his headless body, as well as a female with a bronze mask take the remote control from his chopped arm.</p><p>‘Fucking asshole. He didn’t keep his word…’</p><p>‘Only dead men can tell no tales indeed…’</p><p>With these last two thoughts in mind, Yao Guchun’s consciousness finally dispersed into nothingness.</p><p>Tang An apathetically looked at Yao Guchun’s dead body before her figure flickered and instantly disappeared out of thin air. In just dozens of seconds, she appeared a few kilometers away in front of Tang Xiu and called out while giving him the remote control.</p><p>“Boss!”</p><p>“Well done.” Tang Xiu nodded in satisfaction and said, “There’s another task I need you to carry out. I want you to get all the information available here tonight, especially the list that records the Darkwind’s members in Saipan. Once you get them, eliminate them no matter how many of them there are!”</p><p>“Consider it done!” replied Tang An.</p><p>Her body then flickered and disappeared again. At the same time, Jin Shi and the rest simultaneously moved to lurk toward the Darkwind branch.</p><p>Mo Awu, however, looked indifferent and asked, “Would you like me to stay behind, Boss?”</p><p>Tang Xiu handed the remote control to Mo Awu and nodded, “There’s no need to stay here after you’ve accomplished the mission.”</p><p>“Understood!”</p><p>Mo Awu complied and quickly followed Jin Shi and the rest.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
