The Lian Family was indeed under the Occult Sect and they looked like they did things in a just and correct way, yet they secretly committed evil and wicked deeds behind the scenes. It was something that he and his two brothers were very aware of.</p><p>He still remembers the members of the Lian Family he has killed in the past. Some of them used demonic tools to commit their atrocious inhumane deeds. Song Donglai then inhaled deeply to calm down his restlessness and sneered back, “Who’ll live or die today is still hard to say now!”</p><p>“Do you think we are afraid of you since you’ve set up a trap here?” shouted Lian Bai as he ferociously laughed, “Where are those two fuckers beside you? Ao Wei and Gong Quan? Make them roll out too!”</p><p>Not far away from them, Gong Quan came with a dozen of his confidants. Yet he didn’t even spare a glance to the aggressive and threatening Lian Bai’s group, and kept observing and sensing the air fluctuations in the surroundings with full vigilance. For him, the hidden assassin he just encountered was the most dangerous existence.</p><p>Halfway up the hillside.</p><p>Tang Xiu wore a profound expression and his eyes kept lingering on the Lian Family. Several hundreds of meters of distance were not far to him, and he could sense that the surrounding temperature drop all of a sudden right as these people arrived. It was like there was some hidden death qi coming from the Lian Family’s direction.</p><p>Is it the Ghost race, the resentful specters, or one who has cultivated a ghost cultivation technique?</p><p>It never occurred to him that such an interesting matter would present itself to him; after all, he was only here to watch and observe the battle. All that which has been unfolded piqued his interest as to what other existences Earth had. Not only has he found the traces of immortals and the legacies they left behind, but now has also encountered such a rich death qi. Could it be that a ghost race cultivation technique also exists on Earth?</p><p>Xue Yu, who stood beside Tang Xiu, also watched as the two sides drew their weapons and aimed them at each other. She then asked, “Tang Xiu, which side do you think is more powerful?”</p><p>“Dong Donglai and his people will definitely die this time if there’s no unforeseen accident,” answered Tang Xiu.</p><p>“Is it because of those two old men?” asked Xue Yu in surprise.</p><p>“That’s right.” Tang Xiu nodded and explained, “I’ve seen the ancestors of some families under the Occult Sect. They’re so decrepit and just half a step from their grave, yet they possess horrifying strength. Nearly all of them are martial artists who have embarked on the cultivation path. Although most of them don’t have any cultivation techniques, making it nearly impossible to break through the Foundation Establishment stage, many of them could still contend with those at the Foundation Establishment Stage just by their Qi Refining Stage cultivation.”</p><p>“So, are you really not going to help Boss Song?” asked Xue Yu.</p><p>“No.” Tang Xiu shook his head and said, “Song Donglai actually possesses great talent—he reached the martial art grandmaster level at less than 50 years old. It’s not an easy feat to achieve. This time, he wants to take advantage of the Blood Python Array to chance upon the opportunity with his two brothers—an endeavor they must only rely on themselves with, no less.”</p><p>Xue Yu didn’t ask again, yet she was mulling over some thoughts inside her mind.</p><p>Tang Xiu turned to look at her and said again, “Do you think I should help him because I, at least, are familiar with him?”</p><p>“Yeah, he’s very respectful to you.” Xue Yu nodded.</p><p>Tang Xiu shook his head and said, “There was once a time when countless people respected me. Those who once begged for my help were too many to count, just like the school of fishes that cross the river. I also could have saved countless people if I wanted to, yet I just watched them die. It’s not that I have a heart made of stone, but it was because the Heavenly Dao is merciless and ruthless. Ever since I set my foot on the cultivation path, I’ve been struggling and fighting on my own—though of course, there have been some exceptions to the case, regardless.”</p><p>“Which exceptions?” asked Xue Yu.</p><p>Tang Xiu smiled and said, “They are those whom I care about. Even if they are cripples or the so-called dregs on the cultivation path and are unwilling to get into danger, I will always help them. I’ll provide them all the cultivation techniques, resources, and experiences. I’ll also guarantee their safety.”</p><p>“I suddenly feel that I’m very lucky,” said Xue Yu softly.</p><p>“You know, luck is oftentimes an important factor in success,” said Tang Xiu with a chuckle.</p><p>In Green Lake Agricola.</p><p>The Lian Family’s ancestor, Lian Wenxin, slowly walked to Lian Bai’s side and likewise, watched the people in front of him as though they were already dead. He slowly took out some black ink from his green long robe and said in a grim voice, “What a waste of a quarrel, using just words. Just annihilate all the enemies today and don’t delay their move to reincarnation.”</p><p>Lian Bai unsheathed his saber and shouted ferociously, “KILL THEM ALL!”</p><p>Dozens of meters away, Boss Huang and his more than 20 henchmen were originally harboring the thought of watching the fun, even though they were also a bit restless. However, when the Lian Family’s ancestor spoke, a chilling current seeped into their mind, sending a chill down their spines.</p><p>The combat between martial artists always involved the glints and flashes of cold steel with a foul wind and a rain of blood in its wake. When arms were flying and blood splashing and the two sides suffered casualties and injuries during the fight, Boss Huang and his henchmen felt as though they were falling into ice holes, filled by a fear that nearly made them scream out.</p><p>Li Qiang suddenly grabbed Boss Huang and said in a pressed voice, “Boss, tell your men to help my cousin quickly! Otherwise, the other party will probably not let us leave if he gets defeated.”</p><p>Boss Huang was hardly able to turn head as he looked at Li Qiang with a face full of fear, saying, “These people… are from the martial world! How can I help them? Don’t tell me you want me to send them to their deaths?”</p><p>“Even if they can only gang up against one man, that’s still great merit as long as they can bring down some of them!” said Li Qiang hurriedly, “Besides, I must take you to hide somewhere right away. If there are too many people with us, we’ll be easily exposed even if we’re hiding.”</p><p>Boss Huang’s lips squirmed a few times and he immediately shouted, “All of you, go there and help Boss Song. Anyone of you who can injure those people, I’ll reward you a million yuan. 2 million yuan for whoever can kill one of them. Hurry up!”</p><p>People do say that there will always be one who is brave enough to take the risks if the rewards are generous enough.</p><p>These rabbles were henchmen—gangsters raised by Boss Huang himself. They usually help Boss Huang to deal with some unspeakable shady deals, which has earned them tens of thousand yuan each time. It was not a small amount of money in and of itself, but when they heard Boss Huang’s promise, their eyes shined brightly. Although they realized that they were far from being a match for those people, they were actually smart enough to gang up against one of them.</p><p>The number of men under Song Donglai was many times more than those of the Lian Family’s. Although the gap of strength between them and the Lian Family’s people was quite big, the number of people was indeed able to make up for the differences in individual combat prowess, albeit barely. More than 20 hooligans divided into three groups and ganged up on the three experts from the Lian Family quickly.</p><p>Pew, pew, pew…</p><p>With a fluctuation in the air, Xiao Ya soundlessly appeared next to the scar-faced big man, while his sharp dagger pierced the latter’s stomach like a venomous snake. After pulling out the dagger, he moved lightning fast and kill the other three rabbles.</p><p>“Gunshots?!”</p><p>Amid the chaotic scene of battle, the experts of Lian Family who had the upper hand and were dominating the battle had their complexions slightly changed. They could clearly hear the faint gunshots, while some of them who were proficient in firearms were aware that it was not coming from ordinary pistols, but from a very powerful sniper rifle.</p><p>“Xiao Ya! Deal with those snipers!” shouted Lian Bai after his saber cleaved down the enemy and turned to glance around.</p><p>“CRUOR PYTHON!”</p><p>Ao Wei, who had yet to make an appearance on the stage, appeared from the direction of the lakelet. Behind him were strong stocky men lifting a big steel cage two meters in width and height, dashing into the fray. As they were closing on the fighting crowd, Ao Wei ferociously roared and cleaved the chain outside the steel cage and opened its door.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>A more than three meters long blood-colored Cruor Python violently raged and slithered out of the cage. Its mouth opened, exhibiting its chilling, cold fangs at the moment it flashed behind a member of the Lian Family and instantly bit on the left side of his neck.</p><p>Aaaaargh….</p><p>A horrifying and shrill scream came from the man. The Cruor Python didn’t stay still and flung toward the other member of the Lians.</p><p>“Fucking asshole!”</p><p>The Lian Family’s ancestor, Lian Wentian, who had just killed several men under Song Donglai, noticed the bloody-colored python who had just appeared and already killed two of his family members. He immediately wielded a longsword and hurled lightning fast towards the Cruor Python. He had encountered such a ferocious ominous beast before, so he had no fear in facing it.</p><p>The battle between the Cruor Python and Lin Wentian caused the spot to be devoid from anyone else. The anaconda-like Cruor Python was far more powerful than all of the fierce beasts Lin Wentian had killed before. At the moment when a man and a beast were deadlocked in their fight, Lian Wenxin, who had killed a dozen people, finally opened the dark ink bottle in his hand and instantly threw it into the air.</p><p>“Soul Guardian—DEVOUR!”</p><p>Lian Wenxin rose up into the air and, as his roar echoed around, the black ink bottle opened and unleashed a murky-grayish weapon all of a sudden. At the same time, the Nine Fetuses of Hundred Ghosts Streamer the size of a palm instantly appeared from the black bottle, while the gushing eddy that came out with it grew bigger and stronger.</p><p>Halfway up the hill, Tang Xiu’s complexion suddenly changed greatly. His pupils contracted, and disbelief filled them as he could sense the thick death Qi repeatedly surging out at the moment the Nine Fetuses of Hundred Ghosts Streamer unleashed into the air.</p><p>“The Ghost race tool?”</p><p>He easily recognized this Nine Fetuses of a Hundred Ghosts Streamer, since it radiated a very powerful ghosts’ aura containing the grief of the souls within it.</p><p>“What is this Ghost device?” asked Xue Yu confused.</p><p>Tang Xiu’s eyes were flickering, containing some killing intent within them. He replied with a heavy voice, “It’s a device that uses human souls—the souls of those who have been inhumanely tortured with countless cruel and brutal methods. Their souls then turn into wraiths before they get absorbed into this ghost device, which then forms it into a powerful weapon. This Ghost Streamer has at least devoured several hundred human souls, all of them which were tortured inhumanely before they got murdered, making their souls still even be tormented now.”</p><p>“That evil?!!” Xue Yu exclaimed, “Isn’t that the likes of the demon in the legends?”</p><p>“True. There’s not much of a difference between Ghost and Demonic tools, to begin with.” Tang Xiu nodded and said, “Both are just two forms of power, but they are a similarly diabolical evil object. This Lian Family is under the Occult Sect on the surface. I didn’t expect that some of them have refined such a Ghost device. This makes it obvious that this family is wicked!”</p><p>“So, what should we do?” asked Xue Yu quickly.</p><p>“What should we do? Hmph… What other than making sure whether this Ghost device was made or was just refined by the Lian Family?” snorted Tang Xiu coldly. “If they are the ones who did that, or by something else… hmph… then they are damned! All the deceased souls, even the souls of the Lian Family’s deceased members, all must have been swallowed inside that Ghost device!”</p><p>After he said that, Tang Xiu’s figure instantly flew down.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
