He was absolutely a shrewd man of a sophisticated mind and formidable nature, with a set of skills to boot. Even after he got acquainted with Tang Xiu, he inquired about the news regarding this young man and learned that Tang Xiu was a very formidable character—much more powerful than anyone he ever knew.</p><p>He regarded this young man as his friend, and yet, how could he get along with his enemy? Even from the looks of their interaction, they seemed to be very close!</p><p>“Mr. Tang!”</p><p>While suppressing the restlessness and confusion inwardly, Tom Reggie strode to greet and hug Tang Xiu, only sparing a glance at Song Guanghui.</p><p>“There’s no need for me to introduce you to this man, right, Tom?” said Tang Xiu with a faint smile. “You’re always in Saipan, to begin with, so I’m sure you both know each other.”</p><p>With a bit of a strange expression, Tom Reggie nodded, “General Sen Hui, the number two figure in Saipan. I never thought that he would come to my resort. More so that he tagged along with you, Mr. Tang.”</p><p>“He’s anything but an outsider, Tom; he has a very deep relation with me.” Tang Xiu waved and said, “I can tell you that he’s my elder, someone on my side in the truest sense. I already know about what kind of relationship exists between you both, so don’t give him that hostile look. Alright, how about you find some peaceful place so that we can have a chat?”</p><p>“No can do.” Tom Reggie shook his head and said, “There are tons of things I’d like to chat with you about, Mr. Tang, but there’s nothing I want to say to him. I’m Mr. Dawes’s man; nothing good will happen if he hears the news that I was in contact with this man late at night. I hope you can understand.”</p><p>Seeing Tom Reggie’s manner, Song Guanghui’s appraisal toward Tang Xiu dropped a few degrees. He first thought that Tang Xiu was a talented young man, as great as his father used to be. He didn’t expect his mind to be so simple, wanting him to get in touch and tied to Tom Reggie.</p><p>Only after recalling the face of Tang Yunde—his life-and-death sworn brother—was he barely able to repress his dissatisfaction, allowing him to calmly wait for Tang Xiu’s next move.</p><p>“Tom, I already told you that I understand the problems between you two,” said Tang Xiu. “I have my purpose and a reason to discuss it with you. You can trust me that I won’t harm you at all.”</p><p>After slightly hesitating, Tom Reggie still shook his head, “You’re Awen’s Boss, Mr. Tang. You’re also a friend and my business partner, so I naturally trust you. But this man is not someone I can trust, so I can’t comply.”</p><p>Spectre, who was wearing a black cap, paced forward and mocked, “Hmph, nobody in this world is allowed to refuse my Boss’s request, let alone you, Rookie! You have two options now. Number one: immediately prepare a place to chat with my Boss. Number two: I’ll kill you now and support your confidant to replace your place. Pray tell why I shouldn’t waste my strength doing so, Rookie.”</p><p>Being unable to see Spectre’s face, Tom Reggie was quite angry. “Who the fuck are you to interrupt our talk? I’m talking to your boss, not you!”</p><p>Spectre slowly raised his cap. When his entire face appeared in Tom Reggie’s sight, he looked at the latter’s paled face and grimly sneered, “If it weren’t because your heart’s location is different compared to normal people, you wouldn’t be qualified to stand here and talk to my Boss now, would you?”</p><p>The big shock made Tom Reggie pace backwards a few steps. He pointed to Spectre and exclaimed in fright,” You… w-why are you here? Aren’t you…”</p><p>“A word more and I’ll kill you!” cut Spectre with a chilling snort.</p><p>Tom Reggie looked like he ran into his most formidable, unbeatable nemesis. With frightened eyes and a pounding heart, extreme restlessness now engulfed his entire being. Although he used to be a killer who had executed countless people, there were still some people in this world who truly caused him dread. Spectre was exactly one of them. Without him realizing, he raised his hand to touch the location of his heart. There was a scar near there, and the very person who gifted it to him was Spectre, now sitting right before his eyes.</p><p>Tang Xiu creased his brows and asked in surprise, “You know him?”</p><p>“He was once an underling of my target, Boss; and quite a competent one, I admit,” explained Spectre with a grin while licking his lips. “Though it’s rather unfortunate that he’s nothing but trash in my eyes. I didn’t attempt to find and kill him again even after I knew that he was still alive. After all, he wasn’t originally my target back then.”</p><p>“Didn’t you tell me that only a scant number of people in the world can recognize you?” Tang Xiu frowned and said, “While you have been out with me, how come so many people have recognized you, huh?”</p><p>“I promise you there won’t be a third person, Boss!” said Spectre in a hurry.</p><p>Tang Xiu just coldly snorted at him before he looked at Tom Reggie again and said, “I don’t want to repeat what I said for the third time. He’s my elder and truly someone of my own. It’s fine if you still refuse, but do consider what consequences will you have to face later. Because the enemy you’re going to face would probably be me!”</p><p>Throat feeling dry, Tom Reggie shifted his eyes from Spectre to Tang Xiu and astringently nodded, “I’ll arrange it right away. But… could you tell me how he became your man? I can’t think it through at all.”</p><p>“What is it that you can’t understand?” asked Tang Xiu.</p><p>“I just can’t figure out as to why such a dreadful man like him would be willing to be your man,” said Tom Reggie. “He’s an entirely different kind of breed than Awen.”</p><p>“Do you really know and understand who I truly am?” asked Tang Xiu with a faint smile.</p><p>The question made Tom Reggie stunned. He understood what Tang Xiu meant, causing his fear of Tang Xiu to turn more intense than ever before. He took a deep breath and then glanced towards Song Guanghui, saying, “Please come inside, everyone.”</p><p>With an expression turned very strange at this instant, Song Guanghui truly didn’t expect that the twist of events would be reversed just like this. It only took one of Tang Xiu’s men to stand up and speak some vague words, yet Tom Reggie was stricken and panicked, reversing his previous attitude.</p><p>‘Who is Tang Xiu’s man, exactly?’</p><p>Full of confusion, Song Guanghui followed Tang Xiu and the rest to the already prepared villa.</p><p>In the living room on the second floor, Tang Xiu gently patted Zhang Xinya’s shoulder and said, “You go to the room to rest first—we need to discuss something here. Take your time to rest since we’ll be going out to sea early in the morning.”</p><p>Zhang Xinya herself didn’t know too much about Tang Xiu’s affairs, so she understandingly nodded as she went straight towards the stairs to the bedroom on the third floor to rest.</p><p>Tang Xiu took a seat on the sofa in the living room as he looked at Tom Reggie and said, “If I told you to change allegiances and switch to Uncle Song’s camp, would you agree?”</p><p>“Huh? Who’s Uncle Song?” asked Tom Reggie, confused.</p><p>“His real name is Song Guanghui, a life-and-death sworn brother of my old man.” Tang Xiu pointed to Song Guanghui and explained. “That’s why I told you that he’s truly someone from my circle in the truest sense.”</p><p>Eyes with incredulity and shock, Tom Reggie stared at Song Guanghui. Even in his wildest dreams, he never thought that Sen Hui would have another name. It was even highly likely that he had some other identities.</p><p>“Tang Xiu didn’t lie. My real name is Song Guanghui, and I was once an elite commando for the special forces in China,” narrated Song Guanghui in a deep voice. “Later on, a certain accident happened, and I deserted the army. Then, I came to Saipan and have been living here under a new name while climbing the ladder to arrive at my current position now.”</p><p>Tom Reggie instantly understood why Tang Xiu said that he had very deep relations with Sen Hui. They were both Chinese, and Sen Hui was even a sworn brother to Tang Xiu’s father.</p><p>“Tom, there’s something I must say, though I think you should already know it,” said Tang Xiu. “The force under my control is very formidable, while what you know about me is just the tip of the iceberg. So now, I’m going to give you a chance. Be my subordinate.”</p><p>With a changed complexion, Tom Reggie glanced at Spectre standing beside Tang Xiu and asked with a sour face, “Do I have the right to refuse?”</p><p>“No, you don’t.” Tang Xiu shook his head, “It’s because any connection between me and Uncle Song must be strictly kept confidential for the time being, as well as the issue of Spectre becoming my man. A proper saying for the current situation is that the more you know, the more dangerous the situation will be. You now know something about me, so you only have two choices to avoid trouble.”</p><p>Two choices?</p><p>Tom Reggie was perfectly aware of what the two choices would be. The first one would be to submit to Tang Xiu and became his subordinate, resulting in him keeping his life, while the second would be him to be killed right here and now for refusing.</p><p>He didn’t believe that he had what it took to escape if he refused. Aside from Tang Xiu who was a very powerful man himself, just Spectre alone was someone he wouldn’t be able to face.</p><p>‘What should I do? Is submitting to Tang Xiu the only choice I have?’</p><p>Looking at the uncertain and gloomy expression on Tom Reggie’s face, Tang Xiu indifferently said, “You can rest assured that your wealth will still be yours even if you choose to submit to me. I won’t give you too many orders either, and even will give you rewards the more you accomplish things for me. I remember that I once told you that maybe you’ll be as strong as Awen someday.”</p><p>Tom Reggie seemed to be moved and asked, “You’re going to teach me Chinese Kung fu?”</p><p>“What Chinese Kung fu?” Tang Xiu shook his head. “What I can teach you is something different entirely, something that is beyond your imagination. Of course, the situation you’ll face will also become more dangerous once you’ve become very formidable. It is highly likely that the enemies you’ll face will no longer be ordinary humans.”</p><p>“Not humans? What are they? Are they the likes of those fierce beasts in the sea?” asked Tom Reggie with a confused face.</p><p>“Heh, those fierce ocean beasts are indeed very strong, but the enemies you’ll face in the future may be much stronger than they are,” sneered Tang Xiu. “Let me give you a comparison. You also know the likes of vampires, as well as demi-humans including the Beastmen, Wingmen, sorcerers, and wizards from the Western world, no?”</p><p>Stricken with shock, Tom Reggie asked, “You mean, I have a chance to be as powerful as those terrifying monsters and even will have them as my enemies?”</p><p>“You think these vampires, Beastmen, Wingmen, and wizards are powerful? Hmph!” Tang Xiu let out a contemptuous snort and said, “You prove your loyalty to me, and you’ll have the power to smash them in the future. But the enemies I’m telling you about are a much more powerful existence than them.”</p><p>Tom Reggie was dumbfounded. He never imagined that Tang Xiu could actually say such a claim. It was like Tang Xiu presented a window in front of him. Now, he was waiting for him to reach his hand out to open it and see the magical and mystical world beyond.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
