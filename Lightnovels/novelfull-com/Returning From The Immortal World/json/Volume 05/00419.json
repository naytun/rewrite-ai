She received a phone call from Jingmen Island’s Everlasting Feast Hall HQ and immediately returned there.</p><p>However, just as she arrived at the airport, she got another call, instructing her to stay there, since Elder Ji Chimei would arrive in Shanghai today.</p><p>Chi Nan didn’t understand why Elder Ji Chimei was coming to Shanghai now while the Boss himself wasn’t there. However, since Elder Ji’s status was extremely high, she must prepare a reception.</p><p>Creak...</p><p>A taxi stopped in front of Chi Nan. As the car’s door opened, Tang Xiu got off and then asked, “Has Ji Chimei come yet?”</p><p>Chi Nan was stunned upon seeing Tang Xiu. However, she responded in an instant, “Elder Ji hasn’t yet arrived, Boss.”</p><p>“All right. Prepare something for me to eat.” Tang Xiu nodded and said, “When Ji Chimei arrives, take her to see me immediately.”</p><p>“Yes!” Chi Nan respectfully nodded.</p><p>Half an hour later, Tang Xiu was full, and Ji Chimei had arrived. Inside the General Manager’s Office, Tang Xiu then took out the Demonic Revival Grass from his interspatial ring, handing it over to Ji Chimei and saying, “I never imagined that there would be a Demonic Revival Grass on Earth. I spent some effort and finally found it. So, you will take care of this, and there must not be any mistakes in guarding it.”</p><p>Demonic Revival Grass?</p><p>After receiving a phone call from Tang Xiu, Ji Chimei immediately left for Shanghai, yet she was still confused inwardly. At this time, she finally understood Tang Xiu’s purpose in making her come. With disbelief in her eyes, she took the Demonic Revival Grass with hands slightly trembling.</p><p>Bam…</p><p>Ji Chimei knelt before Tang Xiu and excitedly said, “Thank you, Venerable Lord.”</p><p>Tang Xiu helped her up. Shaking his head, he said, “You don’t need to thank me. In fact, it is I who must thank you, since Yan’er is my disciple, to begin with. Regardless, you’ve been loyal and protected her for so many years... I owe you too much.”</p><p>After Ji Chimei stood and put the Demonic Revival Grass in her interspatial ring, she shook her head and said, “Lord, you saved the life of us, the Mesmer Clan. Master herself also rescued my life before. So it’s my duty to protect her.”</p><p>“Well, you just arrived at Shanghai.” Tang Xiu nodded and said, “Go have some rest if you’re tired. If you’re not, you can go back to Jingmen Island earlier. Besides, it’s not good for you to be away for too long since Yan’er still in coma.”</p><p>“Understood. I’ll return immediately.” Ji Chimei reverentially said.</p><p>After Ji Chimei left, Chi Nan walked into the office with a curious expression, “Boss, Elder Ji has yet to eat, why did she leave in such a hurry?”</p><p>“She has some urgent matters and must return quickly.” Tang Xiu said.</p><p>“Do you have any other instructions, Boss?” Chi Nan nodded and asked again.</p><p>“No, I’ll rest now.” Tang Xiu shook his head and said, “By the way, what’s today’s date?”</p><p>“It’s the 21st today.” Chi Nan replied with a smile.</p><p>The 21st?</p><p>Tang Xiu dazed for a moment and immediately said with a smile, “I came back in time luckily. Seems like Shanghai University’s military training for new students should be over tomorrow. All right, I’ll rest until the day after tomorrow. The new term formally starts three days from now.”</p><p>“I think it wouldn’t matter if you were a day late, right?” Chi Nan smiled.</p><p>“I didn’t participate in the military training, after all. If I skip class again, it would unacceptable. Anyhow, how’s Xue Chao doing?” Tang Xiu said.</p><p>Chi Nan nodded and said, “He’s good. Upright, honest, and diligent. Our people love their family.”</p><p>“That’s great, then. Xue Chao should go back to school as well. Arrange for his wife and son to stay here! They will be in your care.” Tang Xiu said.</p><p>“Understood!”</p><p>Chi Nan nodded. Suddenly, an hesitant look appeared on her face, as she asked in an undertone voice, “Boss, the HQ in Jingmen Island originally asked me to go back. However, since Elder Ji was coming, they asked to stay here and wait for her. But now that she left, I…”</p><p>“Then arrange things here first and then go to Jingmen Island.” Tang Xiu nodded and said, “Anyways, have you managed to gather anything good these past few days? If you have, give them to Ji Chimei and she will give you the corresponding cultivation resources.”</p><p>“Yes!” Chi Nan was elated and replied quickly.</p><p>Soon, Tang Xiu left the Everlasting Feast Hall and went back to his villa in Bluestar Villa Complex. After hard working for so many days, he was finally able to relax. However, he then recalled that he hadn’t returned back to Star City, neither had he visited the Magnificent Tang Corp nor held the celebration feast for the company’s executives. He decided to rest for the night and then return to Star City tomorrow.</p><p>The next morning.</p><p>When Tang Xiu was still asleep, his cell phone rang. He didn’t expect that the one calling was Yuan Chuling, who hadn’t been in touch him for a long time.</p><p>“Where are you, Eldest Brother?” Yuan Chuling called out from the other end.</p><p>“I’m in Shanghai! Where are you, buddy?” Tang Xiu laughed.</p><p>“Damn, of course, I know you’re in Shanghai!” Yuan Chuling said loudly, “What I meant is, the military training ends today. I heard that the first group of Shanghai University’s students had already taken the bus to their campus. My campus’ military training ended a day earlier than yours, so I have three days of holiday. Where are you now? I wanna go to your place.”</p><p>“In Bluestar Villa Complex. Come here directly!” Tang Xiu said.</p><p>“How come you’re living there?” Yuan Chuling was surprised and said, “I heard that the villa complex is great. One of my classmates’ family lives there.”</p><p>“Cut the crap, will ya? Get your ass here fast!” Tang Xiu laughed and said, “After you’ve arrived at the complex’s entrance, tell the security that you’re looking for me.”</p><p>“Got it. Wait for me there!”</p><p>As the call ended, Tang Xiu looked at the time. It was 6:30 AM. He didn’t feel sleepy now, so he dressed up, washed his face and brushed his teeth, then strolled outside the villa complex, looking for a breakfast stall. As he strolled back into complex, Yuan Chuling called again.</p><p>“I’m already here, Eldest Brother!”</p><p>It was quite a distance from Tang Xiu’s position to the complex’s entrance. Arriving there, he saw the chubby Yuan Chuling holding a mobile phone and talking with two security guards.</p><p>\"I'm behind you, wait for me.\"</p><p>Hanging up the phone, Tang Xiu saw Yuan Chuling turn his head and immediately raised his hand to wave. Stopping in front of him, he looked at his round belly and grinned, “Buddy, why does your belly look even bigger than when you were in high school? Ain’t the military training hard?”</p><p>Yuan Chuling grinned and chuckled, “The military is full of bitter hardships indeed, but I got good meals there too! I don’t know what happened, though. I kinda have a good appetite recently. All right, let’s not talk about this. How can you stay in a place like this, brother?”</p><p>“I live here!” Tang Xiu smiled.</p><p>“You bought a villa here?” Yuan Chuling was amazed.</p><p>“It’s a gift from a relative.” Tang Xiu smiled and said, “Let’s go in. Anyway, I’ll be going back to Star City in a few days.”</p><p>Yuan Chuling followed alongside Tang Xiu. After entering the villa complex, he curiously asked, “What are you going back to Star City for? Also, did you say a relative of yours gifted you the villa? Who could be so generous?”</p><p>“Like I told you, why can’t I look exactly like the other 100,000 people out there?” Tang Xiu laughed and said, “Anyways, tell me about yourself. Why didn’t you contact me if you’ve been in Shanghai for such a long time? Don’t tell me you hooked up with an alien chick?”</p><p>“Did you send someone to investigate me or something, Eldest Brother?” Yuan Chuling was astonished and said, “How did you know I picked up a girl?”</p><p>Tang Xiu was speechless. He didn’t expect that Yuan Chuling would actually hang out with a belle. The reason why he said that was because of Yue Kai’s and Hu Qingsong’s influence.</p><p>As they arrived at the villa, Yuan Chuling toured inside and then ran back to the living room in the first floor. As he saw Tang Xiu sitting on the sofa and smoking, he sighed in praise, “You’ve got yourself good here, Brother. Thus, I decided to reserve a room so I that can bring the belle over. At least I can save the money. Do remember to leave a room reserved for me, okay?”</p><p>“Go to hell!” Tang Xiu chided, “You’re a second generation nouveau-riche yourself, why don’t you beg your Dad one if you want it so much?”</p><p>Sitting at the opposite side of Tang Xiu, Yuan Chuling grinned, “You’ve changed, buddy. You’ve become a miser now, that’s not good. So you gotta pay for my flight ticket to Star City to compensate my wounded soul.”</p><p>“You’re also going back to Star City?” Tang Xiu couldn’t help laughing.</p><p>“Actually, I have some serious things in mind, so I came to you today.” Yuan Chuling chuckled and said with a smile, “It’s my old man. He ordered me to invite you when you go back. He said that there are some things he needs to discuss with you.”</p><p>“What matters does your father want to discuss with me?” Tang Xiu was confused.</p><p>Yuan Chuling shrugged and shook his head, saying, “You ask me, but whom should I ask? He still provides me money, yet he doesn’t want me to be involved in the family business. But you, he’s been calling me several times recently, and asking about you every time.”</p><p>After pondering for a while, Tang Xiu then nodded and said, “Let’s go back now then! It’s just that I need to go back to Star City since I got things to do there as well.”</p><p>“No hurry, dude. I have another thing I wanted to say.” Yuan Chuling waved his hand.</p><p>“What else?” Tang Xiu asked.</p><p>“Brother, this time, aside from my old man’s order, the most important thing is that I want you to become my business partner.” Yuan Chuling chuckled and said with a smile, “I have quite a sum of money and I want to set up a grand business. Hence, hehe…”</p><p>Tang Xiu rolled his eyes and said, “Do you think I’m rich or something? Besides, we’re still students, to begin with. What kind of business do you want to mess with, exactly? Do you even have time to manage it?”</p><p>Erasing the smile on his face, Yuan Chuling then said with all seriousness, “You’re definitely a rich man. At least, you are several thousand richer than I am. If anything, just listen to my plan first. If you think it’s feasible, then invest your money in me. If you feel it’s not good, then I’ll give some more thought to it.”</p><p>“Then, tell me, what is this business you wanna do?” Tang Xiu said.</p><p>“Well, it’s like this, Eldest Brother. After I’ve been to Shanghai, I’ve been kind of living in the world of wine and women ever since. I then unintentionally found something for the first time. You, too, know that life in the metropolis is very fast nowadays. A great deal of wage earners works every day after opening their eyes from sleep. After that, they spent their time in the nightlife, thus they are in the borderline between health and illness. So I was thinking to open a large Fitness Center in Shanghai.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
