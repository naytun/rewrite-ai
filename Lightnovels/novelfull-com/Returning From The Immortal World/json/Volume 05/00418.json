However, several fierce beasts were struck and severely injured as they fell to the ground.</p><p>The two giant pythons who were about to rush into the cave also realized the unusual situation behind them at this moment. Their cold eyes looked started. After momentarily stopping they turned to flee.</p><p>Fire was their nemesis!</p><p>At this time, Li Laoshan and Ji Shiyan, who were inside the cave, as well as the two bodyguards, also saw the scene outside. They were originally panic-stricken because of the fight, but the lightning flash and the overspread raging fire made them dumbfounded and hesitating.</p><p>What happened? Where did the lighting come from? From where did the flame appear?</p><p>At that moment, Tang Xiu’s figure finally sprinted into the cave entrance. His eyes were cold as he shouted to the four, “Abandon everything! Come with me now, immediately! Shit… there are too many fierce beasts here, and I can’t kill them all. I can’t stay here to protect you, either.”</p><p>\"Tang Xiu?\"</p><p>\"Brother Tang?\"</p><p>Ji Shiyan and Li Laoshan exclaimed loudly after seeing that it was Tang Xiu.</p><p>“Stop talking! Come out and follow me! We only have one way to escape. Whether we can escape or not will depend on your luck.” Tang Xiu shouted loudly.</p><p>Li Laoshan, Ji Shiyan, and the two bodyguards trembled. Shock and fright was all over their faces. They quickly came to Tang Xiu’s side. While looking at the dissipating trail of lightning and watching the gradually extinguishing flames, Li Laoshan hurriedly asked, “Brother Tang, what the hell are these monsters? They are too… too horrifying, completely invulnerable!”</p><p>“These are fierce beasts that have cultivated and turned into demonic beasts.” Tang Xiu replied in a heavy voice, “All right, I don’t have time to explain it to you. Follow me!”</p><p>While talking, Tang Xiu took the lead. Taking advantage that the fierce beasts were fleeing, he led the four to quickly escape. A few minutes later, a new situation caused Tang Xiu to turn quite helpless, as dozens of fierce beasts seemed to have reacted to them, following their tracks and chasing after them.</p><p>“You all run and escape through the old route. I’ll guard the rear.”</p><p>Tang Xiu took a few Kindle Flame Symbols and slowed his speed.</p><p>Ji Shiyan and the two bodyguards didn’t slow down, but Li Laoshan shouted, “Brother Tang, let’s go together! If we have to fight and this old Fatty must die, then I must die fighting together with you.”</p><p>“JUST GO!” Tang Xiu angrily shouted, “I don’t need you to fight by my side. You are too weak, you’ll only be a burden if you stay with me.”</p><p>“I…”</p><p>Li Laoshan clenched his teeth and unwillingly sped up.</p><p>Tang Xiu held Bloodguzzler in one hand, while his other held a few Kindle Flame Symbols. He looked at the dozen or so fierce beasts that approached. Without hesitation, he activated the Kindle Flame Symbols. In an instant, a sea of flames formed and the trees in the surrounding suddenly lit up.</p><p>And he... he turned away and fled without hesitation.</p><p>Roar…</p><p>Auooo…</p><p>The pack of fierce beasts was forced to retreat because the flames, however, several beasts who didn’t fear death dashed into the sea of fire. At the same time they withstood the raging fire, a blue mist sprayed from their mouths, scattering and extinguishing the fire.</p><p>After Tang Xiu catching up with Li Laoshan and Ji Shiyan, he immediately caught the duo’s shoulders. As his speed increased, they quickly disappeared into the distant woods. Two minutes afterward, Tang Xiu had carried the two for more than several kilometers.</p><p>“Keep running. I’ll pick them up!”</p><p>After releasing them, Tang Xiu turned back without hesitation. He then saw the two bodyguards fleeing with dozens of beasts on their tail.</p><p>\"GO!\"</p><p>The moment Tang Xiu grabbed their arms, he ran away without hesitation. He also used his mind to control two Kindle Flame Symbols to explode, blocking their path.</p><p>Time fleeted by, and after half an hour, all the Kindle Flame Symbols in Tang Xiu’s interspatial ring were used. He had brought the four to escape for dozens of kilometers and crossed two mountains.</p><p>“Brother Tang, it should be alright now, right?”</p><p>Li Laoshan looked ghastly pale as he panted. At this moment, his legs were as heavy as if they were filled with lead. He felt like he would lose his legs and die of exhaustion if he were to run anymore.</p><p>Ji Shiyan and the two bodyguards were not much better than Li Laoshan at the moment. If not because they were escaping for their lives, they would not have managed to get this far.</p><p>Tang Xiu didn’t reply for a while, as he then gritted his teeth and said, “NO! If any of these ferocious evil beasts come after us, I can’t protect all of you. We must continue!”</p><p>Saying that, he once again grabbed Li Laoshan and Ji Shiyan’s arms and started running. This time, he sprinted for about ten minutes before stopping at the summit of a mountaintop. Then, he returned to fetch the two bodyguards. After which, he returned, sitting down with a pale complexion.</p><p>It was deathly silence.</p><p>Amid the blowing cool breeze, the way Li Laoshan, Ji Shiyan, and the two bodyguards looked at Tang Xiu was completely different from before. Previously, they only admired him, but now it had already changed into reverence.</p><p>What Tang Xiu had shown them tonight was something they were unable to describe except as shocking. That magical lightning and flames seemed to appear out of nowhere. What they could only see on TV, the power of magic.</p><p>Furthermore, Tang Xiu’s speed was beyond human limits. They had never imagined that a human could run so fast. That speed could no longer be described as running, it was simply like… flying.</p><p>Additionally, those fierce beasts were just like monsters. They could spray out strange things from their mouths.</p><p>Shortly put! What they witnessed and experienced tonight made the realize that there were indeed mysterious things in this world which they never knew or seen before. In their eyes, Tang Xiu had turned into an extraordinary existence who only existed in legends, an expert with supernatural powers.</p><p>“We mustn’t stay long in this place. Let’s rest for a while, and then we must hit the road again.” After resting for a few minutes, Tang Xiu then finally spoke.</p><p>“Brother Tang, we’ll do what you say. But can you answer me, how did you do that?” Li Laoshan asked.</p><p>“Fatty Li, there are things you don’t need to know. Even if you know, you can never come in contact with this kind of matter, as it’ll only make you restless and worry otherwise.” Tang Xiu said lightly, “If anything, I hope you forget everything you’ve seen and heard tonight, let alone disclose it to others.”</p><p>“We mustn't tell anyone, including our relatives?” Li Laoshan quickly asked.</p><p>“You can’t!” Tang Xiu shook his head and said, “Consider it as your repayment for me saving your lives.”</p><p>A glint flashed in Ji Shiyan’s eyes as she directly said, “I’ll never speak even half a word about it, Mr. Tang.”</p><p>The two bodyguards exchanged glances. It was because of Tang Xiu they survived tonight, thus, they gratefully promised, “We’ll never say anything about today as well, Mr. Tang.”</p><p>Tang Xiu nodded and then looked at Li Laoshan.</p><p>“Since Brother Tang wishes it, then I naturally won’t speak about it as well.” Li Laoshan forced a smile and said, “Nevertheless, what I have experienced tonight was too great an impact. I’m afraid I’ll have to calm down a bit after leaving this place.”</p><p>“As a matter of fact, even if you speak out about tonight’s matter, it will have some impact on you too.” Tang Xiu nodded and said, “Besides, the public will never believe what you say either. Perhaps even some people from a certain special department in the country will appear before you if you were to make a disturbance out of this matter. Thus, you keeping silent will only benefit you.”</p><p>Special department?</p><p>Li Laoshan and the three others’ expression moved and they nodded simultaneously.</p><p>Shortly after, everyone rested for nearly an hour before continuing to trek. However, it was already late so they still inevitably encountered some wild animals, though Tang Xiu discovered it timely, either avoiding, killing or driving them away. In short order they had climbed over two hills, before stopping and fully resting.</p><p>The sun began to rise from the eastern side of the mountain.</p><p>Sitting cross-legged on a boulder, Tang Xiu then looked at the four sleeping like logs. He was particularly excited inwardly. In order to completely heal Gu Yan’er, the Chrono Crystal and the Demonic Revival Grass were needed, and he now had obtained the Demonic Revival Grass, so there was only the Chrono Crystal left.</p><p>Yet, Tang Xiu held no hope of finding the Chrono Crystal on Earth. Finding the Demonic Revival Grass was already huge luck in itself. Moreover, not only did he obtained the Demonic Revival Grass this time, he also got the Soul Phantasmagoria Demonic Flower. If he wanted to injure someone in the future without anyone noticing it, he could use the Soul Phantasmagoria Demonic Flower.</p><p>At noon.</p><p>Tang Xiu woke the others. Even if they hadn’t fully rested, he didn’t want to stay in Shennong Ridge any longer. Therefore, he led them to continue trekking. Finally, everyone arrived at the foot of the mountains at the outermost edge of Shennong Ridge in the middle of the night.</p><p>“I’m really sorry, Brother Tang.”</p><p>As the six black SUVs came to fetch them up, Li Laoshan stood in front of a car and said with a forced, bitter smile.</p><p>“Fatty Li, why are you suddenly saying this?” Tang Xiu doubtfully asked.</p><p>“Well, originally I wanted to help you, yet, I become your burden.” Li Laoshan forced a smile and said, “I didn’t find the medicinal herbs you were looking for either. Anyhow, you can rest assured that I’ll remember this matter. After I leave, I’ll lead some more people later to go there and help you find it.”</p><p>“Fatty Li, I’ve actually found the medicinal herb I need. I didn’t tell you because you didn’t ask.” Tang Xiu waved his hand and said, “Hence, you don’t have to worry about it anymore. You too have experienced the dangers of Shennong Ridge. I’m afraid you would be unable to return even if you bring more people there later. Listen to me! Do not enter Shennong Ridge again, let alone Ghost King Valley.”</p><p>“You’ve found it? Why can’t I see it?” Li Laoshan was surprised.</p><p>“Relax!” Tang Xiu chuckled and said, “I don’t need to lie to you, do I? Anyhow, where are you heading now?”</p><p>“Two of my bodyguards are dead, so I have to handle their funeral affairs.” Li Laoshan said, “In addition, I’ll have to sign the cooperation contract with the Yellowsteel Group as well, thus, I will go back soon. What about you? Where are you headed now?”</p><p>“I’m going back to Shanghai!” Tang Xiu said with a smile.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
