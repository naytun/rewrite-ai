He also shot a look at Chen Si’en, whose complexion was pale and hostilely glaring at him. He never imagined that the farce would turn at him. He reluctantly shook his head before reaching out to pick Andy up, “Andy, don’t mess around. There are many onlookers here. Let’s go inside! The banquet is about to begin.”</p><p>“All right!”</p><p>Despite feeling disappointed, Andy didn’t show a sliver of it outwardly. Under the onlookers watchful eyes, she held Kang Xia’s hand and lightly smiled. “Boss, my performance just now was great, wasn’t it? Not only did I reject and swat that fly, but I also confessed my love to the man I like. I’m amazing, right?”</p><p>“Bah, you were simply making trouble on purpose.” Kang Xia forced a smile. “Be careful, girl. Boss might kick you away.”</p><p>“Heh, no way. I’m Boss’ loving, trusted confidante. He will definitely hate to part with me.” Andy’s makeup filled face made a scoffing expression as she giggled, “If anything, you don’t need to feel jealous of me, Chief.”</p><p>Kang Xia rolled her eyes at her and then strode forward.</p><p>Already with an unsightly expression on his face, Chen Si’en’s face turned uglier after hearing Andy comparing him to fly. Right as Tang Xiu’s group was almost inside, he immediately pursued to block them. Glaring at Tang Xiu, he growled, “Who the hell are you?”</p><p>Tang Xiu halted as he looked at the furious Chen Si’en, and then lightly said, “You don’t need to know. You only need to know that venting your anger on others because you got rejected is not something you should do. The relationship between Andy and I is normal. If anything, continue pursuing her if you got the ability. But if you wanna give up, that’s nothing to do with me whatsoever.”</p><p>Relaxing a bit, Chen Si’en still stubbornly said, “How the hell this has nothing to do with you? Didn’t you just saw and heard her? I like her! I’ve fallen in love with her. She’s destined to be my woman in this lifetime. You had better leave her and go far away and stop appearing in front of her again if you know what’s good for you.”</p><p>“Buddy, let me tell you one thing. It’s your damn business whether you’re successful or not in pursuing her.” Tang Xiu’s face turned cold, as he said in a heavy tone, “Regardless, you neither have the rights to dictate how others manage their lives nor are you qualified to limit how others get along with each other.”</p><p>“That’s my business. I’ll take care of it! What the fuck can you do anyway?” Chen Si’en scowled angrily.</p><p>A cold light flashed in Tang Xiu’s eyes as his eyes narrowed to slits. He coldly said, “Your name is Chen Si’en? I was just thinking that you were a good young man; I would even regard you as half of my own people if you were able to get Andy. But now my impression has turned to the worst. You had better get lost before I get angry.”</p><p>Clenching his fists tightly, Chen Si’en replied back overbearingly, “Arrogant! And really overbearing! You’re the first one to dare to be so arrogant before me. Kid, no matter who you are, I’ll make you pay if you dare to appear before Andy again.”</p><p>\"You are beyond hopeless!\" Tang Xiu shook his head as he looked at Andy and asked, “That skill I imparted to you, how’s your practice?”</p><p>After angrily glaring at Chen Si’en, Andy then looked at Tang Xiu. Acting like a child who had done something wrong, she lowered her head and said, “I’m much stronger and my speed is a lot faster as well. It seems that... seems like I’ve succeeded.”</p><p>Tang Xiu had just seen himself realized that Andy’s physical condition was stronger than before. Hence, he inquired about that. After getting the answer he wanted, he indifferently said, “This matter was caused by you; solve it yourself. I don’t want to him here in the next two minutes.”</p><p>“Understood, Boss!”</p><p>Andy replied and then glared at Chen Si’en, angrily saying, “Did you hear it? My Boss doesn’t want to see you again, scram!”</p><p>Perplexed, Chen Si’en anxiously said, “Andy, I’m really sincere. Don’t you want to have a well-off life? My Chen family have big a enterprise and is wealthy. I can assure you that you can live a rich, full life if you follow me. Likewise, I was just muddle headed out of anger just now. But I recall you calling him Boss before, so he must be the Magnificent Tang Corp’s Boss, right? You can relax, my Chen Family is tens of times stronger than the Magnificent Tang Corp. Marry me, and later you’ll be the Chens’ daughter-in-law; you won’t need to do anything. You’ll be 10 thousand times better than working at the Magnificent Tang Corp.”</p><p>Bam…</p><p>A small fist fiercely punched Chen Si’en’s face. Staggering, Chen Si’en almost fell to the floor. The instant Andy’s feet landed on the floor, she angrily shouted, “No one allowed you to slander our Magnificent Tang Corp, Chen Si’en! What Chen Family? If my Boss wants it, he can make a company more powerful than your Simao Group. Scram! You only have a minute left!”</p><p>Chen Si’en stared at Andy in disbelief. In his eyes, Andy had always been an angel; a pure, chaste, and flawless angel. Never once in his dreams had he thought that one day she would beat him to keep another man’s company under the public’s watchful eyes.</p><p>Blazing fury was bred from the flames of anger inside of him.</p><p>Glaring fixedly at Andy, he clenched his fists tightly. Had it not been for the fact that Andy was a woman, he would have acted already. Suddenly, as though recalling something, he turned around and immediately raised his fist and bolted toward Tang Xiu, attempting to vent his anger and giving Tang Xiu a lesson by force.</p><p>Andy’s countenance changed and her expression turned unsightly. Her speed was very fast as she quickly blocked Chen Si’en’s path. Her petite body suddenly leaped up as her proud peaks were akin to roaring waves. She then punched Chen Si’en’s face again, yet at this time, she exerted enough power to directly smash Chen Si’en down.</p><p>Hiss…</p><p>More and more guests joined the onlookers watching. Many of those who came later inquired about the whole story. Some showed sympathy, while others pity. Nevertheless, the following script made many of them despise Chen Si’en, since he actually lost his demeanor and vented his anger on another just because he was rejected. After all, the man he vented his anger at had been polite toward him, even making it clear that he was only an ordinary friend to the girl. Still, Chen Si’en actually vehemently ignored it.</p><p>When everyone saw Andy act out of anger, they shook their heads, lamenting and sighing for Chen Si’en, for he had to bear the consequences for his own deeds, allowing himself to be beaten down.</p><p>However, the second time Andy acted, as she jumped to punch Chen Si’en and making him fall to the floor, everyone couldn’t help but gasp. They were secretly shocked by Andy’s strength and speed, as it was beyond their imagination. However, the previous shock had yet to dissipate when a more unexpected scene occurred that made them more perplexed.</p><p>Andy strode toward Chen Si’en and repeatedly kicked him on the floor. Furthermore, it seemed that Andy was exerting a great deal of strength, since he kept screaming pitifully with every kick.</p><p>Flawless beautiful face and a petite figure.</p><p>She was akin to a flawlessly pure angel. Yet, that cute little angel who everyone couldn’t help but be fond of turned out to be unbelievably violent.</p><p>This… was she a violent angel?</p><p>Tang Xiu couldn’t help but sigh inside. Although he also felt that Chen Si’en was somewhat pitiful, yet the pitiful guy also had a hateful side to him. If it wasn’t because the guy himself threw a tantrum to flame him, he wouldn’t have been angry at him.</p><p>At the end of the day, however, Andy was an employee of the Magnificent Tang Corp; it was rather an unsightly misconduct for her to savagely beat Chen Si’en under everyone’s watchful eyes. Hence, he let out a light cough and called her out, “Andy, stop!”</p><p>After Andy stopped, the indignant expression on her face vanished in an instant. She was like an obedient wife as she came toward Tang Xiu and said in a low voice, “Boss!”</p><p>Shaking his head, Tang Xiu then glanced at Chen Si’en, who was holding his belly and curled up on the floor like a dried up shrimp. Then, he calmly said, “Just forget it! After all, he likes you, and it’s not wrong for anyone to like someone, to begin with. Come, our company’s party is about to start. Don’t delay it because of this trivial matter.”</p><p>“Yes, yes!”</p><p>Seeing that Tang Xiu didn’t even blame her, Andy quickly ran to Kang Xia’s side and grabbed her arm again.</p><p>At the moment, Kang Xia’s expression was a bit weird. Seeing Tang Xiu turn around and walk inside, she hesitated for a moment, before entering Long’s Dining Hall’s front door. She then asked in a low voice, “Andy, your cultivation … could it be your cultivation has produced True Primordial Qi?”</p><p>“Yeah, my cultivation has achieved it some time ago, Chief!” Andy chuckled and said, “But I didn’t tell you because you left for Shanghai. After coming back, we got too busy and I forgot to mention it. At present, not only can I feel the flow of qi inside my body, but I also can control it. Besides, Boss has imparted us the cultivation technique to practice; absorbing some Spiritual Qi, and then transforming it to True Primordial Qi.”</p><p>Kang Xia secretly gasped and gulped her saliva down. She then lightly asked, “Are your strength and speed really more powerful than before?”</p><p>“They are several times stronger than before, at least.” Andy nodded and said, “Otherwise, how do you think I was able to punch Chen Si’en’s face so fiercely?”</p><p>“I’m really envious of you, girl.” Kang Xia forced a smile and said, “I haven’t even felt the flow of qi till now! Yet, you are already able to control it; even transforming it into True Primordial Qi.”</p><p>“That’s because you are usually too busy and rarely practice, right, Chief?” Andy laughed and said, “I think it’s not difficult to practice! I usually cultivate for two hours in the morning and in the daytime if I got the time, hence I naturally succeeded.”</p><p>Kang Xia stared blankly for a moment, before she shook her head and forced out a bitter smile. She was indeed like Andy said. More often than not, she was too busy to even have a proper meal, where would she have the time to cultivate? The best shot she could give was to cultivate consecutively for a week, and that was only two hours each day.</p><p>She secretly made up her mind to cultivate diligently later. After all, it was Boss who had imparted her the cultivation technique. Even if her cultivation was not as powerful as Boss told them, but at least she didn’t want to be inferior to Andy.</p><p>“Andy, you have worked hard! But I’ll definitely surpass you later.” Kang Xia whispered.</p><p>“I’ll be waiting, Chief.” Andy chuckled.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
