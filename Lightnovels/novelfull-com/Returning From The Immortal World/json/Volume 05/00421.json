He then nodded and said, “I know that you and your mother have suffered quite a lot during those years. Even though our situation is getting better each passing day, she doesn’t slow down for fear that those bitter days will yet come again if she doesn’t save some money.”</p><p>Tang Xiu nodded and suddenly said, “Dad, have you considered about the matter we talked about before? What are you going to do now?”</p><p>“I’ve been thinking about several projects recently, but I haven’t decided yet.” Tang Yunde said.</p><p>“What projects?”</p><p>“One of them is a hotel business. With Shuangqing Province’s economic level getting higher and the more convenient transportation means to other provinces in China, I realized that I can do a hotel business. Only, it would be difficult to start in a large-scale. Another one is real estate business. Although there are many real estate developers in the country, the housing problem is still the top priority given the increasing population. Additionally, there’s also the goods distribution business, where online shopping is very prosperous nowadays. Retail business is also quite significant.”</p><p>After pondering for a while, Tang Xiu suddenly said, “Dad, I think I’ll also set up a hotel business. But I think investing large-scale straightaway in this business field in Shuangqing province is not necessarily good. You might as well take a closer look at some cities with highly developed tourism aspect, such as coastal cities…”</p><p>Tang Yunde’s eyes lit up as he patted his thigh and said, “You’re right, sonny. With the improving standard of life and the booming tourism industry, establishing hotels near scenic areas is certainly good. Anyhow, what about the other two options? What do you think?”</p><p>“I think you can forget about going into real estate business.” Tang Xiu said, “There are many construction companies all over the country nowadays, and quite formidable ones as well, whether it is in a big city or some remote area. Competing with them will not be easy. The retail industry, however, is still feasible. But I need to know how big you want it to be.”</p><p>“I can come up with two billion.” Tang Yunde said.</p><p>Pondering for a while, Tang Xiu then let out a smile and said, “Let’s set up a hotel business first, and then invest in the retail business. There are only a few large retail companies in the country. So, if you can set up a large retail company, and we can open all sort of logistic channels, we can perhaps get huge profits from it.”</p><p>“What do you think about cooperating with others?” Tang Yunde asked.</p><p>“With whom?” Tang Xiu asked back.</p><p>“With a large logistic company, like injecting some funds and becoming shareholders.” Tang Yunde said.</p><p>After thinking for a while, Tang Xiu then shook his head and said, “It’s not feasible in my opinion. The large logistic companies must already have thorough logistic channels, and are also well-known. However big our funds are, it won’t be easy to compete against them. I think it may be best if we take over a small logistics company, and then invest large funds to start expanding broader logistics channels, spreading the distribution network to every part of the country, thus making our own complete channel network. On the one hand, we can ensure the security of the logistic route; and on the other hand, we can also guarantee the distribution speed. By the way, I’ve also bought several airplanes, so if you really want to do logistic business, I can give them to you after the reconstruction in Nine Dragons Island has been completed.”</p><p>“Really?” Tang Yunde’s eyes lit up and asked in astonishment.</p><p>“Surely you don’t think I’m joking?” Tang Xiu said with a smile.</p><p>“Your ideas are great!” Tang Xiu praised, “I’ve learned about the situation of a few large logistics companies in the country. Though they also have cargo planes, they are few in number.”</p><p>“If anything, as long as you provide the funds and go all out to invest them, any business will do, I think.” Tang Xiu said, “Though I still have some money in hand, they have already been allocated, so I can only help you in this.”</p><p>“I know you have the funds, son. But how can I use your money to fund my own business?” Tang Yunde laughed, “Anyhow, can you get me a batch of Gods Nectar?”</p><p>“You can contact Kang Xia for that. She will refuse if its anyone else but you.” Tang Xiu said, “Well, Dad, I have some things to handle, so I can’t accompany you anymore.”</p><p>“Didn’t you just come back?” Tang Yunde confused, “You’re leaving already? Where are you going now?”</p><p>“It’s the father of my classmate.” Tang Xiu smiled and said, “He said he has something to discuss with me, so I’m going to see him.”</p><p>“Are you coming back to dinner?” Tang Yunde asked with a smile.</p><p>“I can’t. I have an appointment tonight.” Tang Xiu shook his head and said, “Yuan Zhengxuan invited me to dinner, so I don’t have the time tonight.”</p><p>\"Yuan Zhengxuan?\"</p><p>Tang Yunde slightly blanked and looked surprised, as he asked, “Sonny, your classmate’s father is Yuan Zhengxuan, the Yuan Group’s Boss?”</p><p>“Yea! Do you know him?” Tang Xiu nodded.</p><p>“I’ve met him a few times.” Tang Yunde nodded and said, “Like me, he used to be in the army as well.”</p><p>“I’ve also heard about this. Even his current business has deep ties with the military.” Tang Xiu said, “Nonetheless, he told me a few months ago that he was seeking an opportunity to do other businesses. But I don’t know whether the matter he’s looking me for is related to this issue, though.”</p><p>“Fine, off you go then!” Tang Yunde nodded.</p><p>Tang Xiu quickly left South Gate Town without saying hello to his mother since she was still asleep. After driving his Land Rover SUV to the Yuan Family’s villa, Yuan Zhengxuan and Zhao Jing were very enthusiastic as they personally welcomed Tang Xiu to the study room. Inside, Yuan Zhengxuan enthusiastically said, “Tang Xiu, your Magnificent Tang Corp is becoming more and more prosperous and thriving!”</p><p>“Well, I don’t know much about the company’s management, though.” Tang Xiu modestly said, “It’s Kang Xia who usually takes care of it since my main task is studying.”</p><p>“To have a senior general manager such as Kang Xia working for you is really great luck, Tang Xiu.” Yuan Zhengxuan said, “I wouldn’t have anymore headaches if I were to have someone with such competencies.”</p><p>“Uncle Yuan, is there something you want to discuss with me?”</p><p>“You know that I’ve started to think about transforming my business some time ago. Thus, I’ve withdrawn quite a lot of funds recently.” Yuan Zhengxuan nodded and said, “I also made some investment in the New City project thanks to my relationship with you. However, I still have quite a lot of funds in hand, so I want to ask you whether there’s any business worth investing in?”</p><p>“Uncle Yuan, for you to have set up your business career from scratch, you’re definitely a capable person. Yet, you’re asking me about investment issues. It’s kind of making me awkward.” Tang Xiu couldn’t help laughing and said, “Speaking about it, you’re not the first one to ask me about investing today.”</p><p>“There was another? Who?” Yuan Zhengxuan was astonished.</p><p>“My father.” Tang Xiu smiled.</p><p>Perplexed, Yuan Zhengxuan said, “Your father? As far as I know, you seem to have been brought up by your mother, I haven’t heard about…”</p><p>“I’ve indeed grown up with my mother due to special reasons.” Tang Xiu said, “But lately, my father has come back and wants to do some businesses. Anyways, when I was chatting with him with him about investments, I mentioned you and he said that he has met you a few times!”</p><p>“Who’s your father?” Yuan Zhengxuan was surprised.</p><p>“Tang Yunde.” Tang Xiu said.</p><p>Tang Yunde?</p><p>The name gave a familiar vibe to Yuan Zhengxuan, yet he couldn’t remember where he had heard it. When he looked at Tang Xiu’s face, realization dawned on him. Tang Xiu’s face reminded him of someone. Due to remembering it, he got up all of a sudden and asked incredulously, “Your father is Tang Yunde? The once Soldier King in the army? And one of the Tangs in Beijing…”</p><p>“Yes!” Tang Xiu laughed.</p><p>Yuan Zhengxuan’s lips twitched a few times. Looking emotionally excited, he murmured, “Brother Tang is still alive? I met him 20 years ago, and his heroic spirit was unforgettable to me. Tang Xiu, where’s your father now? Can I meet him to drink a couple glasses of wine?”</p><p>“He’s in South Gate Town, Uncle Yuan.” Tang Xiu said with a smile, “You can go there directly if you want to see him.”</p><p>“I’ll visit him tonight.” Yuan Zhengxuan nodded repeatedly and said, “You might not be aware of it, Tang Xiu. But your father was once the pride of all the servicemen. He had been someone countless soldiers looked up to. Had it not been because of what happened that year, I dare say he would have become a general and someone with great authority in the army.”</p><p>Tang Xiu only let out a faint smile and didn’t reply.</p><p>“This is really unexpected.” Yuan Zhengxuan sighed again, “No, I never expected it! To think that you’re actually his son. No wonder you possess such capabilities despite your young age. A father tiger indeed won’t beget a dog son. Like father, like son!”</p><p>“Well, let’s not talk about this anymore, Uncle Yuan.” Tang Xiu waved his hand and said, “If your purpose to ask me over this time was merely for asking about investment issues, I’m afraid I can’t be of any help to you.”</p><p>“You definitely can!” A glint flashed in Yuan Zhengxuan’s eyes as he said, “I trust you can help me in this.”</p><p>“How come?” Tang Xiu was stunned.</p><p>“Didn’t you just say it? That your father also wants to do business?” Yuan Zhengxuan said with a smile, “I want to set up some business, so if the two of us cooperate…”</p><p>“Whether you two will eventually cooperate or not, I won’t interfere with that. If anything, you can talk with him directly, but don’t involve me in it.” Tang Xiu smiled and said, “By the way, Uncle Yuan… Yuan Chuling wants to open a fitness center in Shanghai. He has told you about it, I presume? As his father, are you going to support him?”</p><p>“He got support from you, so how can I not?” Yuan Zhengxuan laughed and said, “Little Ling has told me about everything you two have discussed. So I’ve also decided to give him 10 million as a starting kick. Even if he loses all the money, I don’t care. I’ll still support him as long as he gets to learn some skills from it.”</p><p>“That’s just like Uncle Yuan has just said, a tiger father won’t beget a dog son.” Tang Xiu gave him a thumbs up and praised, “Like father, like son. Worry not, Uncle Yuan! I’ll help you look after him and the fitness center. As long as he doesn’t deliberately create trouble, I’m sure there won’t be any problems.”</p><p>“That would be great!”</p><p>Yuan Zhengxuan nodded in satisfaction. It was actually these words that Yuan Zhengxuan had been waiting from Tang Xiu.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
