After all, both sides hadn’t truly signed the cooperation contract yet. If he were to hide this issue, it would be quite a hassle once the project launched.</p><p>“Let us put away this issue for now. But if this problem arises arises, do let me know, and I’ll solve it.”</p><p>With a happy expression, Jin Xingkui rubbed his hands and said, “I had no choice but telling you about this matter, Brother Tang. Please don’t blame me! But if I didn’t tell you in advance, just the construction project itself would be delayed later.”</p><p>“I’m glad you told me about this problem now. Anyways, let us not talk about this matter anymore. Give me the measurement data and survey of this site so I can be prepared after I go back,” said Tang Xiu with a smile.</p><p>“All right!”</p><p>Jin Xingkui motioned for the woman beside him, as she immediately opened her briefcase and handed Tang Xiu a document.</p><p>After receiving it, Tang Xiu said, “All right. Then I’ll go back first.”</p><p>“Why don’t we lunch together, Brother Tang?” Jin Xingkui quickly asked.</p><p>“No, I still have some matters to take care of,” replied Tang Xiu while waving his hand.</p><p>Afterward, Tang Xiu drove back to Bluestar Villa Complex. Just after he entered the house, he saw Ouyang Lulu and Zhang Xinya walked from the inside while holding hands. There was a smile on their faces, which evidently showed that their mood was quite pleasant.</p><p>“Hello, big star! We were wondering whether you’d come for lunch! Anyways, the meal was personally sent by the Everlasting Feast Hall’s Manager—Chi Nan, and they are already in the dining room!” Said Zhang Xinya with a smile.</p><p>After locking the car’s door, Tang Xiu replied with a smile, “Come on. It’s you who is a genuine big star, while my unwarranted reputation was due to a strange combination of circumstances. Besides, I don’t think anyone will remember me after a few days.”</p><p>“I dare say it won’t happen,” Zhang Xinya tenderly smiled. “Anyhow, my visit this time is because I’d like to invite you to be the special guest in my concert tomorrow evening.”</p><p>“No no no. Please let me out of this, will you?” Tang Xiu hastily waved his hand upon hearing it. “I’m afraid I’ll be in the headlines again the next day if I become the special guest in your concert. These days, I’ve already been living in deep distress, and I’ll really go crazy if things continue this way.”</p><p>“I really don’t get it, Tang Xiu. Others would do anything just to become famous. But you’re actually repugnant to becoming famous.” Zhang Xinya tenderly smiled. “Care to tell me the reason?”</p><p>“It’s because I like a quiet and tranquil life; I don’t like to be the focus of attention wherever I go. I prefer becoming rich without many disturbances in life,” said Tang Xiu.</p><p>“That idea of yours is kind of peculiar, you know.” Zhang Xinya couldn’t help chuckled. “But that’s fine as well. You can still make a big fortune even if you don’t rely on your fame. All right, tycoon Big Boss, shall we have lunch now? I’m afraid the food will become cold if we delay much longer.”</p><p>“Then let us eat!” Said Tang Xiu with a faint smile.</p><p>Accompanied by both good dishes and beauties, Tang Xiu savored as he eat crisply.</p><p>After having eaten and drank to his heart’s content, the two women picked up the leftovers and cleaned up the dishes. Just as Tang Xiu turned on his mobile, he received dozens of SMSs and missed calls’ notifications.</p><p>His complexion slightly changed after giving them a cursory look.</p><p>Among them were several missed calls and an SMS from Yuan Chuling.</p><p>Without a second thought, Tang Xiu dialed Yuan Chuling’s cell number and asked in a heavy voice after the call got through, “What happened? How did you get hurt?”</p><p>“Some people came over to make trouble when the fitness center was being renovated, and they were in large numbers. Some of the bastards were very strong; we were unable to beat them,” replied Yuan Chuling bitterly.</p><p>“Where are you now?” Asked Tang Xiu in a deep voice.</p><p>“Shanghai First Public Hospital,” said Yuan Chuling.</p><p>“Tell me your ward number, I’ll coming,” said Tang Xiu.</p><p>Immediately afterward, Tang Xiu walked to the dining room and said in a deep voice, “There’s an urgent matter, so I must go out. You can treat this as your house.”</p><p>Having said that, he ignored their questioning voices. He went straight to the courtyard, started the car, and drove away. After spending half an hour on the road he arrived at Shanghai First Public Hospital. Though it wasn’t his first time there, and he also knew the President of the hospital, he didn’t call anyone. He went straight to the Inpatient Department’s ward on the 6th floor, where Yuan Chuling was being hospitalized.</p><p>At this time there were three sickbeds on the ward, where three youths were lying. Aside from Yuan Chuling, who was half-lying, the other two were wearing oxygen masks.</p><p>“Tell me about the situation in detail.”</p><p>With a grim expression, Tang Xiu’s vision shifted to Yuan Chuling.</p><p>Yuan Chuling’s head was wrapped with a gauze and there were traces of blood seeping out. Traces of bloodstains could also be seen on his face, while his arms were also plastered. He looked really bad and miserable.</p><p>“Eldest Brother, we were really done in this time.” Yuan Chuling said with a bitter expression. “It was because I looked for another construction team for the renovation. Back then I didn’t want to hire them because the other party asked a very outrageous price. As a result, a group of people then came to our door the next day. Not only did they obstruct the workers, they also demanded compensation for emotional damage or something. At the end of the day, the disagreement led to a brawl, and now you see that two of my classmates have been injured, their wounds worse than mine.”</p><p>After taking a deep breath, Tang Xiu asked, “How are their conditions, exactly?”</p><p>“Their lives are not in danger; however, they must rest for a few days due to the condition of their injuries. However, our present trouble is about the campus. If by chance the campus takes disciplinary action to punish us due to skipping classes -- or worse, expel us -- we’ll really be done for,” said Yuan Chuling.</p><p>“You don’t need to worry about your campus. I’ll find someone to help you out with that. Now, tell me about this construction team,” said Tang Xiu.</p><p>“Eldest Brother, I know that your Kung Fu is good, but don’t try looking for them, please,” said Yuan Chuling quickly. “Those who hit us are from the construction team, while the rest were only some local rascals. Two or three of them were really strong, and obviously, they knew Kung Fu.”</p><p>“Cut the crap and just tell me!” Tang Xiu knitted his brows. “You don’t need to care about anything else.”</p><p>Hesitating for a moment, Yuan Chuling then honestly told Tang Xiu what he knew about the other party. Afterward, Tang Xiu stayed in the ward for a while before leaving.</p><p>Flames of anger had been ignited inside him.</p><p>After coming back from the Immortal World, his first friend, and the one he had the best relationship with, was Yuan Chuling. In the beginning, when he was being bullied at the Star City First High School, Yuan Chuling was always the one who came forward to stand up for him. When he was compelled to move classes, Yuan Chuling was also the only one who unhesitatingly stood out and left with him.</p><p>Despite feeling some deep down inside toward the existences of the so-called friends, brothers, and the like... However, for Yuan Chuling, who had pulled him out of the pit of his own heart, he would never sit by and do nothing.</p><p>After leaving the hospital, Tang Xiu then drove his car toward the address Yuan Chuling told him -- New Dream Renova Company.</p><p>The façade of New Dream Renova Company was quite imposing and stylish. There were two beautiful reception ladies dressed in long skirts at the entrance; they bowed, greeting and expressing best wishes toward the few guests who walked inside.</p><p>“Welcome, Sir.”</p><p>Upon seeing Tang Xiu’s arrival, the two women bowed and let out genial smiles.</p><p>However, Tang Xiu’s face remained detached. After entering New Dream Renova Company’s entrance and seeing the luxurious decorations as well as the amicable employees inside, he secretly sneered.</p><p>“Hello, Sir. May I ask if there’s anything I can do for you?” Said the youth politely after he approached.</p><p>“I have a big deal to discuss. I need to talk to your Boss,” said Tang Xiu.</p><p>The young man looked at him and carefully sized him up. He vaguely felt that Tang Xiu looked somewhat familiar, but he couldn’t recall where he had seen him. Immediately nodding, he smilingly said, “If so, please follow me to the VIP room. I’ll immediately notify our manager.”</p><p>Nodding, Tang Xiu then followed the young man to the VIP room. After several minutes of wait, the VIP room’s door was pushed open and a well-dress middle-aged man looked at Tang Xiu with a smile on his face, taking several steps forward and smilingly greeting him, “Hello, Sir. I’m the New Dream Renova Company’s Manager. You can call me Manager Li. May I ask how I should address you, Sir?”</p><p>Tang Xiu waved his hand and replied, “The reason why I waited for you is that the young man’s position who brought me here is not high enough. Hence, I had no choice but to directly contact your company’s owner. I have a big business deal to discuss, one that perhaps your New Dream Renova Company may not necessarily able to carry it out. Therefore, I need to see and have a private discussion with your Boss in person.”</p><p>Manager Li slightly frowned. He then probed, “Sir, this big deal, may I know what is it…”</p><p>“It’s the complete renovation of a luxurious residential area,” said Tang Xiu in a deep voice.</p><p>Manager Li stared blankly. He then asked once again, “This luxurious residential area you are talking about is…”</p><p>“I’ll only talk about it with your Boss,” said Tang Xiu coldly.</p><p>Manager Li fell into silence. Then, he slowly nodded, “Sir, our Boss is currently out. If you must meet him, please wait here. I’ll immediately call him when he’s back.”</p><p>“All right!”</p><p>Tang Xiu fished out a cigarette from his pocket, lit it up, and took a deep puff before he nodded and replied.</p><p>As for Manager Li, he slowly and carefully observed Tang Xiu. Thus, he didn’t miss the cigarette smoked by Tang Xiu, as well as the world-class brand watch worn around his wrist. Although he couldn’t figure out Tang Xiu’s identity, he was certain that Tang Xiu was definitely a rich man for the apparels and world-class brand watch he was wearing; they were things that ordinary people couldn’t possess.</p><p>After making the call, instead of going straight back to the VIP room, Manager Li quickly rushed to the first floor entrance. There, he looked to his plump Boss who just got off from the car. With a smile on his face, he said, “Boss, the client is very young, but he seems to be a rich man. I know that from the watch on his wrist; it should be worth several million yuan.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
