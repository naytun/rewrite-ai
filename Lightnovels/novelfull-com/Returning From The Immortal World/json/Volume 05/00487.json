To implement my idea, I’m afraid that the amount needed will not be enough even if this amount is multiplied by ten. So, how much money the Everlasting Feast Hall can provide?”</p><p>Gu Xiaoxue pondered for a short while and then said, “About 28 billion, that’s all the money I have saved. But, if I draw the funds from the various businesses we have, I should be able to transfer another 10 to 20 billion.”</p><p>Thinking for a while, Tang Xiu then said, “It won’t be necessary. Just transfer 9 billion into my account after you return to Jingmen Island. 10 billion yuan should be more or less enough for the upfront investment. But I’ll find you again later if there’s a need to expand the scale.”</p><p>“You don’t have to wait until I return to Jingmen Island, Grand Master,” said Gu Xiaoxue with a smile. “I can transfer the money to you now.”</p><p>A few minutes later, Gu Xiaoxue took back her mobile phone and smilingly said, “I’ve transferred the money to you, Grand Master. However, the bank manager just called me to say that the money will only arrive in your account within three working days.”</p><p>“We need to buy land in a mountain where the Heaven and Earth Spiritual Qi is relatively rich. Lands in mountainous areas are quite cheap, though developing it will prove rather difficult. However, we can still accomplish it if we pour sufficient funds in it. It’s just that I haven’t decided the specific location yet. Do you have a good place to recommend?”</p><p>“From the looks of your point of view, setting up herb plantations and rearing wild animals will require us to pay close attention to the weather, temperature, topography, water conservancy, and other related conditions. I myself rarely go out, and only have been to a few famous mountains. So there’s no good place I can recommend to you. However, I do have an idea.” Gu Xiaoxue shook her head and said.</p><p>“What’s your idea?” Asked Tang Xiu.</p><p>“I think we had better buy the rights to develop an island rather than purchasing plots of land in the mainland,” said Gu Xiaoxue. “Firstly, we can rent them. While the rent itself is quite cheap, many of these islands are rich in Heaven and Earth Spiritual Qi, thus suitable for growing medicinal herbs and rearing wild animals. Of course, what is most important is the issue with the caregivers. If we do it in the mainland we will need a large number of people to carry out the security work, while on an island would be different altogether. We only need to send a number of experts to be stationed there with the assistance of high-tech surveillance instruments to make the area absolutely safe.”</p><p>“You’re right! I never thought of this before.” Tang Xiu’s eyes lit up. “Jingmen Island is located in the South China Sea. To plant medicinal herbs and rear wild animals in a few chosen islands would be better, I think. So be it! I’ll take the time to go to South China Sea to survey the area. Once I’ve decided the places, I’ll immediately deal with the renting issues, and begin to invest in the development.”</p><p>“Then I’ll prepare a list of security team members ahead of time, Grand Master,” said Gu Xiaoxue with a faint smile. “May I ask you what the appropriate number would be?”</p><p>“Talking about that is too early, though it’s still necessary to prepare in advance.” Tang Xiu shook his head. “Alright then! Pick 50 core members first, but don’t them anything yet. When everything has been arranged properly I’ll personally test them. If they get my approval, they will bring a number of peripheral members to be stationed in the picked island.”</p><p>“Affirmative!” Gu Xiaoxue gently nodded.</p><p>After discussing the proper business, Tang Xiu looked at Gu Xiaoxue’s bright eyes. And suddenly, he didn’t know what to say for a moment. Though he had been in contact with her for a while now, Gu Xiaoxue’s innate cold character made them have a very few common topics besides speaking about proper and serious matters.</p><p>After staying silent for two minutes, Tang Xiu eventually said, “Xiaoxue, if you don’t have anything else to do, go pick something to eat first! Also, please look after Yan’er well after you return to Jingmen Island.”</p><p>“I will,” said Gu Xiaoxue with a nod.</p><p>Tang Xiu suddenly recalled something and quickly said, “Wait, when will you return to Jingmen Island, exactly?”</p><p>“Since I’ve already met you and the Paradise Manor has officially opened, I’m planning to go back to Jingmen Island this afternoon,” answered Gu Xiaoxue.</p><p>“Since you happen to be here, take the children back with you to Jingmen Island while convenient! These children are all orphans. I adopted them and they are now living with me in Bluestar Villa Complex. Remember to settle them with those children who have already come previously. These five kids have learned a bit of Kung Fu, and I’ve also imparted them body tempering techniques. So add some more things to do when you’re training them.”</p><p>“Then I’ll go with you when you return home, Grand Master,” said Gu Xiaoxue with a faint smile. “Afterward, I’ll take them away with me.”</p><p>“All right, then. I’ll call you when I’m about to leave,” said Tang Xiu. “That’s right. There’s someone called Chen Zhizhong in the banquet hall. He’s an in-name disciple of mine. Take the time to go and see him.”</p><p>“I’ll go later, then,” Gu Xiaoxue’s eyes lit up and replied with a nod.</p><p>After she left, Tang Xiu kept the lists and relaxingly nested on the sofa. He didn’t want to bother himself with anything else and just wanted to lie down there cultivating for a while. Despite the star force inside his meridians not needing him to control it, there was something that piqued his interest and suspicion. The circulation speed of the star force had significantly increased, and its absorption of solar power also had increased to a much faster rate.</p><p>Without him expecting it, someone was coming toward him. Tang Xiu took no notice of it, and comfortable half-laid in his spot.</p><p>“Mom, it doesn’t seem so cold here,” a childish voice entered Tang Xiu’s ear.</p><p>It was a woman in her 30s. She had a beautiful face, wearing a shawl and shining earrings and carrying a bag for books. Her name was Gu Hui, and she followed her husband to attend the opening ceremony of Paradise Manor. Half an hour ago, however, her child felt unwell and seemed to have caught a cold. Therefore, she lost her appetite and bid polite excuses to the others and her husband, and then prepared to take her son to the hospital.</p><p>“Dongdong, don’t speak. This uncle is asleep, don’t disturb him.”</p><p>The boy that seemed to be four or five years old shot Tang Xiu a look and silently nodded, yet his little figure moved closer toward Tang Xiu, while his slightly pale face also showed a comfortable expression.</p><p>Finally, Tang Xiu opened his eyes and glanced at the mother and son. His eyes finally landed on the little boy and frowned, since he could sense death qi in him.</p><p>“Little kid, can uncle give you a hug?”</p><p>The boy looked up at his mother.</p><p>“Sir, my son caught a bit of a cold, I’m afraid you will be infected. So…” said Gu Hui quickly.</p><p>Tang Xiu shook his head and smiled. He hugged the small boy. While at that, he used his fingers to feel his pulse, and kept at it for more than 20 seconds. Afterward, Tang Xiu furrowed his brows slightly, as he looked up and asked Gu Hui, “Was there a case of homicide or murder in your family recently?”</p><p>“Murder? There has been no homicide… Huh? Sir, are you…” Gu Hui was confused.</p><p>Raising his hand to interrupt her, Tang Xiu said, “If there was no murder case in your family, that means that someone very close to your son has personally encountered a homicide case. And the time it happened should be no less than two days ago.”</p><p>Gu Hui frowned as she snatched her son and stepped back. There was a vigilant look on her face as she said, “Mister, I don’t get what you mean by that. There has never been a murder case in my family, and the only people close to my son are my husband and I, and we have never encountered a murder case either. So please don’t talk such nonsensical things!”</p><p>After saying that, she was about to leave with her son.</p><p>Tang Xiu squinted his eyes and looked at her back while speaking, “Your son is not suffering from a cold, but because he got exposed to death qi. I don’t think the hospital will be able to cure this condition. Of course, you may question this and leave. But your son is still too young, and his life force will be fully corroded by the death qi in seven days at the most. By that time, he will lose his life.”</p><p>Gu Hui was an atheist. She instantly turned around upon hearing his words and angrily stared at him, saying, “More absurd things. Then don’t blame for calling out people to kick you out.”</p><p>Having said that, she hastily left while hugging the boy.</p><p>Tang Xiu could only shake his head. The cycle of karma, the cause and effect of the Heavenly Dao has a profound and deep influence that will affect the lives of ordinary people. The current himself was also under the influence of the Heavenly Dao at all times. Unless he could break the shackles on his neck and ascend to become an Immortal, only then would he be able to get rid of the interference of the Heavenly Dao.</p><p>One’s wealth, status, and honor are set and preordained by the Heavens!</p><p>Despite him encountering such a thing, nevertheless, if the child’s mother didn’t believe in him, and didn’t allow him to clearly inspect her child and dispel the death qi on the boy willingly, then it would mean that the boy was fated to die a few days later.</p><p>Inside the pagoda-shaped restaurant…</p><p>On the second floor of the banquet hall, hundreds of guests had filled the entire venue. In front of the luxurious tables, the crowd were tasting the gourmet and praising them while sipping Gods Nectar.</p><p>At the innermost placed table, Ouyang Lulu was accompanied by Mayor Wang Tao, Zhang Yueming, Zhang Xinya and a few other guests with prominent status, merrily chatting and laughing while dining.</p><p>At this time, Gu Xiaoxue came. Donning a white dress that fluttered, she was as though a fairy who descended to Earth. Her arrival in the banquet hall attracted the eyes of numerous people as she came to Ouyang Lulu’s side.</p><p>“Sis Xiaoxue, come and sit down with me.”</p><p>Previously, Ouyang Lulu never expected that Gu Xiaoxue would be willing to come and dine here. Hence, a pleasantly surprised look immediately appeared on her face.</p><p>“No, I can’t,” said Gu Xiaoxue as she shook her head. “I only came here to see Martial Uncle, Lulu.”</p><p>After saying that, she asked for an empty glass and then went toward Chen Zhizhong, who was at the same table, and softly said, “Martial Uncle, Xiaoxue didn’t know that you were here, too, so I didn’t come to pay you a visit. I hope you can forgive me. Please, accept this glass of wine as a token of respect from your Martial Niece.”</p><p>Chen Zhizhong got up, but was urged to sit still by Gu Xiaoxue. He then received the glass of wine and smilingly said, “Have you seen Master?”</p><p>“Yes. Grand Master is currently resting. It was him who told me that you were here,” answered Gu Xiaoxue.</p><p>Master?</p><p>Grand Master?</p><p>The other people around the table had strange expressions on their faces as they looked at Chen Zhizhong and Gu Xiaoxue. They didn’t understand what they were talking about. A master to such a prominent figure like Chen Zhizhong, who exactly could this sacred being be?</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
