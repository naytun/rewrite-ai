What puzzled him was that Ouyang Lulu and Zhang Xinya hadn’t left yet. Instead, they nested lasilly on the sofa, crunching snacks, watching idol dramas, chatting and laughing merrily.</p><p>“You girls are lazing about, huh?” Tang Xiu asked in a strange tone.</p><p>Ouyang Lulu jumped up from the sofa and put on the slippers, saying, “We were awfully busy, all right? We’d have just gone shopping earlier if wasn’t for waiting for you, you know.”</p><p>They very busy? Still, they went shopping?</p><p>Tang Xiu didn’t dare butter up. He could only shake his head and smilingly say, “If I remember correctly, Xinya’s concert seems to be tomorrow night, right?”</p><p>Zhang Xinya stood up and smiled. As she picked up her bag and took out a stack of tickets from the inside. She handed it to Tang Xiu and said, “The Genius Mr. Tang, since you don’t want to be a special guest at my concert, would you give me face and attend it as an ordinary audience? Anyways, here are some tickets for the concert; you can give it to your classmates and friends. I invite you to come and support us.”</p><p>After hesitating for a short while, Tang Xiu took the concert tickets and smilingly said, “Since the big star herself says so, it would be impolite to not go. All right, I’ll be there at the appointed time.”</p><p>“To have the honorable Mr. Genius Tang come watch me, I’m sure the concert will be very successful,” said Zhang Xinya smilingly.</p><p>“Can you stop joking?” Tang Xiu laughed. “What’s this Mr. Genius Tang? I’m not related with Tang Bohu at all, you know.”</p><p>“Hehehe…” Zhang Xinya used her hand to cover her giggles.</p><p>Ring, ring, ring…</p><p>The mobile phone’s melodious ringtone rang.</p><p>Tang Xiu took out his mobile phone and looked at the caller’s number. To his surprise, it was an unfamiliar number, seemingly from the Beijing area. His brows immediately raised, as he pressed the answer button and said, “Tang Xiu speaking, may I know who am I speaking with?”</p><p>“Boss, it’s me, Li Xiaojie.”</p><p>A man’s voice came out from the mobile phone.</p><p>After slightly racking his memory, only then did Tang Xiu recall who Li Xiaojie was. He was a talent trained by the Tang Family, and once helped him to deal with the Yao Family in Guangyang.</p><p>“Is there something you need?”</p><p>“Boss, the family has arranged for me to take charge of some intelligence work and I just got transferred to Beijing. Anyhow, I just received a intelligence report that some terrorists are going to create an incident in Shanghai tomorrow!” Said Li Xiaojie.</p><p>“You say that terrorists will create an incident here... but why are you calling me?” Asked Tang Xiu with a frown.</p><p>“According to the intelligence report, these terrorists’ attack should start in the concert of that big star, Zhang Xinya. You are in Shanghai now, and I’m afraid you will go to Zhang Xinya’s concert. As of now, the government agencies have already taken charge of the security issues over there. Still, I think I need to tell you this as to prevent any accidents.”</p><p>With a slightly changed complexion, Tang Xiu asked in a deep voice, “These terrorists, who are they?”</p><p>“They should be some domestic activists and extremists,” said Li Xiaojie. “We found them in our country after some investigation. They have an extremely radical ideology and detest the way of our society, as well as have formed an underground small organization. That very same organization was also responsible for several incidents that threatened the public and endangered social stability back then. However, the Ministry of State Security was always able to avert the crisis every time. These people are very cunning and crafty, and despite most of them having been arrested by the state, a fraction of the organization is still free.”</p><p>Like always, all kinds of birds can be found when the woods are big enough.</p><p>The actual truth of this statement was perfectly clear to Tang Xiu. Therefore, people with extremely radical ideas and ideologies, and people who rebelled against society always existed. Only, this group was small in number -- the reason why the state had the intention to contain any news about them and why many people outside the inner circles were oblivious to their existence.</p><p>However, as a friend of Zhang Xinya, he could never allow those radical extremists to make trouble at her concert.</p><p>After pondering for a while, Tang Xiu then said, “Who’s in charge of the operation from the government agencies?”</p><p>“The Sixth Deputy Minister from the Ministry of State Security, Liu Changxi,” said Li Xiaojie. “He took his people and left for Shanghai last night and joined the other bunch from State Security there. He also collaborated with the police force to ensure the public safety and the security issues for Zhang Xinya’s concert tomorrow morning.”</p><p>“Give me Liu Changxi’s contact number,” said Tang Xiu.</p><p>“Boss, are you…” Li Xiaojie was surprised.</p><p>“Zhang Xinya is a friend of mine, so I can’t allow any accidents to happen in her concert,” said Tang Xiu. “Anyways, thanks a lot for forwarding this news to me. I’ll treat you later when I’m back to Beijing in November.”</p><p>“This is what I’m supposed to do, Boss!” Li Xiaojie’s tone was flattering.</p><p>“Alright then!” Tang Xiu smilingly said, “But don’t forget to get me his contact number!”</p><p>After saying that, Tang Xiu ended the call with a cloudy expression.</p><p>At the side, as Zhang Xinya saw Tang Xiu fall into deep thought, she asked, “Who called you, Tang Xiu? I heard he saying that an accident is going to happen at my concert tomorrow night? What exactly is going on?”</p><p>“The man who just called me is a member of some government agency,” said Tang Xiu in a heavy voice. “He told me that there will be a number of radical extremists in your concert tomorrow evening. If they were to resort to extreme methods, I’m afraid that bloody and tragic incidents would happen. As of now, the leader from the Ministry of State Security has come to Shanghai, and if my guess is correct, someone will contact you later today.”</p><p>“Radical extremists? Who are they, exactly?” Asked Zhang Xinya, confused.</p><p>“You know that all kind of birds exist if the forest is big enough. China has a population of more than 1 billion people, so it’s a given that some will have extreme ideologies and detest the way of society. These people have also formed a secret small organization, and they were responsible for some bloody incidents in the past that threatened the social stability. And this time, their target is your concert in Shanghai. Once they are successful, at that time, the impact and collateral damage will be enormous.”</p><p>Zhang Xinya’s facial expression turned somewhat pale. She simply didn’t dare imagine it. If such incident happened just like Tang Xiu said, it would cause enormous damage and severely harm her fans, leading to a tremendous bad impact to her fame and reputation as well.</p><p>While looking at Tang Xiu, who looked solemn, Zhang Xinya hurriedly pulled his arm and nervously said, “Tang Xiu, what should I do? Cancel the concert?”</p><p>“Cancelling the concert will prove to be very troublesome, I’m afraid,” Tang Xiu shook his head. “As far as I know, the tickets for your concert are almost all sold out, right? Your fans will surely be furious once it got canceled, and that will bring you a tremendous negative influence. Furthermore, I’m sure your business partners won’t agree either. Of course, the most important thing is, some top brasses from the state are hoping that they can apprehend and clean up the extremists while you are carrying out your concert.”</p><p>Zhang Xinya gaped. She didn’t know how to respond for a while, yet her eyes gave out a pleading look for help as she gazed at Tang Xiu.</p><p>“The leader in charge of this operation from the state is a man called Liu Changxi. I’ll give him a call now to discuss the issue of cooperation. If there really are radical extremists doing terrorist activities at your concert, at that time, the very first thing that shall be done is to capture them immediately, hence stopping their villainous acts.\"</p><p>Zhang Xinya hastily nodded, eyes full of gratitude.</p><p>Immediately after, Tang Xiu dialed the phone number sent by Li Xiaojie, as a deep and heavy voice was heard ten seconds afterward, “Li Changxi here, who am I speaking with?</p><p>“Hello, Secretary Liu. I’m Tang Xiu,” said Tang Xiu.</p><p>“Tang Xiu? Who is Tang Xiu?” Liu Changxi’s tone was very cold.</p><p>“My grandfather is Tang Guosheng, and Tang Yunpeng is my uncle,” said Tang Xiu.</p><p>There was no reply from the other side for ten seconds. Then, the man said in a softer tone, “I heard about you, Tang Xiu. You are that missing grandson of the Tang Family. By the way, is Elder Tang in good health? And about you looking for me…”</p><p>“Mr. Liu, grandfather is in good health. I’m calling you because I got some news that some people will come to exert their terrorist activities at Zhang Xinya’s concert in Shanghai tomorrow evening. Furthermore, I also learned news that you are the person in charge of this security issue. Can we talk in person?”</p><p>After hesitating for a while, Liu Changxi said, “First of all, I need to ask you something, Tang Xiu. The safety issue of Zhang Xinya’s concert is the responsibility of the people from our Ministry of State Security as well as the police force. Why are you paying attention to this matter?”</p><p>“Zhang Xinya is a friend of mine, and I’m also in Shanghai now,” said Tang Xiu seriously. “If anything, I also have some ability.”</p><p>“I’m at Shangri-La Hotel, Room #808. Do take note that you must be vigilant when you come; we just found a small fish staying in the room #8066,” said Liu Changxi.</p><p>“All right!”</p><p>Tang Xiu replied shortly. Just as he was about to hang up, he suddenly thought of something and spoke again, “Mr. Secretary Liu, I wonder. Why is it that you can confirm my identity even though it’s my first time calling you? You even told me about this small fish?”</p><p>“There was someone from the Ministry who called and gave us your number half a minute ago,” answered Liu Changxi.</p><p>“I see,” replied Tang Xiu, shocked.</p><p>After ending the call, Tang Xiu looked at Zhang Xinya and said, “What are you going to do?”</p><p>“I’ll stay here with you,” answered Zhang Xinya.</p><p>Tang Xiu nodded, “Anyways, Lulu, if you have nothing else to do, stay here to accompany Xinya. I’m going to see the man in charge for this operation first, and assign a group of experts from Jingmen Island to come here while convenient. They will be in charge of the security and safety issues at the concert when the time comes.”</p><p>“Thank you,” said Zhang Xinya with a grateful look.</p><p>“Haven’t you heard what I just said?” Tang Xiu waved his hand. “We are friends, let’s dispense the formalities. Besides, I don’t want to see criminals threatening the public security to continue to harm people.”</p><p>“Hey, how about I send some of my people too?” Said Ouyang Lulu.</p><p>“No need. I will assign some of my own people to come here.” Tang Xiu waved his hand. “By that time, some people will secretly protect Xinya. Even if someone were to slip through the security, it will be impossible for them to harm Xinya.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
