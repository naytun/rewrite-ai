With them walking shoulder-to-shoulder on the road inside the campus, the eyes of numerous people were naturally attracted to them.</p><p>Nevertheless, they had long been accustomed to being the focus of attention and promptly ignored them.</p><p>“Anyway, why did Li Xinjie and the others leave in a hurry, Wanying?” In the tree-lined road, Tang Xiu proceeded forward as he asked curiously.</p><p>“They probably have something urgent to do!” Mu Wanying replied with a faint smile.</p><p>There was a note of evasion in her reply.</p><p>Possessing both good looks and brains, she knew perfectly well about the disposition of her dorm sisters, how could she not be aware of their intention? They were hoping that she could build up a relationship with Tang Xiu? Hence, they excused themselves and took their leave due to some matters, hoping that she would get along with Tang Xiu.</p><p>Alas!</p><p>Regardless, Mu Wanying secretly sighed. She had already exposed what she felt inside last night. It was indeed blanketed tactfully, yet Tng Xiu’s attitude made her very helpless. She had never expected that a male student who was two years younger than herself would reject her.</p><p>Ring, ring, ring…</p><p>A mobile phone’s ringtone sounded.</p><p>Tang Xiu took his cell phone out and looked at the number on the screen. After connecting the call, he said with a smile, “Kang Xia, something happened for you to call me at this time?”</p><p>“Boss, our Magnificent Tang Corporation has encountered some trouble.” From the phone, Kang Xia’s answer was ice cold.</p><p>“What trouble?” Tang Xiu frowned.</p><p>“Our Magnificent Tang Corp’s business has been extremely good ever since listing our three products. Nevertheless, due to us employing a business policy of producing and marketing these products by ourselves with no business agents in the middle, half a month ago, many commercial giants from various countries engaging in the liquor business, cosmetics, and healthcare products have sent hundreds of their representative companies to our Magnificent Tang Corp, wanting to secure a cooperation with us.”</p><p>“You already talked to me about this issue. My answer was very simple, that our products won’t be marketed out of the country for the time being. Then, what exactly is the matter?” Said Tang Xiu.</p><p>“I rejected their offer completely as per your instructions, Boss,” said Kang Xia with a forced smile. “Yet, relying on their wealth and strength, a dozen forces carried out large-scale attacks on some raw materials needed by our Magnificent Tang Corp’s products. Just last night, some people secretly contacted several top executives of our company and offered a stellar amount of money in the hopes that they could get the formula for the Gods Nectar, Skin Care Lotion, and Scar Removal Cream to be sold to them. Fortunately, your show of strength in the company’s celebration banquet in Star City a few days ago has made them aware of your strength, and they even obtained a lot of rewards there. Hence, they promptly reported it to me about this.”</p><p>A cold light burst inside Tang Xiu’s eyes.</p><p>The formula?!! That was the core secret of the three products of the Magnificent Tang Corp. Once the formulas were exposed, others would be able to imitate it on a large scale, thus greatly impacting his company’s business.</p><p>Cutting off one’s source of financial resources was akin to killing his own parents!</p><p>Despite Tang Xiu himself regarding money as a very light issue, yet seeing now as how others were threatening him and wanting to cut off his financial source, it was something he could never accept.</p><p>“Kang Xia, I’ll assign a group of experts to Star City again under you. Don’t act rashly at first. Just protect our core secrets and our company’s top executives. I will have a holiday two days later. I’ll solve those people by that time.”</p><p>“Boss, why don’t we solve these hidden problems in advance?” Asked Kang Xia.</p><p>“Are you sure? You have the confidence?” Asked Tang Xiu back.</p><p>“Confidence?” Kang Xia forced a smile. “The background of those parties are very strong. There are two forces that can be said as very terrifying. Let alone the present strength of our Magnificent Tang Corp, even if our strength is a hundred times stronger than now, I’m afraid…”</p><p>“Which forces, exactly?” Asked Tang Xiu, frowning.</p><p>“It’s the Cubo Clan, an Italian mafia syndicate, and the Brauns Group from the United States,” said Kang Xia.</p><p>Tang Xiu memorized these two names and said, “Got it. All you gotta do now is protect the core secrets and top executives of our company before I get back. As for the raw materials, buy as many of them as you can, and keep quiet if you can’t. At the worst, just send the factory workers home temporarily.”</p><p>“Roger that!” Replied Kang Xia.</p><p>Tang Xiu ended the call. As he saw the curious look in Mu Wanying’s eyes, he said in a subtle manner, “Something happened in my company in Star City.”</p><p>Mu Wanying nodded and asked, “Is there anything I can do to help?”</p><p>“No need,” Tang Xiu shook his head. “I can solve it myself.”</p><p>“I know you’re very powerful, but one’s individual ability is limited, after all. If there’s a need of it, please speak to me freely. Though I myself am not the one with the ability, yet I’m the one in the family my Grandpa dotes on the most,” said Mu Wanying.</p><p>“Wanying, we’ve been getting along well, but I don’t know much about the situation in your family. Are you by any chance from Beijing?” Tang Xiu’s complexion suddenly changed a bit, as he looked at her and asked out of curiosity.</p><p>“Ehh, you know nothing about my family, I suppose? Seems like I cannot arouse your curiosity, hmm?” Mu Wanying looked at Tang Xiu with a strange expression.</p><p>“No, it’s not like that.” Tang Xiu shook his head as he smilingly replied. “We’re friends. But it doesn’t mean that I need to know your family’s background or something like that. You see, now that the topic came to this point, I wouldn’t have had the idea to ask you!”</p><p>“I’m from Beijing’s House of Mu.” A hint of smile outlined on the corner of Mu Wanying’s mouth. “And my Grandpa is Mu Chengfeng.”</p><p>It’s him?</p><p>Tang Xiu was startled inside, and a surprised look appeared in his eyes. Though the Mu Family from Beijing was slightly inferior to the Tang Family, they were definitely a powerful family. The Mu’s Family Head, Mu Chengfeng, was an illustrious senior official in the country in the past, and one of those who stood at the apex in the country.</p><p>“Never thought you would be a lady from a great house.” Surprise only stayed for a second on Tang Xiu’s face, as it was then replaced by a light smile afterward.</p><p>While holding her smile, Mu Wanying said, “If anything, I was very young when I met Tang Ying back then. I didn’t know what background or anything a house could have. But after I grew up, casting aside our family’s background, we then became bosom friends and talked about anything. Otherwise, with the pride carved in Tang Ying’s bone, how could I have become a her sister, to begin with?”</p><p>“It’s not the person’s fault to act snobbish, but the common customs that influence them,” said Tang Xiu.</p><p>“True that, I agree!” Mu Wanying’s eyes lit up; Tang Xiu spoke what she had in mind.</p><p>Quickly, the duo parted ways at an intersection. Mu Wanying had to return to the dormitory, while Tang Xiu headed straight to the classroom building. There was only one class this morning, and despite him already have studied and grasped the content for the course independently, it was still necessary to attend class.</p><p>The credit system made him not dare to skip any more classes.</p><p>His classmates had already arrived inside the classroom. Seeing Tang Xiu’s arrival, the originally lively classroom turned devoid of any sounds in just a few seconds. Many people took out their cell phones and looked at something in it before they set their eyes on Tang Xiu. There were various complex expressions on their faces.</p><p>“Holy cow, Tang Eldest Bro’s face seems to have bathed in a spring breeze. Was it because you just had good things coming to you? Hehehe… Today, the most famous person on our campus is definitely Eldest Bro Tang. However, the one that people are most hostile toward, too, is definitely no one but you, Tang Eldest Bro! Anyways, did someone throw eggs and bricks at you when you got here?” Yue Kai flung his long hair in front of his forehead and smilingly inquired.</p><p>“Big Bro Tang is so clean and spotless, how could he have those rotten eggs and muddy footprints on him? Besides, they are just jealous. They just say grapes are sour because they can’t eat them. Anyhow, Tang Big Bro, this Old Hu will say here and now. Whoever dares to make life difficult for you, that’s equal to making life difficult for me, Hu Qingsong!”</p><p>“Yea, count me in!” Xue Chao also shouted.</p><p>Tang Xiu was at a loss whether he had to cry or laugh upon seeing the trio, and asked, “What the hell are you talking about, guys? Who is the most famous? And what is this about me becoming the target of everyone’s hostility? I didn’t even brought my car today; keeping low profile as always. How could I offend people anywhere?”</p><p>Hu Qingsong raised the gadget in his hand and loudly said, “Don’t tell me you know nothing about it, Big Bro Tang? There was a rumpus on the campus forum, saying that you and Mu Wanying came together this morning. Even fools are able to guess that you’ve been together last night. Do you think no one knows what happens when a man and woman get together, huh? Anyways, the photos of you and the great belle Mu coming together from outside the campus have already been uploaded into the campus forum. I myself just had a look at them, and there are at least a hundred posts, all of which are news about you. You see, the number of clicks and comments are simply hiking up to the top!”</p><p>Tang Xiu rolled his eyes, as he took out his mobile phone to open the campus forum. What made him dumbfounded was that he got rained down by streams of curses within such a short time. Many male students were looking for him, asking him to a duel and saying that they wanted to snatch Mu Wanying back from him.</p><p>It’s only a bunch of trashes that have nothing to do with their free time.</p><p>Shaking his head, Tang Xiu grumbled inwardly, before he said out loud, “Fellow students, these are fabricated lies! Please don’t believe them! My relationship with Mu Wanying is pure and chaste. We’re nothing but a Senior Sister and a Junior Brother in the campus, nothing else at all. We came here together because she stayed at my house last night.”</p><p>“Oh, oh…”</p><p>Immediately, apart from Yue Kai and Zhao Liang who visited Tang Xiu’s villa last night, the rest clamored with odd expressions. One of the classmates with long mustachios shouted, “Awesome! You’re really awesome, Big Bro Tang! How long has it been since we started our term? Yet you have unexpectedly brought the Great Belle Mu to your place already?!! O’ Saint of Love, O’ God of Amour, please show us your grace and kindness to teach us, these singles, these damned bachelors, to get out of that fucking list!”</p><p>Tang Xiu turned around and snappily said, “What drivel is this? What do you mean with this Saint of Love and God of Amour? We are all classmates. Once a fellow student, we’re close relatives for three lifetimes. The males will become good buddies, while the females will be good sisters. Anyhow, I’ll treat you all in the campus’s snack street at noon, and Yue Kai will pay the bills. Later on, everyone must act charitably, to wash away the injustice on my behalf!”</p><p>“Huh?” Yue Kai angrily called out. “YOU INVITED THEM! BUT WHY DO I HAVE TO PAY FOR IT? HOW CAN I AFFORD PAYING FOR ALL THESE PEOPLE?”</p><p>“Be at ease, I’ll take you to someplace some other day,” said Tang Xiu with a chuckle.</p><p>“Aargh! My pocket money will be cleaned out!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
