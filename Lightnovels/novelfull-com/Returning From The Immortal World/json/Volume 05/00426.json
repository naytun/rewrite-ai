On the pool table beside them were a red wine and ashtrays, while two young girls wearing bikinis stood at the side, ready to pour tea and wine at any time.</p><p>“Brothers, how is our Blue City’s hot spring? Does it feel good?” Long Zhenglin touched his big bald head while his other hand clamped a cigar, as he smilingly said while smoking.</p><p>“Yup, this is great!” Huang Xiu grinned and said, “Pity the Boss of this place is unable to adapt to the circumstances, though. He’s kind of insensible and doesn’t allow hot chicks to hook up with us within this outdoor hot spring.”</p><p>“Second Young Master Huang, can’t you live without women?” Fei Shan smirked and said, “If you wanna play with hot chicks you gotta go to another place.”</p><p>Huang Xu chuckled, “No argument here! Anyhow, forget it. Let’s not speak about chicks. Zhenglin, you invited us this time, it wasn’t just to have us bath in the hot spring, was it? Do you want us to help advertise your company in Blue City?”</p><p>“Only my parents and Brother Huang know who I am.” Long Zhenglin gave a thumbs up and praised, “Anyhow, you all know my Long Family has a quite amazing talent -- my brother. So I don’t need to worry about having to manage the family’s business. Hence, I ran to Blue City to rely on myself. And since the three of you are the Blue City’s local snakes, I wouldn’t have been able to pull it off without your help.”</p><p>“Well, count yourself smart, buddy.” Huang Xu smiled and said, “You can rest your worries. We’ll help you pull in some businesses after we go back. Anyways, is your big brother busy at work recently? I haven’t seen his shadow for a long time.”</p><p>“What else?” Long Zhenglin said with a smile, “We got quite a big business deal some time ago, so he has been busy working on it abroad! I went back home once or twice recently, and I haven’t seen him either.”</p><p>“Your Long Family has expanded overseas?” Huang Xu was surprised.</p><p>“That’s my brother’s work. I got nothing to do with it.” Long Zhenglin smiled and said, “As for me, I kinda miss my days fooling around with Eldest Brother Tang. It was great.”</p><p>“Ah, right. Where’s Tang Xiu now?” Fei Shan curiously said, “Why didn’t you call him out today?”</p><p>“Huh? How would he have free time? He gotta study as well as manage his business, so he should be in Shanghai now! Anyhow, I’m thinking of making a trip to Shanghai to him in a few days!”</p><p>“Zhenglin, you gotta remember to call me when you go, buddy!” Huang Xu quickly said, “I kind of miss the wine his company produces. It’s so damn unfortunate, I only got two bottles until now. That was also because I sent people to wait in line for days and nights in front of Blue City’s exclusive store. It was kinda hard to line up to buy it.”</p><p>“Yea, true that! I only got two bottles too.” Fei Shan sighed, “Since we’re acquaintances with Tang Xiu, we should be able to get through the back door and get tons of Gods Nectar!”</p><p>“Gods Nectar?”</p><p>One of the other young men, who hadn’t yet talked, had his expression suddenly changed, asking, “Are you talking about the Magnificent Tang Group who produces the Gods Nectar?”</p><p>“You seem to be a wine lover as well, Young Master Chen!” Huang Xu said with a smile, “Yup, Gods Nectar is indeed produced by the Magnificent Tang Corp, but unfortunately, the number produced is way too low.”</p><p>The young man narrowed his eyes and asked, “That Tang Xiu you were talking about, does he work at Magnificent Tang Corp, or does he know someone from that company’s top executives?”</p><p>Huang Xu, Fei Shan, and Long Zhenglin exchanged looks, as the trio then suddenly grinned and laughed.</p><p>With a proud expression, Long Zhenglin said with a smile, “Young Master Chen, Eldest Brother Tang is none other than the Magnificent Tang Corp’s Big Boss. Otherwise, why do you think he could make this Long Zhenglin recognize him as the Eldest Brother?”</p><p>“The Magnificent Tang Corp’s Big Boss is Tang Xiu? If anything, I had once sent some people to investigate the owner of that company, but with no results. Someone seem to be intentionally concealing his identity.” The young man was startled and said, “To think that the three of you would actually know him, this is kinda unexpected. Well, you gotta introduce me to him when you got the time.”</p><p>“No prob.” Long Zhenglin grinned and said, “I’ll introduce you to him when I go to Shanghai.”</p><p>“Great!” The young man said.</p><p>Suddenly, his cell phone on the poolside table vibrated. After putting the cigar on the ashtray, he took the phone and looked at the caller's number. After connecting it, he asked, \"What’s up?\"</p><p>“Chief Chen, Second Young Master has just got beaten at the Long’s Dining Hall’s entrance.”</p><p>“What? How did it happen?” Chen Sirui frowned and asked in a deep voice.</p><p>“Second Young Master was pursuing a girl from Magnificent Tang Corp named Andy. He proposed her tonight at the Long’s Dining Hall’s entrance. But the result was that Andy refused and ignored him and proposed another man, instead. After some argument, that Andy beat Second Young Master. Anyways, I only heard about it and didn’t witness it myself. So I’m not too clear about the situation, either.” The opposite party’s voice was transmitted from the phone.</p><p>“I see.” Chen Sirui shook his head and said with a forced smile.</p><p>After hanging up, he dialed another cell number and then spoke, “A’ Jian, go to Long’s Dining Hall. Si’en was just beaten there. Investigate this matter clearly first, how it happened and who was the person who provoked him, and then help him vent his anger.”</p><p>“Affirmative!” A middle-aged man’s voice came out of the phone.</p><p>Upon hearing Chen Sirui’s words, the trio wore curious looks on their faces. Long Zhenglin was even more curious, as he asked, “What happened, Young Master Chen?”</p><p>“It was my brother. He got beaten at Long’s Dining Hall.” Chen Sirui forced a smile and said, “I don’t know about the details, though.”</p><p>“That younger brother of yours is not bad, but he’s kinda old-school, and always do unnecessary things to solve everything.” Long Zhenlin grinned, “I remember a few years ago when he got that yacht after fighting over it with someone else. He compelled that fella into a miserable state, yet he didn’t want to let him go. I heard that that fellow was finally unable to hold any longer and left Blue City?”</p><p>“That’s the flaw in his character, but also his strong point as well.” Chen Sirui sneered, “Almost all of our businesses in Star City have been handed over to him at present, and he also has done a good job at that too. However, I heard that, recently, he has bewitched and obsessed with a girl, an employee of the Magnificent Tang Corp. To be honest, his character is too gentle if you ask me. Had it been me, if you can’t use soft means to get something, just take it by force.”</p><p>“You said there’s still a girl in the world who dares to reject your younger brother?” Long Zhenglin showed the white of his eyes and said, “It’s quite strange, though. The girl couldn’t be Kang Xia, right? She’s Eldest Brother Tang’s favorite girl, and I’m sure he’ll definitely throw his fury toward whoever dares to make a move on her.”</p><p>“It’s not Kang Xia.” Chen Sirui shook his head and said, “Her name is Andy.”</p><p>\"Andy?\"</p><p>Huang Xu and Fei Shan vaguely felt that the name was familiar, though they couldn’t remember where they heard it. Nevertheless, they no longer cared about the matter and continued joking and laughed.</p><p>At Long’s Dining Hall.</p><p>Sitting inside the private box with a bluish and swollen face, Chen Si’en had fury all over his face as he smashed everything on the coffee table, while the Long’s Dining Hall’s General Manager, Zhang Tianfu, could only force out a bitter smile.</p><p>Ring, ring, ring…</p><p>Looking annoyed, Chen Si’en took the mobile phone and saw that the number was familiar. His brows immediately furrowed. After connecting the call, he asked, “Ah Jian, What’s up?”</p><p>“Chief Chen told me to bring a few men to Long’s Dining Hall, where are you Second Young Master?”</p><p>Chen Si’en’s stared blankly for a moment, as his expression then changed a few times, before replying in a heavy voice, “I’m in the Long’s Dining Hall, just come to the private box #0602.”</p><p>“Understood!”</p><p>The call ended.</p><p>Raising his head to Zhang Tianfu, Chen Si’en then said in a heavy voice, “I told you not to be a busybody and meddle in tonight’s business. Regardless of what happens, I’ll take the responsibility.”</p><p>Zhang Tianfu forced out a smile and said, “Young Master Chen, your family also has shares in the Long’s Dining Hall. We’ll be greatly affected if you were to create too big a matter.”</p><p>“I told you that no matter how big the trouble I will take responsibility, didn’t I?” Chen Si’en scornfully said.</p><p>After staying in silence for a while, Zhang Tianfu then slowly nodded and said, “Very well, then I’ll go back to rest since I’m not feeling well tonight.”</p><p>“Just go!” Chen Si’en gloomily said.</p><p>Long’s Dining Hall, Jadewater Hall.</p><p>A party hall that was sufficient to accommodate hundreds of people was now filled with festivity. Rows of long tables were filled with various dishes and drinks. There was also a red carpet at the end of a half a meter platform, along with a microphone and a big sound system at both ends of the platform.</p><p>Inside the Jadewater Hall, dozens of senior executives of the Magnificent Tang Corp were merrily chatting and smiling. Most of the topics revolved around their mysterious Boss.</p><p>“Chief Wei, you’re the most senior among the executives in the Magnificent Tang Corp. You should have seen our Big Boss, right? Can you tell us about him?” A middle-aged man smiled while holding a cup of red wine.</p><p>His question made the other four or five executives turn and look at Wei Zhongfeng.</p><p>“Well, since the Boss said he would come tonight, then he’ll surely come, that’s for sure.” Wei Zhongfeng chuckled and said, “You can’t wait to see Boss and get to know him, do you? Hmm, it’s 6:52 PM now. There’s eight minutes left to 7 PM. I believe Boss will surely come by seven.”</p><p>The middle-aged man smiled and said, “We know that we’ll meet Boss tonight, Chief Wei. But what we want to know is about his character, since we know nothing him! Just tell us a bit first, please, so we can prepare ourselves.”</p><p>“Well, our Boss is easy going, amiable and quite astute and smart.” Wei Zhongfeng said with a smile.</p><p>“All right!” They replied and nodded.</p><p>A few minutes later, as everyone was merrily chatting, Kang Xia and Andy came inside through the Jadewater Hall’s side entrance. As Andy walked down the platform, Kang Xia directly went to the innermost platform, took the microphone and said, “Everyone, may I have your attention, please. It’s two minutes to 7 PM. Since our Boss doesn’t like to waste time, he’ll be out right now. As of now, I’m asking everyone to give your best to applaud and welcome our Magnificent Tang Corp’s Big Boss… Tang… Xiu!”</p><p>Clap, clap, clap…</p><p>Just right as Kang Xia’s voice fell, continuous applause immediately followed.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
