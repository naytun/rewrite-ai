Like before, the situation in front of Jingmen Island’s Everlasting Feast Hall was still lively. However, some large local forces as well as big families residing in Jingmen Island had also learned of what was happening there through various channels.</p><p>“What’s happening here?\"</p><p>With two subordinates, Tang Dong came to the front of the Everlasting Feast Hall’s main building. He suddenly furrowed his brows, looking scared. Behind him, his two men looked at the hundreds of core members of the Everlasting Feast Hall as if they were facing formidable enemies.</p><p>“Boss, could this be one of Gao Yanfeng’s schemes?” A big man whispered.</p><p>“I don’t think so.” Tang Dong shook his head and said, “I know some of them. They are the Everlasting Feast Hall’s people. Even if Gao Yanfeng wants to make things difficult for us, it’s impossible for him to do that in the Everlasting Feast Hall. Hence, such a thing like the Feast at Hong Gate won’t happen tonight, but investigating should not be a problem.”</p><p>Immediately, Tang Dong bypassed them and quickly entered the building toward the box reserved by the other party. He didn’t notice Gu Xiaoxue and Ouyang Lulu, who were standing in the diagonally opposite corner. However, Ouyang Lulu actually saw him and looked a bit surprised.</p><p>“Xiaoxue, I think I just saw Tang Xiu’s uncle.”</p><p>“Grand Master’s uncle? Who was it?”</p><p>“He’s Tang Dong from our Jingmen Island!” Ouyang Lulu whispered, “We met him at the Tang Family’s residence in Beijing when Tang Xiu had an accident previously.”</p><p>Gu Xiaoxue suddenly realized. She frowned and thought for a moment, and then said, “As I recall, he’s also a member of the Tangs, and also the owner of the Seaside Strait Manor. I forgot about this since I was taking care of other things before. It seems like the Everlasting Feast Hall ought to be closer to the Seaside Strait Manor in the future.”</p><p>“You’re way too biased, Sister Xue.” Ouyang Lulu rolled her eyes and said, “The both of us have a very close relationship, and I’m very close with Tang Xiu as well. But why do you want to get closer to the Seaside Strait Manor and don’t want to be closer to my Ouyang Family? You know my Grandpa has always wanted to see your Master before, yet you always refused.”</p><p>“You don’t understand!” Gu Xiaoxue said.</p><p>“What I don’t understand?” Ouyang Lulu snorted, “I really don’t get it. Why you address Tang Xiu as Grand Master? Looking at his age, he’s far from one...”</p><p>“Lulu, will you please shut up?!” Gu Xiaoxue’s complexion darkened and chided, “If you speak any nonsensical things again, see if I don’t break all relations with you.”</p><p>“You don’t want me to say. Okay, I’m not saying anything.” Ouyang Lulu resentfully turned her head, yet she cursed inwardly.</p><p>Inside the main building.</p><p>In a private room, just as Tang Dong stepped inside, two middle-aged men were already waiting there. One of them was a fat man with a shaved head, wearing a jade pendant around his neck, and also wearing six or seven gold rings on his fingers. The other one was a slightly thin middle-aged man, wearing glasses and looking refined. However, his triangular eyes looked cold and grim.</p><p>“Oh, I thought the respected owner of the Seaside Strait Manor—Master Tang wouldn’t dare to come tonight!” The thin middle-aged man—Gao Yanfeng sarcastically said with a smirk.</p><p>Coldly snorting in response, Tang Dong then went to the opposite side of the round table and took a seat. He then said indifferently, “Gao Yanfeng, let alone in Jingmen Island, even in the entire China, there’s no place this Tang Dong does not dare to go. Ask yourself, aren’t you the one who is always a coward? How come you’re acting so insolent now? Don’t tell me you have someone to support you?”</p><p>“Tang Dong, who are you calling a coward?” Gao Yanfeng got up abruptly and bellowed angrily, “You shouldn’t forget that it’s your Seaside Strait Manor who has a problem and needs to ask something from me; not the other way around. Anger me and you will find yourself having your navigation line to Evil Dragon Sea Area directly cut off.”</p><p>“Why don’t you try it if you really got the ability?” Tang Dong shouted back coldly.</p><p>Sitting between the two, the fat middle-aged man slammed the table with his shining fingers, shouting, “Didn’t you say you wanted to solve the problem? Why are you still quarreling? You two wanted me to become the middleman this time, and I’ll do as requested. But if you continue acting like this, I’m out.”</p><p>Gao Yanfeng stared at Tang Dong. He then relaxed and lit a cigarette.</p><p>Tang Dong’s brows furrowed slightly and went silent.</p><p>The fat middle-aged man was surnamed Ji, Ji Xiaolong. People called him Fatty Ji, and he could be said to be a character with quite the influence in Jingmen Island. His force was by no means inferior compared to Gao Yanfeng’s Wine Garden and Tang Dong’s Seaside Strait Manor. Hence, all the forces in Jingmen Island would also give him some face.</p><p>Fatty Ji lit a cigarette and watched the two silent men. Afterward, he grinned and nodded in satisfaction, “Tang Dong, this time I’m just a middleman. I invited the two of you here in the hopes that you can come to an agreement. Afterward, your Seaside Strait Manor’s fleet can finally hurry for the Evil Dragon Sea Area.”</p><p>“I want to hear what Boss Gao wants to say first.” Tang Dong said in a deep voice.</p><p>“That’s easy. The island I bought is just on the side of Evil Dragon Sea Area’s navigation line.” Gao Yanfeng sneered, “If you want to pass by my island, you’ll have to give us some profits. Else, you can open another route and pass from there.”</p><p>“You want to profit from my Seaside Strait Manor?” Tang Dong scornfully replied, “I’m afraid you’ll have to pay your life for that.”</p><p>“Tang Dong, you want to scare me with your trivial Seaside Strait Manor?” Gao Yanfeng mocked and said, “My Wine Garden is on par with your Seaside Strait Manor. If you really want to lose all decorum with me, then I’ll accompany you just fine. Besides, doesn’t your Tang Family is in quite a difficult time? I know you’re a member of Beijing’s Tang Family, but your Tang Family has lost quite a lot in Guangyang. Your family may have scared me before, but since I know you have the Yaos as your archenemy, would I still fear you? If worst comes to worst, this father can just go to the Yaos.”</p><p>“You…”</p><p>This was the move Tang Dong most feared. His Seaside Strait Manor may be a little stronger than Gao Yanfeng’s Wine Garden. However, if they were to fight, even if he exterminated him, the Seaside Strait Manor would suffer heavy losses as well.</p><p>On the other hand, if he were to use the Tang Family’s forces, it was highly likely that Gao Yanfeng would be forced to act out of desperation and thus pledge allegiance to the Yao Family. The Yaos would certainly accept such a powerful dog as well. Going further, if Gao Yanfeng brought the Yaos to Jingmen Island, it would be harder for his Seaside Strait Manor to survive.</p><p>Looking at the two, Fatty Ji chuckled and smiled, “Tang Dong! Gao Yanfeng bought that island, and he wants to establish a large-scale aquaculture around the island. But if your Seaside Strait Manor go through there, won’t he incur some losses? Hence, I suggest that both of you take a step back. Gao Yanfeng must permit you to use the navigational route, and you must give him some compensation. Thus, the issue is solved.”</p><p>“What compensation?” Tang Dong asked.</p><p>“Gao Yanfeng had already said his bottom line before you came.” Fatty Ji said, “The breeding aquafarm he’s about to build is very big, and the total investment would be in the billions. If your Seaside Strait Manor can compensate him 200 million yuan annually, and give him one dead fierce beast every time you hunt, he will permit you to use the navigational route. How about it?”</p><p>“Cut the crap with his unrealistic demand!” Tang Dong was furious and bellowed, “My brothers at the Seaside Strait Manor take great risks going to the Evil Dragon Sea Area and hunting those fierce beasts. Every time they go hunting they will spend many days and are barely able to hunt one. If we have to give one to Gao Yanfeng, doesn’t it mean that we will have nothing to eat? And that 200 million annual compensation, you’re crazy if you think I’ll give you money!”</p><p>Banging the table with his palm, Gao Yanfeng stood up and shouted, “You don’t agree? Then your Seaside Strait Manor should just find another navigational route. This father will go back to my island to start building the aquaculture farms.”</p><p>“Hey, you two, sit down!” Fatty Ji squinted his eyes and said loudly.</p><p>Inside the VIP lounge in the main building.</p><p>Tang Xiu accompanied Gu Yan’er tasting various delicious dishes. Gu Yan’er was like a small greedy cat, yelling while sipping two mouthfuls of wine. Tang Xiu had brought two boxes of wine from his villa in South Gate Town, thus, he took out a bottle and poured half a cup for her.</p><p>“You can only drink this much.”</p><p>“You’re too stingy, Master.” Gu Yan’er’s eyes sparkled and said with a smile, “I drank two jars of Gods Nectar in one breath back then in the Immortal World. You also know about that wine, don’t you? Those two jars were drunk by me alone, and I didn’t even get drunk!”</p><p>“This time is different.” Tang Xiu shook his head and said, “You are now currently injured, thus you cannot drink too much. I can only give you half a cup. It’s already extravagant. All right, just drink it and let’s continue eating. I’ll take you out to enjoy the night view.”</p><p>Feeling sweet inside, Gu Yan’er gobbled up the half cup of Gods Nectar and then said in astonishment, “Master, the taste of this wine is kinda familiar. Ah, no. It seems to be missing something, though.”</p><p>“I made the recipe myself.” Tang Xiu said with a smile, “So it’s natural that you’re familiar with its taste. However, I did substitute some of the materials, though. It’s a lot worse, so it does taste like something is missing.”</p><p>Gu Yan’er suddenly understood. She then looked at the packaging box, and then shifted her eyes to the bottle. After that, she curiously asked, “Master, you opened a winery, didn’t you?”</p><p>“Smart.” Tang Xiu laughed and said, “I have indeed opened a winery, and it’s very profitable now.”</p><p>“True that. A winery opened by Master, how wouldn’t it be profitable?” Gu Yan’er said and let out a sweet smile, “If no one buys it, it means they are stupid!”</p><p>“Alright, come. Let’s eat!” Tang Xiu used his chopstick to clamp a dish and put it into Gu Yan’er’s bowl.</p><p>Quickly, the duo felt full of food and wine. With Gu Yan’er clutching his arm, the duo then came outside the main building. As they saw the scene outside, Gu Yan’er then smiled and said, “Haven’t you dispersed yet? Well… so many of you returned?”</p><p>“Paying respect to Boss!”</p><p>Those who came back from the outside saluted reverentially.</p><p>Gu Yan’er waved her hand and said, “Off with the ceremony! From now henceforth, you all must behave and listen to my Master’s commands! He is the highest ruler of the Everlasting Feast Hall, and his will shall be your will.”</p><p>“Affirmative!” All of them answered again.</p><p>Gu Yan’er then said, “All right! All of you are dismissed! Don’t affect the restaurant’s normal operations.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
