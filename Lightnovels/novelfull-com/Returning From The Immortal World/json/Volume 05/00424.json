The venue set up a high threshold and the prices were costly; even the riches found it difficult to have a chance to dine there.</p><p>7 PM.</p><p>A white Porsche stopped outside Long’s Dining Hall’s entrance; a tall, stately handsome youth in a famous brand suit quietly sat on the car’s hood. He was holding a Blue Enchantress Rose, while there was also a large bouquet of beautiful roses in his roadster.</p><p>“Young Master Chen, could you move your car? We have many guests coming tonight, so parking your car here will affect them.” Several distressed-looking security guards, including the captain, looked at the youth helplessly.</p><p>Had it been someone else, they would have driven him away. But the one before them was the second young master of Blue City’s Simao Group, the little Boss of the Simao Group branch in Star City. At the same time, his father was also one of the shareholders of the Long’s Dining Hall.</p><p>A smile was drawn on the corner of Chen Si’en's mouth as he slowly pulled out a cigarette from his pocket. After taking one and lighting it up, he took a deep puff and threw the pack to the captain. He then smiled and said, “Brother Qiang, I would have complied if it were some other matter. But tonight is very important to me. If anything, just turn a blind eye this time; you can consider it as me owing you a favor! As long as I can take my little angel tonight, I’ll tell your Chief to double your salary.”</p><p>The captain’s eyes lit up. A smile immediately appeared on his face, as he nodded and said with a smile, “If so, we wish Young Master Chen’s lovely dream will come true.”</p><p>After saying that, he motioned the other security guards, who were also smiling. The group retreated and continued their duty.</p><p>Chen Si’en smiled faintly. His eyes then shifted toward the Long’s Dining Hall’s entrance, the anticipation on his face growing. At this moment, when his cigarette was about to burn out in his finger, a petite, Lolita-like face -- like an angel -- wearing a ponytail, walked from the inside. Behind the girl, two beautiful girls followed her.</p><p>Shit, how could he be here?</p><p>Just as Andy walked out of Long’s Dining Hall’s entrance, she saw Chen Si’en stamping on a cigarette butt and approaching her smilingly. Her brows slightly furrowed, and a disgruntled expression appeared on her face.</p><p>While holding the Blue Enchantress Rose, Chen Si’en stopped in front of Andy and magically pulled out a red heart-shaped locket. He knelt on one knee before Andy while attempting to reveal the most charming smile he could pull off. He then affectionately said, “Andy, honey, you’ve rejected me 65 times before, but I believe that good things and good people should be in pairs. On this 66th time, I hope you can give your word to marry me. I, Chen Si’en, swear to you that I’ll only love you, to have you as the one and only woman for the entirety of my life. Please marry me.”</p><p>He gently opened the red heart-shaped locket’s lid, and a two-carat diamond ring immediately reflected a dazzling brilliance under the light.</p><p>Andy retreated a step and indignantly said, “Chen Si’en, have you finished yet? I told you many times I have no feelings for you. You’re not the Prince Charming on a white horse in my mind. No! I won’t marry you.”</p><p>“But why?”</p><p>The smile on Chen Si’en’s face froze. However, he still knelt on one knee and asked persistently, “Why do you always reject me? I don’t care if you don’t have feelings for me now. I believe I’ll obtain your love in time.”</p><p>Andy didn’t speak for a while. Suddenly, a sly glint flashed in her eyes. She then said with a smile, “You want to know why? All right, I’ll tell you then. It’s because my mother in heaven once came to me in my dream. She said that I must never marry an Asian man, especially a man of Chinese descent.”</p><p>That was an excuse! An absolutely absurd, made up excuse.</p><p>Chen Si’en blanched. Even the few passing guests and guards could tell that that was a made up excuse.</p><p>“Well, Andy, this is very interesting.”</p><p>Ten meters away from the roadside, Tang Xiu threw the car keys to a security guard, while speaking in an undertone voice to Kang Xia, who was beside him.</p><p>Kang Xia chuckled and covered her mouth, saying, “That girl’s made up excuse is not enough to swallow by anyone’s brains. Even fools can tell.”</p><p>“I can tell that she did that on purpose to let that handsome fella hear it.” Tang Xiu smiled</p><p>“That Chen Si’en is really persistent. I only know that he’s been courting Andy, asking her to marry him, and always got rejected. Yet, every time after he got rejected, he adamantly persists. Umm, what was that ancient saying again? Ah, that’s right. Keep on fighting despite continual setbacks. That’s precisely the kind of man he is.”</p><p>“Not all can be by the books!” Tang Xiu laughed and said, “Besides, a man must have audacity, thick skin, be dauntless, and persevere to obtain success in his endeavor. Only then will he be able to hold the belle in his embrace.”</p><p>With a smiling expression, Kang Xia said, “Wow, I didn’t think you read love stories, Boss! Regardless, I think Chen Si’en is hopeless, though. If Andy does have a tad of feeling for him, however small it may be, she would have probably agreed a long time ago already. You have met Andy quite a few times already, haven’t you? You should have seen about her bold, dare to hate and dare to love character.”</p><p>“Who am I to have the rights to say so, anyway?” Tang Xiu shrugged and chuckled, “The sincerity that youth is showcasing will maybe eventually touch Andy’s heart! What shall we do then? Should we let bygones be bygones? Or should we wait?”</p><p>While holding Tang Xiu’s left wrist, Kang Xia then looked at the world-famous brand watch Tang Xiu was wearing. After putting his wrist down, she said, “Anyways, there are only 20 minutes left before the start of the celebration party. Let’s go now! Or else the party will be delayed.”</p><p>Tang Xiu nodded and started forward.</p><p>At this time, Andy was looking at Chen Si’en’s frozen face with a satisfaction. She thought that she was a genius to have thought up such a splendid excuse. She then intentionally revealed a pitiful look to make Chen Si’en give up, “Chen Si’en, Young Master Chen, I beg you to give me up! There’s an old saying in China that filial piety is of the most important of all things. I myself am very filial, though I have no one to be filial to. Nevertheless, I can’t marry you, no matter if you ask me 60 times or 6000 times.”</p><p>“Andy, I really like you. I love you.” Chen Si’en bitterly said, “Can you not reject me with such an absurd, made up excuse? For you, I can do anything and everything. I’m willing to give up all, no matter what it is. Promise me, please! I will use the rest of my life to spoil you and love you dearly.”</p><p>\"Andy!\"</p><p>Kang Xia and Tang Xiu appeared.</p><p>Andy looked up. After she glanced at Kang Xia, her eyes then landed on Tang Xiu. She stared blankly at him for a while, as a splendor then burst from her eyes. In the next moment, she gaped with eyes filled with disbelief. However, in next to no time and without much her expression changing, she then winked and her expression changed to love-struck.</p><p>“Hey, don’t stare blankly like that! The man is sincerely proposing you.” Tang Xiu laughed and said, “Tell him you agree if you like him! From the looks of him, he seems to be pretty good too.”</p><p>Andy gulped her saliva down, as she strode toward Tang Xiu and pulled his hand, excitedly exclaiming, “Wow, you’re so gorgeous today, Boss! You’re like the knight in a shining armor that appears in my dreams!”</p><p>Having said that, she seemed to recall something. After loosening Tang Xiu’s hand, and under Tang Xiu’s gaze that seemed at a loss whether to cry or laugh, she strode back to Chen Si’en. She then snatched the Blue Enchantress Rose from his hand and then strode back to Tang Xiu. Kneeling on one of her knees, she supinely said, “Boss, I just realized that I’m in love with you. Please marry… ah, no, please accept me!”</p><p>“…”</p><p>A series of black, heavy lines appeared on Tang Xiu’s forehead.</p><p>Kang Xia was at a loss whether she had to be amused or angry when she looked at Andy and shook her head secretly.</p><p>At the other side, Chen Si’en, who was still kneeling, had his complexion suddenly change. He suddenly stood up and angrily yelled, “Andy, what the hell do you mean by this? That rose is for you. How can you…”</p><p>Andy turned around and smiled gorgeously, “Young Master Chen, thanks a lot for the rose. I’m borrowing it to present it as a gift to my knight. I hope I can get your blessings as well. Do you see him? He’s the prince charming I’ve always been dreaming of. The handsome, gorgeous man who has hit my heart as though a deer shot by a hunter.”</p><p>Having said that, she looked at Tang Xiu again and sweetly smiled, “Boss, please give me a chance. I really like you, I really love you. For you, I can do anything and everything. I’m willing to give up all, no matter what it is. Promise me, please! I will use the rest of my life to spoil you and love you dearly.”</p><p>\"...\"</p><p>Stunned and dumbfounded, never had Tang Xiu imagined that Andy would play such a game. Those words were exactly a copy-paste of what that Chen Si’en guy had just said.</p><p>Queer expressions appeared on each and every one of the onlookers. They never expected that such a dramatic change would unexpectedly unfold.</p><p>“Wow, what an interesting twist! Young people nowadays really have a good time playing! If that little girl Andy didn’t refuse Chen Si’en and did it on purpose, I’m afraid she would really fall into that handsome lad who arrived late.”</p><p>“The man does his utmost to court a woman but is separated by a mountain, yet the woman herself pursues another man. I don’t know whether the man who arrived late will agree.”</p><p>“Shit, Chen Si’en is just out of the game!”</p><p>\"...\"</p><p>Hearing the animated chatter from the onlookers around him, Chen Si’en’s countenance turned more and more unsightly. Never once in his wildest dreams did he thought he would come across somebody to unexpectedly show up and disrupt his plan. Nevertheless, little did he expect that Andy would disregard his face and pursue another man right in front of him. Furthermore, she also did it just at the moment he seriously proposed to her.</p><p>Shame! It was like a scourge and calamity struck his heart. His heart was smashed and shred to pieces at the same time, causing a heartrending and piercing pain inside him.</p><p>“Andy, who the hell is he?”</p><p>Chen Si’en couldn’t deny that this young man in front of him was indeed very elegant and handsome; especially his dress and his demeanor. That made him a bit envious and jealous. Still, regardless of who the young man was, he was his biggest rival, his biggest enemy.</p><p>If possible, he really hoped that he would be able to kill this guy. So that this fellow could never appear in front of Andy again.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
