Although he basically didn’t get himself involved in the operational management of the Magnificent Tang Corp, however, he had read the information about the company’s top executives on the’ profiles Kang Xia gave him. Therefore, he could remember everyone’s names, positions, and their traits and characteristics.</p><p>At this time, dozens of senior executives below the platform looked surprised, as it was hard for them to believe that Tang Xiu was their Boss. After all, Tang Xiu was way too young; even though he was very charmingly handsome and energetic.</p><p>“This is our Boss? Chief Kang is joking with us, right? This young man looks to be in his early 20s. How could he be our Boss?”</p><p>“Is it a mistake or something? He can’t be our Boss, right? He’s way too young.”</p><p>“It’s indeed rumored that our company’s Boss is very young. But to think he’s this young, this is unbelievable. Looking at his age, he seems to be a university student, right?”</p><p>“I heard that all the products of our corporation were researched and developed by our Big Boss. But he’s too young. How could he develop so many products?”</p><p>\"...\"</p><p>Amidst everyone’s incredulous babblering, Kang Xia let out an enchanting smile, as she stood in front of the microphone, and then looked at Tang Xiu. She then chuckled and said, “Everyone, you’re not mistaken. He’s our Magnificent Tang Corp’s Big Boss, Mr. Tang Xiu. I know that each and every one of you is very surprised and shocked. Regardless, however young he may be, he’s indeed the Magnificent Tang Corp’s Big Boss.</p><p>“You should’ve already learned that our Boss is usually very low-key and doesn’t manage the operations of the company. It is not that he doesn’t want to handle it, but it’s because he’s very busy. Apart from the Magnificent Tang Corp’s businesses, our Boss also has another business to manage. Therefore, if you have the ambition to step on a bigger stage, our Boss will give you the chance to have a more glorious and better future as well.</p><p>“And now, let’s have a few words from our Boss.”</p><p>While looking at Kang Xia, who gave him the speaking position, Tang Xiu immediately let out a smile. His eyes slowly swept across the audience, as he then said, “I’m aware of the current development of Magnificent Tang Corporation. Likewise, I’m also very clear about the contribution made by all of you until now. I have to admit that I’m very relieved to have handed over the company management affairs to Kang Xia, so I hope that all of you can strictly adhere and obey her instructions. Shortly put, her commands are on my behalf and are my commands as well. If… in case someone dares to disobey orders or abuses your power to seek personal gain, you will be directly driven away from the Magnificent Tang Corporation.</p><p>“Speaking of this, those who are competent will be to stay, and those who are not will be dismissed. If you’re competent and able, the Magnificent Tang Corporation will give you a bigger stage for you to showcase yourself, as well as present you with an infinite future.”</p><p>After Tang Xiu spoke up to there, he took a moment of silence, as he then slowly said once again, “Last but not least, I would speak to you about tonight’s celebration banquet for our Magnificent Tang Corporation, for which is the recognition and approval of all of your achievements. Therefore, I hereby announce an increase in all senior executives’ salaries by 10%.”</p><p>Whoosh…</p><p>Right as Tang Xiu’s voice fell, dozens of top executives of the Magnificent Tang Corp looked pleasantly surprised as they looked at Tang Xiu with fervor and enthusiasm.</p><p>For them, Tang Xiu’s words of recognition were not at all on par with the money reward. They were all top executives of the Magnificent Tang Corp, and their salaries were already very good. Added with the bonuses, their salaries were already much higher than those of other big corporations. With the 10% increase now, the amount would surely increase even more.</p><p>Clap, clap, clap…</p><p>Unbeknownst to all as to whom took the lead, all top executives in the entire banquet hall suddenly applauded simultaneously, making a loud and thunderous sound.</p><p>Following that, Tang Xiu gave his speech position to Kang Xia and left the stage.</p><p>“First of all, I’m grateful and thankful to the Boss for his generosity. I believe everyone will work much more energetically in the future, right? Nevertheless, I hope that with the joint efforts of everyone in the future, our Magnificent Tang Corporation’s businesses will grow bigger and bigger. I hope to see our company go international and expand into every corner of the world.</p><p>“Well, since tonight is our celebration party, without further ado, everyone can start to eat and drink.”</p><p>After saying that, Kang Xia motioned for Andy.</p><p>With a smile hanging on the corner of her mouth, Andy came to the stage and said with a smile, “Well, Boss and Chief Kang didn’t convey many words to us, but everyone must be very happy, right? Then, let tonight’s party start!!”</p><p>Soft and gentle crystal lights shined in every corner of the hall.</p><p>As the Magnificent Tang Corp’s Boss, Tang Xiu was naturally the person most sought out by everyone. Almost every top executive of the company came to Tang Xiu, wanting to talk with him and show themselves before their Boss. To everyone’s surprise, Tang Xiu could accurately say each of their names, their positions, as well as recognized and encouraged them all for their works.</p><p>Half an hour later, a beautiful music reverberated, as the lights in the banquet hall turned colorful, multicolored lights that were a common part of every party -- the ball.</p><p>Dancing. It was something Tang Xiu was not good at.</p><p>Regardless, he still complied when Kang Xia invited him. Under Kang Xia’s instructions, he only spent a small effort to turn himself into a qualified dancing partner.</p><p>Bam…</p><p>The Jadewater Hall’s front door was trampled open, as more than 20 big men and a handsome young man aggressively stormed into the banquet hall, akin to ferocious wolves or tigers. The dancing top executives of the Tang Magnificent Corp had their expressions slightly changed. As the lights turned brighter, everyone’s eyes landed on Chen Si’en, who was walking throught the front door.</p><p>Tang Xiu slightly furrowed his brows and released Kang Xia’s supple, slender waist. He then strode toward Chen Si’en, whose expression was full of provocation.</p><p>“Did you come here to make trouble?” Tang Xiu’s voice was chilling.</p><p>Upon seeing Tang Xiu, Chen Si’en looked like he saw a mortal enemy.. His eyes turned scarlet, as tightly gripped his fists and ferociously glared at Tang Xiu, “Yes! I came here to make trouble! Where’s Andy? Get her here to see me!”</p><p>Andy walked over from the sideways. She then pointed at Chen Si’en and shouted, “Chen! Si’en! It seems like you were beaten too lightly by me, huh? SCRAM! Or else, don’t blame me if I beat you once again.”</p><p>Chen Si’en’s eyes twitched, and the anger in his eyes turned thicker. He stared at Andy and scornfully shouted, “Andy, there’s something you don’t know. This Chen Si’en has never failed to get something I want, never. Tonight I’ll give you a choice. Come with me, or I will smite this punk you call Boss. You only have half a minute to think.”</p><p>\"You…\"</p><p>Glancing at the big and powerful men Chen Si’en brought, a timid look appeared on Andy’s face. However, as she recalled that Tang Xiu was there, the look quickly vanished. Just as she was about to speak, Tang Xiu stopped her.</p><p>While looking at Kang Xia, Tang Xiu chuckled and said, “How much are the clothes I'm wearing now?”</p><p>“Excluding the watch, all of them amount to almost 300 thousand.” Clueless as to what Tang Xiu had in mind, Kang Xia still replied respectfully.</p><p>Tang Xiu nodded, as his gaze then shifted to Chen Si’en. He smiled lightly and said, “Did you hear it? The price of my clothes is about 300 thousand yuan. If it were to be stained by blood this evening, I’d have to throw it out. Furthermore, the clothes I’m wearing cost at least a hundred times that. So, have you decided yet? Fail in provoking me, and not only will you make a fool of yourself, you’ll also get retribution, plus 30 million in compensation for the loss of my clothes.”</p><p>\"Hahaha...\"</p><p>Chen Si’en laughed maniacally. Then, he said loudly, full of sarcasm, “You’re mad. Do you think you can be arrogant before me just because you’re the Magnificent Tang Corp’s Boss? Can’t you see what kind of situation you are in now? Hmph… you’re just an idiot in my eyes.”</p><p>At this time, the Magnificent Tang Corp’s top executives looked furious.</p><p>They were all the Magnificent Tang Corp’s top executives. For Chen Si’en to humiliate their Boss, it was akin to humiliating themselves. Although many of them knew that Chen Si’en was powerful in Star City, but they didn’t have a good impression of him. After all, Chen Si’en had repeatedly come to the company just to pursue Andy, which caused many to loathe him.</p><p>Additionally, their Big Boss, Tang Xiu, had just increased their salaries. Hence, many of them prepared to call the police.</p><p>The slight smile on Tang Xiu’s face receded like a tidal wave. He calmly observed Chen Si’en’s domineering and arrogant act, and then asked, “Are you finished?”</p><p>“I’m done. Let Andy choose by herself.” Chen Si’en scornfully sneered, “Even if she chooses to go with me tonight, you will still end up beaten. You’ll obediently lie on the hospital bed for months.”</p><p>“Wow, I was originally hesitating as whether to give you a beating.” Tang Xiu gave him a thumbs-up and sighed, “But since you said this, I won’t stand on ceremony anymore.”</p><p>The moment he finished speaking, Tang Xiu instantly appeared in front of Chen Si’en, his fists straightly punching Chen Si’en’s face lightning fast.</p><p>A strong and agile figure suddenly appeared in front of Chen Si’en. It was a man with stocky bear-like hips and tiger-like back - Qiu Jian - who was blocking Tang Xiu’s punch with his own fists. Despite being strong, his staggered backward after his fists clashed with Tang Xiu’s. His staggering posture hit Chen Si’en behind him and almost made him fall to the floor. His complexion drastically changed, yet he stayed in shape and stood firmly still, his eagle-like eyes fixedly staring at Tang Xiu.</p><p>Tang Xiu slightly furrowed his brows, as he stood still and didn’t move in the slightest. He looked at Qiu Jian with astonishment. He had never thought that this guy’s strength and speed would be unexpectedly this powerful. Had it been an average person with several hundred pounds weigh daring to resist his punch, they would have easily been sent flying.</p><p>However, he didn’t hesitate even for a bit. After Qiu Jian’s figure stood firm, he dashed forward again. This time, he increased his speed and strength and instantly appeared in front of Qiu Jian. He shot a strong punch at Qiu Jian’s face. As the man was sent flying upside down, Tang Xiu raised his leg to kick Qiu Jian’s waist. Right after Qiu Jian was sent flying, Tang Xiu’s figure appeared once again in front of Chen Si’en.</p><p>“You still dare to act arrogantly, despite bringing these worthless trash?”</p><p>Tang Xiu grabbed Chen Si’en’s shirt and immediately slapped him dozens of times. After beating him into a pig-headed state, he kicked him in the stomach and sent him flying backward eight meters away, as he then landed and fainted on the floor.</p><p>“Get him!”</p><p>Upon seeing such a scene, the 20 big men brought by Chen Si’en instantly stormed toward Tang Xiu.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
