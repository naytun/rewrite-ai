Security guards and passing visitors shot them strange looks as they came to the clothes section on the fourth floor.</p><p>“Kang Xia, my clothes are good enough! Besides, it’s just an evening banquet, no need to make a fuss about it.” Tang Xiu forced a smile.</p><p>“Boss, tonight is your first time appearing in front of the company’s executives, hence, the overall image is very important.” Kang Xia said with a smile, “People may not say it, but it’s the clothes that makes a man. Though you got good looks, these clothes you’re wearing are way too shabby; there’s no way you can radiate your light with that.”</p><p>“I’m not a superstar, why would I need to radiate a light anyway?” Tang Xiu reluctantly said.</p><p>“To impress all the company’s executives, of course you need to radiate a brilliant light.” Kang Xia seriously said, “After all, you’re the company’s Big Boss. If you don’t pay attention to your image, the executives will look down on you. Besides, I don’t think you want to be despised by your own employees, right?”</p><p>\"This…\" Tang Xiu gaped, as he forced a smile and nodded.</p><p>“That’s it, then!” Kang Xia smiled and said, “You just need to listen to me today. We’ll first buy some clothes, shoes, tie, and boss’s outfit. Then I’ll take you to see someone to make sure that you dress up as handsomely as a jade tree. A man that radiates brilliance!”</p><p>“You couldn’t be thinking on make me as charming as a fox-spirit, could you?” Tang Xiu said in an undertone voice.</p><p>“Pfft… Hahaha!”</p><p>Kang Xia couldn’t help covering her mouth as she laughed as she dragged Tang Xiu and entered a luxurious outfit store.</p><p>Shopping, as it had always been, was a happy time for women. Especially when they were accompanied by their lovers. But for men, the endeavor was somewhat a torture, even if it was to buy stuff for themselves.</p><p>Dragged by Kang Xia, Tang Xiu spent a full two hours scouring the clothing store, trying more than 20 sets of suits, as, at the end of the day, only two sets were purchased. But the price for them was akin to squandering money to Tang Xiu, making him feel bad for a while.</p><p>Six digits! Both suits were well above six digits. Even though he seemed to be a changed man, and the clothes were good to wear after he put them on, he felt uncomfortable. He felt like he was not wearing clothes, but hundreds yuan paper money.</p><p>5 PM, at a private club. Tang Xiu was taken by Kang Xia there. From the looks of its door, the private club was extraordinary, with a high-class and stylish decoration style.</p><p>“Welcome!”</p><p>Two welcoming ladies greeted them as Kang Xia and Tang Xiu came to a spacious hall inside. At this time, two middle-aged women in graceful dresses were inside the hall, sitting on the soft sofa while reading a fashion magazine and chatting from time to time.</p><p>Beside them was a man in green trousers, a red vest, a duckbill cap, an air of femininity with makeup as he fiddled with a suit of clothes.</p><p>\"Anthony!\" Kang Xia shouted.</p><p>As the feminine man turned his head and saw Kang Xia, his eyes immediately lit up as he cheerfully greeted, smilingly saying in an especially greasy voice, “Kang Xia, babe! What a rare guest! To think you unexpectedly came, what’s up?”</p><p>Kang Xia smiled and said, “Anthony, let me introduce you to this man. He’s my Boss, Tang Xiu. Boss, he’s Anthony, the owner of this costume fashion clubhouse, and also the Chief of Fashion Stylist here. He’s very skillful, as most of the ladies, Bosses, and nouveau-riches in Star City are very fond of looking for him to help with their fashion and appearance images. Even some Star City’s superstars come to him for help.”</p><p>Tang Xiu nodded, \"Hello!\"</p><p>A splendor flashed in Anthony’s eyes as he sized up Tang Xiu. He then repeatedly nodded and sighed in praise, “A natural frame for clothes, and good looking appearance. For me, he’s simply a piece of unpolished gem that’s not have undergone any sculpting. After carrying out the transformation, I’ll definitely be able to cast off the dust on the jade and show its dazzling and magnificent radiance. Kang Xia, babe, you’ve brought me a good material.”</p><p>“Hey, do you want to die, Anthony? He’s my Boss! What the heck are you seeing him as material for? I’ll rip your mouth off if you dare talk rubbish again.” Kang Xia snappily said.</p><p>“Ah, my bad, my bad. Consider it I as if I didn’t had said anything.” Anthony laughed and said, “Besides, to think that The Magnificent Tang Corp’s Big Boss, a big shot who is akin to a divine dragon whose tail and head are nowhere to be seen, condescended to come to my small sanctuary today. This quite excited me, you know. Anyhow, for such a super client, how about I give you a 20% discount today?”</p><p>“That’s really terrific.” Kang Xia raised her thumb and said, “Let’s get started, then!”</p><p>Letting out a faint smile, Anthony then took the two suits, shoes and socks, and then said with a smile at Tang Xiu, “Mr. Tang, please come with me!”</p><p>Tang Xiu nodded slightly and followed Anthony into the next room.</p><p>On the sofa.</p><p>The two middle-aged ladies, who had continued reading the fashion magazines and did not paid attention to Kang Xia and Tang Xiu when they came in, suddenly looked astonished when they heard Anthony saying that Tang Xiu was the Magnificent Tang Corp’s Big Boss.</p><p>“My God! I never thought that the Magnificent Tang Corp’s Big Boss would be such a handsome young man. My hubby has been talking about this Magnificent Tang Corp’s Boss all day recently, lamenting that he has never seen him. Even until now, he hasn’t been able to figure out who exactly the Magnificent Tang Corp’s Boss is.”</p><p>“Yea! The topic my husband has been talking the most is about this company group and its mysterious Big Boss. That’s right, it’s said that the Magnificent Tang Corp’s CEO is Kang Xia. Is that woman Kang Xia? I think I’ve seen her in finance and economics interviews before.”</p><p>“From the looks of it, their relationship seems to be unusual!”</p><p>“Regardless of their relationship, we can see the Magnificent Tang Corp’s Big Boss today. If anything, we must take a picture with him. My hubby will surely treat me specially well after I gift it to him.”</p><p>“Yeah, I also want one!”</p><p>As for Kang Xia, she walked to the bookshelf and randomly picked up a fashion magazine. She then went to sit on the opposite side of the two ladies. After realizing that they were both looking at her, she nodded and smiled at them, and then began to read. Half an hour later, when the next room’s door was opened, Anthony came out from and immediate clapped to awaken Kang Xia from reading the magazine.</p><p>“Anthony, how’s my Boss?”</p><p>Putting down the fashion magazine, Kang Xia got up and walked toward Anthony.</p><p>Anthony let out a faint smile. As he was about to clap his hands, Tang Xiu’s figure appeared in front of Kang Xia.</p><p>“God! Is this really my Boss?”</p><p>Kang Xia looked dazed, and then quickly rubbed her eyes to make sure that she wasn’t mistaken. She suddenly called out, “Boss, you were just a young, handsome guy, but now, you’re definitely top-notch! A man that countless women dream about!”</p><p>In the sofa nearby.</p><p>The two ladies also looked dazed. They couldn’t help but sit straight, looking dull and blank as they gaped and stared at Tang Xiu, who looked as though he had transformed into another man.</p><p>Handsome! Flawless!</p><p>They had met many handsome and manly men before, but none were more elegant and exuded more manliness than the one in front of them.</p><p>Tang Xiu was wearing a tuxedo and a tie, with shiny leather shoes and stylish hairdo. A luxury watch wrapped around his wrist. He exuded an extraordinary bearing.</p><p>“What? What’s wrong?” Tang Xiu looked down at his clothes and wondered in surprise.</p><p>“No, it’s just… well, too dazzling.” Kang Xia shook her head and murmured, “Boss, if you were to become a star, all the girls in the world will surely be bewitched by you.”</p><p>“What a big joke.” Tang Xiu couldn’t help laughing and said, “If I have that ability, some rich women would have taken care of me as their secret lover.”</p><p>“I’ll take and keep you!”</p><p>As Tang Xiu’s voice fell, in next to no time, the lady whose eyes shined loudly said, “Handsome, I’ll pour out all of my savings to keep you.”</p><p>“Pfft… Hahaha...”</p><p>“Hahaha…”</p><p>Kang Xia and Anthony couldn’t help but burst into laughter.</p><p>Tang Xiu was at a loss whether to cry or laugh as he looked at the lady. He then shook his head and said, “Elder sister, you’re jesting me. I’m not accustomed to being supported by others.”</p><p>Having said that, he grabbed Kang Xiu’s hand and headed toward the entrance. Only then did he loosen Kang Xia’s hand and said, “You did it on purpose, didn’t you?”</p><p>“I swear to God I didn’t!” Kang Xia grinned and said, “But, Hahaha… Boss, did you see the eyes of those two elder sisters just now? What color did you see in their eyes? Green! Their eyes were filled with green. Now, do you realize how big your charm is?”</p><p>“I don’t know. But thinking of people wanting to raise me up as their secret young lover gives me goosebumps.” Tang Xiu snappily said, “Let’s leave quickly. I want to find a place to change my clothes!”</p><p>“No no no!” Kang Xia quickly pulled Tang Xiu, shaking her head again and again, “It wasn’t easy for me to make Antony help you design your fashion style. Besides, we would make this ‘pressing business’ in vain for the half afternoon if you were to change your clothes. That’s right, I haven’t paid Anthony yet! Wait for me here, Boss.”</p><p>“Okay, okay!” Tang Xiu forced a smile and said, “Then I won’t change, all right? Just release me, will ya?”</p><p>Only now did Kang Xia release Tang Xiu, as she ran smilingly toward the front door. Tang Xiu could only smile wryly while shaking his head. He then walked to the car’s front, took out a cigarette, lit it up, and then heaved two deep puffs. Though he looked helpless on the surface, he felt somewhat proud and happy inside. To think that he could even charm a middle-aged woman, that meant his looks were not bad, right?!</p><p>As always, it’s indeed that the clothes make the man! This saying is really true!</p><p>Tang Xiu flicked his suit on the shoulders. Even though he didn’t look messy and disorderly in the slightest, yet he still produced pressure. A few minutes later, Kang Xia then came out of the building smiling, as she immediately rushed to him and said, “Boss, let me drive!”</p><p>“Have it your way, then!” Tang Xiu nodded and said, “Anyhow, where will we be going next? Shall we go straight to Long’s Dining Hall?”</p><p>“The time to the celebration party is ticking, so I think we gotta catch up!” Kang Xia smiled and said, “I dare guarantee that you’ll be the focus of the audience’s attention, Boss!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
