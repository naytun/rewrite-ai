And due to Kang Xia’s bold decision to use new people, nearly half of them were young men.</p><p>Therefore, after the twenty big men stormed over, several people led by Scarblade Qiang and Wei Zhongfeng chose to act together with Tang Xiu. They grabbed bottles and other items on the table and rushed to clash with the big men. Apart from the women and several timid men, the others went to join the group after a brief hesitation.</p><p>The fight was especially messy and chaotic.</p><p>Tang Xiu himself didn’t expect that these top executives would act. Hence, he moved and acted quickly. Whenever one got injured, he immediately attacked the one who had injured him. After half a minute, the men brought by Chen Si’en were all beaten, while five or six Magnificent Tang Corporation’s top executives suffered minor injuries.</p><p>“Shall we call the police, Boss?” Kang Xia had stopped many from calling the police. At this time, seeing that all the troublemakers had been subdued, she came to Tang Xiu and asked in a low voice.</p><p>“Don’t call the cops.” Tang Xiu shook his head and said, “It isn’t over yet.”</p><p>“But we have people injured. Should we send them to the hospital?” Kang Xia hesitantly nodded and asked.</p><p>Shaking his head again, Tang Xiu then strode toward the injured. He immediately gave them treatment. Some of the top executives had bleeding wounds, and after Tang Xiu gave them simple treatment, their wounds stopped bleeding.</p><p>“Everyone, thank you for acting together with me. After today’s accident, I now realize that our Magnificent Tang Corporation’s top executives are very united and cohesive. Mark my words; whoever dares to bully any of our people, everyone must join hands to deal with them. If the opposite party has a strong background, call me at once; I’m your Boss, I’ll support you.” Tang Xiu looked around and heavily said.</p><p>Having said that, he then went toward the unconscious Chen Si’en. As he picked him up and slapped him a few times to wake him up, he then threw him to the floor as though a dead dog, and then said coldly, “All right, let us continue our talk. You brought your men to disturb the Magnificent Tang Corporation’s party. What you did caused great damage to our company; some top executives of our company even got injured. The medical bills, the time wasted, the mental trauma, and another series of losses we have suffered, how will you compensate us?”</p><p>Chen Si’en shook his head as watched his men all knocked on the floor, huddling and groaning everywhere. Disbelief filled his eyes, as he could hardly believe what he saw. He rubbed his eyes, making sure that he wasn’t seeing mistakenly.</p><p>However, the result was a disappointment, for his twenty men had indeed been completely beaten up.</p><p>“YOU…”</p><p>Chen Si’en’s gaze landed on Tang Xiu as he opened his mouth to speak, yet couldn’t utter any words. He just arrogantly shouted saying that he would make Tang Xiu pay and make him lie down on the hospital bed for months. In the end, however, never had he imagined that it would turn into such a situation.</p><p>Scornfully sneering, Tang Xiu grabbed a bottle of wine. He came to a big man next to Chen Si’en and smashed the bottle on his head. The big man miserably screamed as Tang Xiu grabbed his head, and then smeared his clothes with the man’s blood. Following that, he turned to Chen Si’en and sneered, “You must pay 30 million in compensation for my clothes. Added with the other losses, you must to pay no less than 200 million in compensation. Otherwise, not one of you will leave this banquet hall tonight!”</p><p>200 million?</p><p>Chen Si’en stared blankly, as his anger erupted yet again. He glared at Tang Xiu and got up with difficulty, bellowing angrily, “Surnamed Tang! Don’t go too far! This father can take out 200 million, but do you think you can make it out alive to get it?”</p><p>Pa…</p><p>Tang Xiu slapped him again. He then faced Scarblade Qiang and pointed at a nearby chair. After Scarblade Qiang smilingly moved the chair over, Tang Xiu sat while crossing his legs, and then indifferently said, “Whether I’ll be alive to spend it is my concern, you don’t need to worry about it. I’ll give you two hours. If you don’t pay the 200 million by then, all of you will be beaten again in turns. After several beatings, I’m afraid you’ll be lying in bed for a couple of months.”</p><p>Chen Si’en collapsed on the floor, using one of his hands to cover his face and the other to prop him up off the floor. After trying hard to sit, a fierce, scowling look emerged on his handsome face as he yelled sternly, “Surnamed Tang! You really have balls. Just you wait, just you wait…”</p><p>After roaring, he directly took out his mobile phone and dialed a number, calling out loudly after it was picked up, “Big Brother, the men you sent me were all beaten, and I got beaten up yet again!”</p><p>“Tell me the address!”</p><p>“Long’s Dining Hall, Jadewater Hall.”</p><p>\"Got it!\"</p><p>After hanging up the phone, Chen Si’en glared hatefully toward Tang Xiu, shouting, “Just you wait, surnamed Tang! This matter is not over yet!”</p><p>Glancing at him with contempt and disdain, Tang Xiu turned to Scarblade Qiang and said, “I don’t want to hear him speak anymore. Knock him down!”</p><p>“Got it!”</p><p>As far as Scarblade Qiang was concerned, he was of a powerful bandit background. He grabbed a bottle and directly smashed it on Chen Si’en’s head, making him faint directly.</p><p>Sizemore Hot Spring Center.</p><p>After having just entered the hot spring, a cold glint flashed in Chen Sirui’s eyes, who was already dressed up. After making a phone call, he turned to look at Long Zhenglin, Fei Shan, and Huang Xiu, and lightly said, “I got something to deal with, so I can’t accompany you.”</p><p>Surprised, Long Zhenglin asked, “Where are you going?”</p><p>“My little brother got beaten up again.” Chen Sirui said indifferently, “The men I sent him also got beaten by the opposite party. I have to go to Long’s Dining Hall to see it myself.”</p><p>Long Zhenglin, Fei Shan, and Huang Xu exchanged dismayed glances, yet wore strange expressions on their faces. They didn’t expect that someone would able to clean up the people sent by Chen Sirui, and even so rampantly beat up Chen Si’en.</p><p>Who could have such boldness? Who could be so rampant?</p><p>After pondering for a short while, Long Zhenglin then said, “Young Master Chen, you are someone I, Long Zhenglin, has invited to Star City. So your little brother is also my younger brother. If anything, I’m also a local snake of Star City; thus, I’ll naturally give you a hand as well. Let’s go to Long’s Dining Hall together! I actually want to see the punk who dares to beat up the Second Young Master of the Simao Group.”</p><p>Fei Shan and Huang Xu also said in unison,  “Yea! We’re all buddies. Your business is our business!”</p><p>“Let’s go together!”</p><p>After being silent for a moment, Chen Sirui then nodded and said, “If so, I thank you in advance.”</p><p>An hour afterward, six cars arrived at Long’s Dining Hall’s entrance. As Chen Sirui and the other three got off, fifteen big men in black suits steadily came out from the cars one by one.</p><p>“Yong Master Long, Chen… Young Master Chen. Y-you’ve come.”</p><p>At the gate, the security captain grinned as he strode forward to greet them.</p><p>Giving him a cold snort in response, Chen Sirui ignored the security captain and walked inside. The group’s fierce and aggressive posture aroused the curiosity of many visitors.</p><p>Quickly, two big men pushed the Jadewater Hall’s front door, as Chen Sirui, Long Zhenglin, and the others rushed in in a threatening manner. Their anger turned fiercer after they saw the scene inside.</p><p>The tall and sturdy Long Zhenglin shouted, “Who the fuck got the balls to eat the bear and leopard’s heart? How dare you beat Second Young Master Chen? Get the fuck…”</p><p>Suddenly, his voice came to a halt, his face turning blank.</p><p>Huang Xu and Fei Shan, who were about to curse as well, gaped and wore incredulous looks after they spotted Tang Xiu sitting on a chair inside.</p><p>As for Chen Sirui, he didn’t know Tang Xiu. He only saw his unconscious younger brother, Chen Si’en, who had been beaten up, and looked at the twenty men sent by him lying down on the floor akin to dead dogs. Flames of anger burned crazily inside his heart. However, as a mature and calm person, he didn’t get muddle-headed due to his fury.</p><p>“Are you the one who injured my little brother?”</p><p>Giving him a cold and detached look in response, Tang Xiu’s eyes then moved to Long Zhenglin’s face and indifferently asked, “Well, well, Second Young Master Long, you do get along well with others! Are you going to stand up for this Chen Family too?”</p><p>\"No!\" Long Zhenglin hastily shook his head.</p><p>Chen Sirui stared blankly as he turned to look at Long Zhenglin, who was shaking his head as hard as he could, and frowned deeply.</p><p>Coldly snorting in response, Tang Xiu then looked at Huang Xu and Fei Shan and also asked lightly, “How about the two of you? Do you also want to stand up for the Chen Family?”</p><p>Huang Xu and Fei Shan exchanged looks. The duo forced out a smile at the same time, shaking their heads and saying in unison, “No, we got nothing to do with this matter.”</p><p>“Yea! We won’t meddle in, since you’re involved in this matter!”</p><p>Again, Chen Sirui was stunned and stared blankly. He looked at the Long Zhenglin, Fei Shan, and Huang Xu with an incredulous expression, because the three of them were so eager to help him before, saying that they would help him clean up the enemies. But, to think they were now…</p><p>“Long Zhenglin, Huang Xu, Fei Shan… What the fuck do you mean by this?” Chen Sirui asked with a scowl on his face.</p><p>After staying silent for a short while, Long Zhenglin suddenly said, “Young Master Chen, there’s something you may not be aware of. Your younger brother provoked the Magnificent Tang Corporation. Despite I myself not having something big, yet I also have a certain business under the Magnificent Tang Corp’s flag, and I also have small shares of the stock. So if your Chen Family is going to deal with the Magnificent Tang Corp, that means you will have to deal with me as well. If you really want to have a go, then don’t blame me for clashing with you without sparing consideration for face.”</p><p>Stunned and shocked, Chen Sirui didn’t expect that these people would be from the Magnificent Tang Corp. Suddenly, as if recalling something, his gaze then shifted toward Kang Xia, who was standing next to Tang Xiu, and his expression suddenly changed.</p><p>“Are you… Tang Xiu?”</p><p>“Never thought that a nobody such as I would be known to Young Master Chen.” Tang Xiu said lightly, “Should I feel flattered and honored or something?”</p><p>Chen Sirui finally understory why did Long Zhenglin, Fei Shan, and Huang Xu betray him. They had known Tang Xiu before, and even had a bit of friendship with him. In particular Long Zhenglin, for he was definitely on Tang Xiu’s side. If he were to clash with Tang Xiu, Long Zhenglin would stand on Tang Xiu’s side without a second thought.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
