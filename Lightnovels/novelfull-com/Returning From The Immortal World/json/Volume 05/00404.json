As she saw the situation inside, she said lightly, “My Everlasting Feast Hall provides the box for the guests to dine. Here is not a place where you can behave atrociously. I have sent people to prepare the room next door, so I have to ask you to go there.”</p><p>“Boss Gu, what exactly are we going to do in the next door?” Tang Dong’s brows furrowed.</p><p>Gu Xiaoxue didn’t show any hostility toward Tang Dong. On the contrary, she showed a bit of respect due to the relationship between him and Tang Xiu. “Mr. Tang, I’m not the Everlasting Feast Hall’s owner. The master has changed. As a matter of fact, this is an instruction from our Boss. Please go to the box next door and wait for a while. He will catch up with us soon.”</p><p>“Please lead the way.” Feeling that Gu Xiaoxue didn’t hold any hostility toward him, Tang Dong’s brows raised as he nodded and replied.</p><p>Glancing at Gao Yanfeng and Ji Xiaolong, Gu Xiaoxue then turned around to leave.</p><p>Looking a bit confused, Gao Yanfeng then looked at Ji Xiaolong and asked, “Can you tell me what are the Everlasting Feast Hall’s intentions? Why does the Everlasting Feast Hall want to meddle in the issues between me and the Seaside Strait Manor? Fatty Ji, the Everlasting Feast Hall’s strength is something everyone is unable to unravel! Perhaps even both of us are not necessarily their opponents.”</p><p>Fatty Ji frowned deeply as a cold expression showed on his plump face. He pulled Gao Yanfeng to the outside and whispered, “Don’t talk nonsense. The Everlasting Feast Hall’s dreadfulness is not something our joined forces can match. I’ll tell you something. Just a dozen of their people are enough to exterminate us.”</p><p>“Are you for real?” Gao Yanfeng was horrified. “How do you know?”</p><p>“Forget how I know.” Fatty Ji said in undertone voice, “In any case, you must remember to never provoke the Everlasting Feast Hall. Moreover, you must build friendship with the Everlasting Feast Hall if there’s a chance. Even if… you have to pay a price.”</p><p>Gao Yanfeng knew Fatty Ji’s character. He knew that the man never said anything just to scare people out. However, although the Everlasting Feast Hall did indeed hide some of their strength, could it be that they were really as terrifying as Ji Xiaolong said?</p><p>Thee then went to the box next room with Gu Xiaoxue. The box was twice larger than the previous one and was enough to accommodate dozens of people. At this time, the furniture inside had been removed, and the Everlasting Feast Hall’s staff had unknowingly placed several sofas and placed them against the wall.</p><p>“Gentlemen, please have a seat.” Gu Xiaoxue went straight to the back and directly took the middle seat.</p><p>Although Tang Dong was clueless as to why the Everlasting Feast Hall was intervening in this matter, he actually didn’t feel any hostility from Gu Xiaoxue. Therefore, he felt calm and secure as he sat down on the right side sofa, in front of Gu Xiaoxue. As for Gao Yanfeng and Fatty Ji, they took a seat on the left sofa.</p><p>Fatty Ji’s eyes then fell on Gu Xiaoxue. Despite her breathtaking beauty, he actually didn’t dare to show any dirty actions toward her. He cupped his fists and said, “Elderly Gu…”</p><p>“My name is Gu Xiaoxue!” Gu Xiaoxue said lightly.</p><p>Fatty Ji quickly changed the address and said, “Miss Gu, may I ask who is the current master of the Everlasting Feast Hall?”</p><p>“You’ll naturally know it when our Boss arrives.” Gu Xiaoxue said lightly.</p><p>Forcing out a smile, Fatty Ji knew that it was a pile of rubbish. However, he wanted to clear out his perplexed feeling, as he then asked again, “Miss Gu, we have indeed had a small scuffle in your Everlasting Feast Hall, but it’s just a trivial matter; we had yet to act against each other. We will naturally pay for all the damage done; double. Anyhow, we don’t understand why would your Boss want to see us.”</p><p>Maintaining her indifference expression, Gu Xiaoxue replied with the same words as before, “You’ll naturally know it when our Boss has arrived.”</p><p>Fatty Ji fell into silence.</p><p>For a while, the atmosphere in the box became a bit suffocating.</p><p>“Boss!”</p><p>The Everlasting Feast Hall’s security staff’s voice was heard from outside the box.</p><p>“En!”</p><p>Tang Xiu nodded in response. As he stepped into the box, he could clearly see the situation inside. When his eyes met with Tang Dong’s, he could see the disbelief in them.</p><p>“Boss!”</p><p>Gu Xiaoxue stood and called out as she lightly walked toward Tang Xiu.</p><p>Nodding to her in response, Tang Xiu then walked a few steps toward Tang Dong, who was already standing. He then chuckled and said, “Uncle Dong, I heard you were in the Everlasting Feast Hall, and you even had a conflict with some people. How is it? Have you solved the conflict yet?”</p><p>Tang Dong finally awakened from his shock. He sized up Tang Xiu before he asked in wonderment, “Tang Xiu, you… are you the new owner of the Everlasting Feast Hall?”</p><p>“Can I still be called new?” Tang Xiu chuckled and said, “It’s been several months already.”</p><p>Tang Dong fell into silence for a while before his expression changed. His expression replaced by excitement, he then laughed and said, “Great, great, great. I never thought that the Everlasting Feast Hall’s people turned out to be our own people. At first, I thought that I was at disadvantage, but I really had never thought that it’s like the winding paths along the mountain ridges.”</p><p>At this moment, Gao Yanfeng and Fatty Ji’s expression turned somewhat unsightly. Never in their wildest dreams did they thought that the Everlasting Feast Hall’s master would turn out to be a member of the Tangs.</p><p>Trouble! Big trouble!</p><p>The duo exchanged glances, looking bitter and astringent.</p><p>Tang Xiu nodded as he walked to the seat where Gu Xiaoxue had just vacated. He waved his hand, hinting for everyone to sit down. Following that, he then looked at Gao Yanfeng and Fatty Ji and indifferently said, “I’ll introduce myself. I’m Tang Xiu, the owner of the Everlasting Feast Hall and a member of the Tang Family. How should I address the both of you?”</p><p>Fatty Ji quickly replied, “My name is Ji, Ji Xiaolong. You can call me Fatty Ji.”</p><p>“Gao Yanfeng!” Gao Yanfeng replied in a stiff tone.</p><p>“Now, tell me! What’s the situation?” Tang Xiu said.</p><p>“Tang Xiu, you know that our Seaside Strait Manor has been hunting fierce beasts in that oceanic trench nearby. But due to the recent small earthquake there two months ago, the fierce beasts suddenly disappeared. Out of desperation, our Seaside Strait Manor had no choice but to go to the Evil Dragon Sea Area to hunt some low-rank fierce beasts there. Gao Yanfeng found out about the situation and then, by using some underhanded means, he bought the island in the middle of the navigation route, threatening to build an aquaculture farm there.</p><p>“Thus, he cut off the sea route for our Seaside Strait Manor. Furthermore, he put forth some conditions. However, the price he’s asking is too outrageous; it’s simply extortion. This Fatty Ji, who ostensibly raised the flag as the peacemaker on the surface, turns out to be partial to Gao Yanfeng.”</p><p>Looking at the angry Tang Dong, Tang Xiu let out a smile and said, “It turns out to be such a trivial matter! It’s alright, leave it to me.”</p><p>“How do you plan to solve this?” Tang Dong doubtfully said.</p><p>Giving him a reassuring look, Tang Xiu then looked at Gao Yanfeng and said, “You’re Gao Yanfeng, right? Since you know that I’m a member of the Tang Family, naturally, I’ll also become your enemy. Well, I can also act benevolently toward my enemies, so I’ll give you a chance. You can choose between two options.”</p><p>“The first option: Transfer the island to the Seaside Strait Manor at the price of one yuan.”</p><p>“Impossible!” Gao Yanfeng immediately jumped up and yelled.</p><p>“Then you can only choose the second option.” Tang Xiu said with a pale smile.</p><p>“What’s the second option.” Gao Yanfeng forcefully suppressed his fury and growled.</p><p>Tang Xiu’s figure instantly appeared in front of him as a light blade flashed. Then, Tang Xiu was back to the sofa, saying with a smile, “The second option is your life ending, killed by me on the spot. All of your Wine Garden’s people will be cleaned up and all of your properties will be transferred to me.”</p><p>\"YOU…\"</p><p>Gao Yanfeng lifted his right hand, pointing his finger at Tang Xiu. However, his left hand firmly covered his neck. As he just said “YOU”, a large amount of blood spurted out from the wound.</p><p>“There was a path to heaven, yet you didn’t want to take it. Instead, you adamantly rushed to the gate of hell.” Tang Xiu said with a smile, “Since this is the case, I can only give you the ride myself. That’s right. After you have arrived in hell and the King of Hell asks how you died, do remember to tell him that… I’m called Tang Xiu. He should know who I am, because I already sent him many just like you.”</p><p>The moment Tang Xiu finished speaking, Gao Yanfeng’s hands covered his neck as his body slid off the sofa and fell to the floor.</p><p>Tang Xiu then shifted his eyes to Gu Xiaoxue.</p><p>As intelligent as she was, Gu Xiaoxue immediately understood Tang Xiu’s meaning, and respectfully said, “I’ll take care of it, Grand Master. All of Gao Yanfeng’s forces will be slain and all of his properties will be taken at the shortest time possible.”</p><p>“Take all of his assets, but I don’t want a bloodbath. Let those who are not Gao Yanfeng’s close friends or confidants go!” Tang Xiu said, “Furthermore, it’s quite unfair for the Everlasting Feast Hall to act and deal with the Wine Garden. Let the Everlasting Feast Hall’s people join with the Seaside Strait Manor’s people to deal with it. Thus, the benefits will then be evenly divided. What do you say, Uncle Dong?”</p><p>Shocked by Tang Xiu’s methods, although Tang Dong knew what Tang Xiu had to do to rout the Yaos and the Suns in Guangyang, however, he didn’t witness it personally. But now, Tang Xiu’s cold side when he killed Gao Yanfeng, who he abhorred so much, without batting an eyelid, secretly made him apprehensive.</p><p>“No opinion!”</p><p>How could Tang Dong have other ideas at this time? He so happy that he had no time for it.</p><p>Looking at Fatty Ji, Tang Xiu then said with a smile, “I heard that you strayed from your intended role and supported him? Did such a matter really happen?”</p><p>Hastily getting up, Fatty Ji bowed and said to Tang Dong, “Tang Dong, I was in the wrong before. Gao Yanfeng gave me some benefits for me to take his side. Anyhow, I’m formally apologizing to you, and I’ll give you ten times what I got from Gao Yanfeng as a token of apology. How about it?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
