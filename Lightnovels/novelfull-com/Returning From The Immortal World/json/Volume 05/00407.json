He realized that Fatty Ji had misunderstood his meaning. He then chuckled and said, “Don’t misunderstand me. I just thought that you’re a good a person as you quoted a fair price. From here onwards, regardless of how many you have, I’m willing to buy them all. The price for each piece will be as you say, 100 thousand per piece.”</p><p>\"Really?\" Fatty Ji looked happy upon hearing it and quickly said.</p><p>“Really.” Tang Xiu said, “Though I don’t know what this ore is, I’m actually very interested in collecting all kinds of strange ores. Besides, I’m not short on money. Let alone 100 thousand or a billion, this amount is nothing more than pocket money. Hence, I’ll take however many you have in the future.”</p><p>Fatty Ji was shocked by Tang Xiu’s statement. A billion yuan was just pocket money? It was a statement only few people in the world dared to say. Yet, he also saw a golden road underneath. One must know that he just discovered this ore in a mining area he had recently mined, and hundreds of pieces of this ore had been found quickly as well. If all were sold to Tang Xiu…</p><p>Rich. I’m rich!</p><p>Fatty Ji excitedly said, “Mr. Tang, take a look at the other five ores. Do you like them too?”</p><p>Tang Xiu swept over them and found that the four could be used to craft tools and could substitute medicinal herbs and the fierce beasts’ bones in the refinement of medicines. Therefore, he picked up the four minerals and said, “I’ll take these four, too. You can directly quote the total price for them!”</p><p>Overjoyed, Fatty Ji quickly calculated in his mind and then said, “I bought these four ores through a special channel for a total price of 1.35 million yuan. If Boss Tang wants them, I’ll sell them to you for 1.5 million.”</p><p>Only taking 150 thousand in profit? It’s not much!</p><p>“Deal!” Tang Xiu nodded and said, “Give me your bank account number, I’ll transfer the money to you now.”</p><p>Fatty Ji became more delighted. He never thought that Tang Xiu would be so forthright. After giving his account number to Tang Xiu, he then quickly received 1.6 million.</p><p>“Mr. Tang, why did you give me 100 thousand more?”</p><p>“I told you that I won’t take advantage of you, didn’t I?” Tang Xiu chuckled and said, “The extra 100 thousand is for this ore.”</p><p>Fatty Ji felt impressed and subdued by Tang Xiu’s actions. He gritted his teeth and quickly said, “Mr. Tang, I still have several hundred of such ores over there. When would you want them?”</p><p>“You still have that many?” Tang Xiu was surprised.</p><p>“Yes! They were just recently mined. I believe it will be able to produce more a few more days later.” After calculating the pros and cons, Fatty Ji finally decided to tell him. He wanted to see whether Tang Xiu really wanted it, and if what he said was true, if he was really sincere in cooperating with him.</p><p>“I’ll take them!” Tang Xiu said with a smile, “After you bring them all over, you can directly hand them over to Gu Xiaoxue. She will check it personally and pay you for them. However, before buying ores from you again, we need to sign a contract. Else, I’ll no longer buy ores from you.”</p><p>“What contract?” Fatty Ji hastily asked.</p><p>“This ore you just sold me, you can only sell it to me from now on.” Tang Xiu said with a smile, “I don’t want to have this strange ore I own spread out all over the world. You also understand that the rarer the goods, the more precious and valuable they are, right?”</p><p>“I see!”</p><p>Tang Xiu’s condition for Fatty Ji was simply what he sincerely wished for!</p><p>After Fatty Ji had left, Gu Xiaoxue, who was standing by and keeping watch, spoke.</p><p>Tang Xiu casually handed it over to her, as he smiled and said, “You have good fortune. This is called Spirit Crystal, and it contains spiritual power inside. After cultivators have absorbed the spiritual power inside it, their cultivation speed will increase. Send someone to Fatty Ji’s mining area to closely watch the activity there. If he sells the harvested crystals to us, let him continue working for us and pay him. But if he dares to use his crooked mind to sell even a Spirit Crystal, kill him directly and take over his mining area.”</p><p>“Affirmative!”</p><p>Gu Xiaoxue looked pleasantly surprised. She naturally knew what a Spirit Crystal was. She had heard about it from her Master, Gu Yan’er, and from Elderly Ji Chimei.</p><p>In the Immortal World, rumor had it that there were Spirit Crystals and Immortal Crystals. Each of which was divided into many grades.</p><p>While fiddling and assessing the Spirit Crystal in her hand, she curiously asked, “What grade is this Spirit Crystal, Grand Master?”</p><p>“Its quality is of the worst grade.” Tang Xiu answered with a smile.</p><p>Upon hearing it, Gu Xiaoxue looked a bit disappointed.</p><p>“Don’t look so disappointed.” Tang Xiu chuckled and said, “Even the worst quality Spirit Crystal is already good enough for those who have yet to reach the Immortal Nascent Stage. Besides, having these Spirit Crystals is better than nothing, isn’t it? Besides, I estimate that you only need to absorb a hundred Spirit Crystals at the most before you can reach the tipping point of the Golden Core Stage. You even have a chance of stepping into the Immortal Nascent Stage!”</p><p>\"Really?\" Gu Xiaoxue was pleasantly surprised and immediately asked.</p><p>“Do I look like I’m teasing you?” Tang Xiu chuckled and said, “All right, go busy yourself! Do remember to send someone to monitor Fatty Ji and his mining area.”</p><p>“No problem!”</p><p>Gu Xiaoxue quickly gave the Spirit Crystal back to Tang Xiu and then left, looking joyful.</p><p>A few minutes afterward, Tang Xiu had returned to the exquisite pagoda. Just as he entered the first floor, he saw Light and Dark standing there. They couldn’t conceal their happiness as they knelt down in front of Tang Xiu and called out, “Paying respects to Grand Master.”</p><p>“Get up!” Tang Xiu smiled lightly and said, “Since Yan’er has decided to take you as her disciples, you must prove yourselves and make her satisfied with you. However, don’t be too proud and arrogant, you must cultivate well in the future so as not to let us down.”</p><p>\"Yes!\" Light and Dark replied in unison.</p><p>Tang Xiu waved his hand, motioning the two of them to leave. His eyes then landed on Ji Chimei as he said, “I have checked all the core members of the Everlasting Feast Hall. They are all good! You can teach them cultivation techniques. Impart them a cultivation technique that only reaches the Golden Core Stage. As for the following method after the Golden Core Stage, consider to impart it to them after they have completely reached that stage.”</p><p>“Lord, Master has also considered this issue before, yet she eventually gave up.” Ji Chimei hesitantly replied, “As a matter of fact, imparting a cultivation technique is not a difficult issue, it’s mainly due to the lack of cultivation resources. It’s fine if the number is small, since I can get them through various channels, even providing some precious medicinal herbs and concocting some pills. But if there’s too many, even I will become overwhelmingly busy!”</p><p>“I can teach you a method, actually.” Tang Xiu said with a smile.</p><p>“What is this method, Lord?” Ji Chimei asked.</p><p>“Use the incentive system.” Tang Xiu said, “You can devise a detailed reward form, such as whoever obtains precious medicinal herbs from the outside, depending on the quantity, you can then reward them some pills based on the standard. You can make this standard to be higher, however. I believe that not only will they have motivation and goals, but they will also acquire the cultivation resources as well! As for concocting pills, I’ll take some time off later to refine a batch of pills, but you have to give me the needed raw medicinal herbs.”</p><p>Ji Chimei looked excited, “This one will respectfully obey the Lord. This one will do according to your instructions.”</p><p>“I’ll tell you another good news. I just learned that there exist Spirit Crystals on Earth. I’ve handed the matter over to Xiaoxue, she’ll tell you about the specific details.”</p><p>“Spirit Crystal?” Ji Chimei then said, “Boss, if there are Spirit Crystals, not only will my injury recover quickly, but you will also be able to arrange the Nine Heavens Frost Array. Thus, once you have laid this array, we’ll be able to suppress the Twilight Nightmare effect on Master’s body so that it can support her and give her more time.”</p><p>Tang Xiu’s eyes lit up, as he nodded and said, “You’re right. Wait until a batch of Spirit Crystals is sent. You are to collect them and save them until you can lay the Nine Heavens Frost Array. After that, you can give them as resources to cultivate talents.”</p><p>“Affirmative!” Ji Chimei cupped her fists and said.</p><p>As Tang Xiu arrived at the seventh floor, he saw Gu Yan’er smiling at him. Shaking his head, Tang Xiu then smiled and said, “What are you thinking of? To think you unexpectedly have such a happy smile?”</p><p>“Master, you’re really good to me, the best.” Gu Yan’er said, “I just heard your chat with Old Ji. I never thought that Earth would have Spirit Crystals.”</p><p>Tang Xiu walked over and held her shoulders. He let her lean on his chest and whispered, “There are many things on Earth that shocked me many times already up until now. Inside my interspatial ring there is also a Holy Dragon Fruit. You should know the value of this fruit. Apart from it, I have just found a good clue about the Demonic Revival Grass, so I planned to rush to Shanghai to track its whereabouts. However, I heard news about you awakening from slumber, so I immediately changed direction.”</p><p>“Holy Dragon Fruit? And the Demonic Revival Grass?”</p><p>A shocked expression appeared on Gu Yan’er’s breathtakingly beautiful face. One must know that these items, even in the Immortal World, were topmost treasures that countless Immortals always dreamed of. Yet, little did one expect that these items would appear on Earth.</p><p>For the following two days Tang Xiu stayed in the exquisite pagoda. He chatted with Gu Yan’er, telling her various stories. Shortly put, in these two days, his ears were always full of Gu Yan’er’s happy laughter.</p><p>“Master, Yan’er can’t bear it any longer.”</p><p>On the seventh floor of the exquisite pagoda, Gu Yan’er’s lower lip trembled, her face ghastly pale. Her voice turned fainter and fainter.</p><p>Gently hugging her, Tang Xiu was full of concern, saying, “Yan’er will be fine. Don’t firmly hold it back despite the pain. Master will come here to accompany you often, and I’ll immediately rush here when you wake up. Furthermore, I’ll do everything I can to cure your injury. Have faith in Master. What your Master has said will surely be done!”</p><p>“OK!”</p><p>Gu Yan’er’s blurred eyes suddenly turned bright. Her spirit was as if it had suddenly turned better. Her soft body suddenly pressed in Tang Xiu’s arms, as her pale lips directly sealed on Tang Xiu’s lips.</p><p>One second!</p><p>Two seconds!</p><p>As the third second passed, Tang Xiu finally sobered from his panic-stricken state. As he was about to push Gu Yan’er, he noticed that her eyes were already closed, as two crystal tears slipped from the corner of her eyes, softly falling on Tang Xiu’s arms.</p><p>Table of Contents</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
