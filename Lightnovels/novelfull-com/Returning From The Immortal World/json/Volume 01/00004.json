Never would they have guessed that Su ShangWen could be this shameless, not apologising when his son was in the wrong, not having the right attitude when begging to people, and even using a higher status to threaten other people.</p><p>However, thinking back on Su ShangWen’s influence in Star City, everyone can’t help but lament in silence for Su LingYun and Tang Xiu.</p><p>Even if Su ShangWen’s character was detestable, it was an undeniable truth that he owns an asset of over a few million and the connections that he had build up over the years in Star City could make one lose hope.</p><p>Just when everyone thought that the weak-natured Su LingYun would submit to his threat, a smile suddenly surfaced from Su LingYun’s expressionless face as she lightly tiptoed, raising her hand and ruthlessly gave Su ShangWen a slapped on his face.</p><p>That slapped was so loud and clear that everyone in the living room had thought that there were problems with their hearing.</p><p>In everyone’s eyes, Su LingYun was a refined and composed, good-tempered and agreeable kind of person, to say that she had a weak character was also not disagreeable, there were only instances of her getting bullied and not once was she the one bullying other people. However for the first time in her life, she actually dared to slap someone, and the one getting slapped was even the strong and robust Su ShangWen. This caused everyone’s jaw to drop.</p><p>Seeing Su ShangWen getting slapped by his mother, Tang Xiu was feeling extremely satisfied and couldn’t resist laughing out loud, but the joy was short-lived. Tang Xiu’s body on Earth was extremely frail to begin with. The sudden returned of his soul, the overwhelming sorrow and happiness in that short period of time and coupled with the usage of the breathing technique from the Origin Ignition Art which burns away the user’s life force had cause him to faint after merely three big laughs.</p><p>When Su ShangWen realised that he was given a slapped by his younger sister who was shorter than him by a huge margin, a vicious glint flashed past his eyes as he bellowed in rage and wanted beat Su LingYun up. But never would Su ShangWen have thought that before he had the chance to take action, a pair of ice cold handcuff had landed on his hands. Cheng XueMei who was standing at the side observing the scene had already prevented him from flying into a rage and harming people.</p><p>“Me and Hu WenXu will send Tang Xiu to the hospital, Mdm Su LingYun will follow us along. The rest of you will bring the relevant people that was involved to the police station!” Cheng XueMei glared at Su ShangWen with disgust, and with a wave of her hand, she concluded the operation for today. (TLN: I assume that Hu WenXu is another police officer, the random names appearing is really quite confusing)</p><p>Su ShangWen was like a deflating rubber ball withering away in an instance as he looked at the silhouette of the departing Cheng XueMei.</p><p>Similarly, Zhang XueMei would never had guessed that the joyous celebration banquet would end in such a tragic manner due to the misdeeds of their own family. Even if they could get released easily after the arrest, but their reputation among their friends and neighbours were tarnished.</p><p>On the other hand Su YaNing and Su FeiXiang were stupefied since a while ago. They could clearly not comprehend how a simple prank could land them in such a desperate state.</p><p>“It was Tang Xiu who manipulated the whole event, he blew up the matter on purpose!” Tang Xiu’s devious smile and his words on wanting to continue playing along with Su XiangFei abruptly surfaced in his mind as Su XiangFei cried out hysterically. But sadly at this point in time, nobody would bother about the agitated Su XiangFei anymore.</p><p>Meanwhile in the Star City hospital where the night grew deeper.</p><p>The night sky was glittered with stars as a ray of moonlight shines through the glass window onto the scrawny-pale but refined face of Tang Xiu.</p><p>“With the gods in the sky, and the demons on land, the universe had determined the gods and demons to be separated. If gods are holy beings, are demons the lowly ones? If demons are superior, are gods the inferior ones? The universe is always moving, strength and weakness are hard to separate, Yin and Yang will eventually meet. When both forces gather, fusion occurs and the form of good and evil will coexist as one. This is the Dao of yin and yang……” (TLN: Yin = Dark, Yang = Light)</p><p>A string of words that was difficult to understand abruptly spilled out from Tang Xiu’s mouth which woke Su LingYun up who was resting beside his bed.</p><p>Initially, Su LingYun had thought that her son was having a nightmare due to the traumatising incident that happened in the afternoon and wanted to wake her son up. But when she saw the complexion of her son through the dimmed lights, she got rid of that thought.</p><p>Although Tang Xiu said a bunch of words that was incomprehensible, his facial expression displayed an unusual calmness and his two nice looking eyebrows were curved into a crescent-moon shape as if he was smiling lightly.</p><p>“Was my son reciting a classic?” Remembering that her son was going to be in the third grade of high school, Su LingYun felt relieved.</p><p>In the next moment, Su LingYun’s eyes suddenly opened wide.</p><p>She was astonished by the sudden burst of radiance coming from the stars outside the window which later turned into tiny bits of starlight, passing through the window and projecting onto her son’s pale face. The bits of starlight then silently assimilated into his body.</p><p>After a while, a faint layer of white mist was slowly produced and lingered around her son’s body which seem like a fantasy-like illusion in the dark night.</p><p>Seeing that her son’s pale complexion slowly turning rosy and a layer of holy light covering his forehead, Su LingYun unhurriedly reached out to that white mist with her hands, wanting to confirm that she was not hallucinating.</p><p>However the moment she touched the white mist, all of it disappeared into thin air.</p><p>“It seems that today’s incident must have given me a huge shock for me to be hallucinating.” Su LingYun smiled bitterly as she helped Tang Xiu lay his blanket properly before lying down to rest again.</p><p>What Su LingYun didn’t notice was that with the disappearance of the white mist, Tang Xiu’s eyelashes quivered lightly for a brief moment.</p><p>“The Supreme Art of Quintessential Space, I actually managed to successfully cultivate the Supreme Art of Quintessential Space?” Tang Xiu had a face filled with disbelief as he laid on bed silently feeling astonished after checking his own body condition.</p><p>The Supreme Art of Quintessential Space was a mysterious cultivation technique unintentionally recovered by Tang Xiu at an ancient remnant of the gods and demons, and this cultivation technique was passed down from the Ancient era.</p><p>It was said that during the Ancient era when heavenly energy was not formed yet, the world was filled with formless energy. The human race were like ants while the world was dominated by the god and demon race where their martial skills could move mountains and drain the seas.</p><p>The ancestors of the god race had extremely powerful insights, thus their cultivation technique were mostly on cultivating the mind. On the other hand the ancestors of the demon race had extremely powerful physique, thus their cultivation technique were mostly on cultivating the body. Although the cultivation technique of both the gods and demons were extremely powerful, but it clashes with each other mutually, making it impossible to cultivate both technique at the same time.</p><p>It was also because of the god and demon’s overly powerful cultivation technique that caused the extinction of both race, leaving behind only traces of the battlefield and fragments of secret techniques.</p><p>The Supreme Art of Quintessential Space that Tang Xiu had found was claimed to be a supreme cultivation technique that allowed both the geniuses from the god and demon race to cultivate it.</p><p>After getting the cultivation technique, Tang Xiu went frenzied with joy as he began studying the technique. However, after a 100 years he had no choice but to admit that he was unable to cultivate it.</p><p>The reason was that this cultivation technique requires the cultivator to have his physical and mental state returned back to the initial point when the cultivator was given life, which means, returning back to the state when they were just a fetus. Not only does it require the body to be in the purest form, the mind also had to be in the purest form. This was simply impossible to achieve.</p><p>Tang Xiu went into seclusion to thoroughly study the art for 100 of years, but he was still unable to find a solution to it. Out of disappointment, Tang Xiu threw the Supreme Art of Quintessential Space into his storage ring as if it was rubbish. He did not share it with his lover and close friends as he felt that it would be useless to them. Not only would it waste their time and effort, it may even result in cultivation deviation.</p><p>But it was exactly this decision that caused his lover and close friends to breed hatred in their hearts and in the end joined hands to deal with Tang Xiu, causing his soul to be shattered and dying with resentment.</p><p>“How did I managed to cultivate the Supreme Art of Quintessential Space in just one night on Earth even when I had failed cultivating it after spending 100 of years in the Immortal World? Was it because the body I had on Earth had a better cultivating aptitude than the body I had in the Immortal World?” Tang Xiu fell into contemplation.</p><p>Very soon, Tang Xiu rejected that notion.</p><p>As the grandson of the Holy Sect head in the Immortal World, he was nourished with all kinds of heavenly treasures even when he was still in his mother’s womb, and even after he was born, he was strengthen externally and internally. His intelligence and cultivation aptitude was also extremely monstrous. Not only was his cultivation progressing at a very fast pace, the amount of spiritual pills, martial skills, cultivation tools and talismans that he possessed also caused other people to be green with envy.</p><p>On the other hand, the body that Tang Xiu had on Earth was malnourish since young. Furthermore, he was so focus on his studies that he neglected on training his body. After the car accident, he became very clumsy and often hurt himself. Thus it was not logical that his body on Earth would have a better cultivation aptitude than his body in the Immortal World.</p><p>“Since the problem was not in cultivating aptitude, then what was the problem?” Tang Xiu fell into contemplation once more as he felt a thread of energy from the stars and also a weak but distinct life force coursing through his body.</p><p>The Supreme Art of Quintessential Space requires the cultivator to have his physical and mental state returned back to the initial point when the cultivator was given life, which means, returning back to the state when they were just a fetus…</p><p>It was said that during the Ancient era when heavenly energy was not formed yet, there was only formless energy.</p><p>Coincidentally, the current Earth practically do not have any heavenly energy in its environment.</p><p>As for physical and mental state……</p><p>After throwing up blood and being unconscious, my body was in a paralysed state where i couldn’t control my own body and this could barely fulfil the requirement of starting from scratch. My soul had also just returned back which caused my mental state to be untainted, so to say that it was starting from scratch was also undeniable.</p><p>After deciding to try it, Tang Xiu took a leap of faith as he recklessly charged ahead, recalling through the contents that he had painstakingly memorised for over a hundred thousand times and began on his first phase of cultivation.</p><p>The first stage of the Supreme Art of Quintessential Space, Transcendence of the Stars!</p><p>“With the gods in the sky, and the demons on land, the universe had determined the gods and demons to be separated. If gods are holy beings, are demons the lowly ones? If demons are superior, are gods the inferior ones? The universe is always moving, strength and weakness are hard to separate, Yin and Yang will eventually meet. When both forces gather, fusion occurs and the form of good and evil will coexist as one. This is the Dao of yin and yang……”</p><p>As the chant was recited line by line, Tang Xiu discovered that his consciousness started to extend out rapidly until he saw a sky full of stars.</p><p>For the first time in his life, Tang Xiu felt that the stars were rather cute and familiar, causing him to have the urge to gently caress and care for it.</p><p>With a flicker of mind, Tang Xiu’s consciousness began to reach out towards one of the star which suddenly brighten up majestically as if it was calling out for Tang Xiu. It then shattered into countless starlight before sprinkling towards Tang Xiu’s consciousness and entering his body.</p><p>When all the starlight was absorbed by Tang Xiu’s body, his consciousness started to reach out to other stars again.</p><p>Just like this, he started to play hide and seek with the stars as he gradually forgot that he was in the middle of cultivating.</p><p>“Ahhh……” Suddenly, Tang Xiu let out a scream and withdrew from his cultivation after an unknowing amount of time.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
