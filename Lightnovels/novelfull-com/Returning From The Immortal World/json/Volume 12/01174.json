But Tang Xiu’s sharp eyes directly penetrated the veil and saw her face clearly.</p><p>She was truly a belle with a soul-captivating beauty!</p><p>Such a soul-stirring beauty was not something rare for Tang Xiu to see, but he must admit that this one was slightly above the rare belles he had ever met. Her enchanting petite body completely showcased her perfect figure while her eyes rippled like a spring tide. Her smile was full of holiness and brought about a powerful magnetic enchantment, yet gave off an extremely attractive vibe.</p><p>“Hello, 72. How brazen and audacious you are.”</p><p>The sweet voice brought no bewitching effect, still, the essence of her voice made the hearts of whoever heard it throb faster.</p><p>Ki Kitagawa’s face was bitter as he helplessly replied, “Your Honor Saintess, I’m willing to return this jade cauldron to you to keep my life.”</p><p><em>The Holy Lady? As in… the Joyous Palace’s Saintess?</em></p><p>An odd look on his face, Tang Xiu suddenly felt amused inwardly. Why would the Joyous Palace have a Holy Lady while the place itself was a obscenities and debaucheries nest? And the fact that was the most unbelievable to him was that this woman was still a virgin.</p><p>The woman seemingly didn’t want to bother herself with Ki Kitagawa anymore. Her gorgeous eyes slowly shifted and fell on Tang Xiu. Her eyes suddenly lit up and she slightly raised her brows and voice. “You’re truly powerful for being able to force 72 to this situation. Sir. Miyaji has been looking for this jade cauldron for several years already and we finally found today, thanks to you.”</p><p><em>She speaks Mandarin? Has she already seen my origin?</em></p><p>Tang Xiu squinted and his eyes lingered on her. He was unperturbed by the attraction and temptation effect brought by this female since he himself was often together with beautiful women. Even if this beauty in front of him was as beautiful as the extraterrestrial devilish demon belles, he had killed too many extraterrestrial beautiful demon cultivators back then with her level of beauty.</p><p>“Um…?”</p><p>Half a minute passed by in silence and Tang Xiu’s eyes finally lit up. He found a raindrop shape red mark flashed on the glabella of this Joyous Palace’s Saintess. Although the red mark only appeared in a flash, he could keenly capture it.</p><p>“That’s a pity, really…” Tang Xiu finally shook his head and softly sighed.</p><p>The female still looked undisturbed and maintained her unique demeanor, asking, “Why did you sigh, Sir? What are you feeling pity for?”</p><p>Tang Xiu ignored her and shifted to Ki Kitagawa and smilingly asked, “I get it now. You didn’t want to give me that jade cauldron. The female furnace you told me should be this woman, right? That’s interesting, though. You seem to be loyal to the Joyous Palace, yet you want to borrow my hands to make things worse for them instead. Ki Kitagawa, or Mr. 72, am I right?”</p><p>Ki Kitagawa’s pupils shrunk. A much stronger aura suddenly burst from him and his appearance also slightly changed along with the change in his aura. His body size was nearly doubled and his seemingly ordinary appearance now turned a bit rough with a blade scar on his cheek.</p><p>“You’re Tang Xiu, the renowned young divine doctor from China, the owner of Magnificent Tang Corporation, and the outstanding scion of the famous Tang Family of Beijing? Hahaha… you’re truly outstanding. You can correctly guess my intention. Young Master Tang does look very powerful!” Ki Kitagawa gently shook his shoulder and the clothes on his body instantly shredded to pieces. Then, a new set of clothes instantly appeared on his hands as he put them on in just a few seconds.</p><p>Clad in black pants, a black vest, and a cloak, even his leather boots were black. At the same time, a sizable large broadsword appeared on his back out of thin air with two ropes that swayed as though they were alive before he finally fixed the broadsword sheathed on his back.</p><p>Tang Xiu’s expression remained unchanged as he calmly waited for the strange transformation of Ki Kitagawa’s physique to end. Then, he shook his head and sighed. “I thought I was already powerful enough. It turns out that I’m slightly weaker than you, Mr. Kitagawa. I can sense that you’re hiding something special, but I didn’t expect you to hide it so deeply. Well… how about reintroducing yourself, then?”</p><p>Ki Kitagawa stretched his neck and moved his lower body first. The cracking sounds of his bones spread out and he grinningly said, “Now, now. Are you gonna take this Joyous Palace’s Saintess or what? I’ll tell you my real identity if you take her. But if you don’t, there’s no need to know who I am and you’ll be forever staying in Japan!”</p><p>Tang Xiu raised his brows and then turned to look at the Joyous Palace Saintess, whose expression had now changed. “He’s right, though. I’m afraid you’ll have a hard time today if you come here alone this time. Still, it’s certain that I’ve been planning to remove your Joyous Palace, so I’m glad that some strangers will do the job to get rid of you.”</p><p>“Hmph…”</p><p>The Joyous Palace Saintess snorted as hazy shadows suddenly appeared from the surroundings and tens of women with white gauze skirts and veils, all of whom had Buddhist artifacts in their hands and stared daggers in a murderous manner at those in the surroundings.</p><p>“Ki Kitagawa is a traitor, but why are you taking our Joyous Palace as your enemy, cultivator from China?”</p><p>Tang Xiu shrugged and said with a pale smile, “You know, Japan may not be an outstanding place, yet it has enormous population nonetheless, and you can expect to find some good resources here. Besides, I’m rather interested in some people from Joyous Palace, to begin with. Just like… you.”</p><p>“Hmph! It turns out that you’re also a shameless man!” the Joyous Palace Saintess hummed coldly and instantly waved her arms.</p><p><em>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</em></p><p>Tens of masked females in white attire moved fast as though beautifully dancing white butterflies and formed the Buddha Vajra formation in the blink of an eye. They themselves seemed weak, but the aura that erupted from the Buddha Vajra formation was overbearing. All kinds of Buddha forms floated around them. The scene may look chaotic, yet it was very orderly done as they flew in a certain trajectory secretly.</p><p>Tang Xiu looked up to observe it for a short while and a strange smile sported on his face. Even though he had himself surrounded by this Buddha Vajra formation, he didn’t rush to act and smilingly looked at Ki Kitagawa while giving a “please” gesture. “Well, you’re someone from the Joyous Palace, so you must know a bit about this Buddhist array, right? If you wanna follow me and leave this formation alive, you gotta pay it with your name.”</p><p>“Bwahaha…”</p><p>Ki Kitagawa raucously laughed with contempt visible on his face. “You want me to follow you just relying on you, a trivial cultivator? Heh, you’re of no use to me, so why should I give a damn about you? Since the female furnace that the Joyous Palace old geezer has bred for so many years is now here, then I’ll destroy the unsightly things first, including you, the dignified Young Master Tang! Hahaha…”</p><p><em>Crack…</em></p><p><em>Crack…</em></p><p>“…”</p><p>The ground in the courtyard suddenly moved. It was not an earthquake, but many cracks appeared on the ground and directly split. Along with the cracking sounds, twelve black holes then appeared and shadows made of black smoke that depicted figures from the underworld came out of them. The tens of enchanting masked woman had not yet acted, but nearly a hundred figures had already rushed from the black hole underground.</p><p>“For tens of years I’ve been planning and for decades have I been waiting for this to happen. And today, this old man finally gets his chance. O’ soldiers of the God of Death, heed my order and take out everyone here but this Joyous Palace Saintess!” A chair suddenly appeared behind Ki Kitagawa out of the blue as he happily sat after giving a command.</p><p>The moment he saw the bizarre phenomenon on the ground, Tang Xiu tensed up and his heartbeat hiked up upon sensing the man in black night coat’s aura.</p><p>That bunch was over a hundred people, all of whom were experts at the Golden Core Stage. If they fully unleashed their power while still being unaware of Ki Kitagawa’s cultivation level, even he would be forced to retreat for the time being.</p><p><em>Buzz…</em></p><p>Suddenly, Tang Xiu felt something on his arm. He didn’t do anything but straightly disappeared from everyone’s eyes as some swords then came shooting to the spot where Tang Xiu had just disappeared.</p><p>A chilling light flashed in Ki Kitagawa’s eyes. A green net suddenly appeared in his hand as he chanted a bizarre mantra. The green net instantly opened and expanded extremely fast and covered the entire range of a kilometer in just a hundredth of a second.</p><p>Everyone around, including Tang Xiu, who also grabbed Tang An, couldn’t get out and were caught in the big net at this moment.</p><p>“What should we do, Grand Master?”</p><p>A bad premonition struck Tang An as she transmitted her voice to ask.</p><p>Although she had shielded the surrounding space, Tang Xiu was still able to see the scene in the courtyard, including everyone there. He watched as the tens of females set up the Buddha Vajra formation and were now in mortal combat with a hundred black-masked and clothed men. He shook his head and slowly said, “The situation has surpassed my expectations, and both their powers are beyond my estimation. We’ll just wait and see for now.”</p><p>Sitting on that particular chair with a leg atop the other, Ki Kitagawa slowly took out an octagonal mirror from his sleeve pocket. Each corner of the mirror was inlaid with a delicate blood-red crystal that seemed to produce a flowing red ray that connected the blood-red crystals. Red threads then extended from the crystals and condensed in the center of the mirror.</p><p>“Sky Blazing Mirror!”</p><p>Joyous Palace Saintess, who was attacking a black-clothed man’s chest with a string of Buddhist beads, still had her guard up against Ki Kitagawa. However, disbelief was all over her face when she saw him bring out that mirror. She even looked frightened upon seeing that the Sky Blazing Mirror was activated.</p><p>Ki Kitagawa let out a strange grin and said, “Well, well. You deserve to be the Joyous Palace Saintess. That fossil monk vulture must really love you, heh! To think that he even told you the existence of this Sky Blazing Mirror. That’s right. I was the one who snuck into your Joyous Palace 18 years ago and stole it while that corrupted monk had sex with Huoji. Since you already know it… then how about tasting this Sky Blazing Mirror?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
