Aside from one building, it was transformed into a wide training ground. There were only a few disciples in the main hall, but most of them were elites.</p><p>In the interior, to the north of the small bridge and a stream was a rockery, while north to the rockery was a two-story Japanese-style pavilion. Daikura Sakuragi was sitting by the window of the second floor while drinking sake and enjoying massages from two beautiful masseuses, whereas the big cigar in his hand kept producing smoke curled upward.</p><p><em>Tap, tap, tap…</em></p><p>The sound of walking steps came from the staircase as a big and stout man with a katana hanging on his waist appeared in front of Daikura, reporting. “Dojocho, we have a big client visiting.”</p><p>Daikura Sakuragi didn’t bother to even lift his eyelids and asked without being salty, “What big client?”</p><p>“He said he’s from Singapore and knows that there are many underground forces in Japan. That’s why he’s kind of worried about his safety and is here to hire some bodyguards from us,” explained the burly man. “Also, he said that money is not a problem as long as we guarantee his safety.”</p><p>“Money isn’t a problem, huh?” Sakuragi finally looked up and slowly asked lightly, “How many muscles does he want, exactly?”</p><p>“100 men,” said the burly man.</p><p>“Come again?!” Daikura’s expression changed and looked incredulous. The main hall’s business was indeed not to teach students martial arts, but rather a training department that provided bodyguards for hire to others. This place may look like a dojo, but it was better to call it a bodyguard company.</p><p>100 people?</p><p>He founded the Inada Society more than 40 years ago, but it was his first time hearing someone wanting to hire 100 bodyguards at once. It must be noted that the bodyguards for hire in this place were very expensive, yet this person wanted to hire 100 of them? Can this Big Boss afford it?</p><p>“Who’s this person?”</p><p>“He only mentioned that his surname is Tang, a scion of a wealthy businessman from Singapore.” The burly man shook his head. “His visit to Japan this time is to play around while also wanting to appreciate the customs here. On the other hand, he also wants to find a Japanese gambler to have some great games with him again.”</p><p><em>Find a gambler?</em></p><p>Sakuragi Daikura frowned and asked, “Did he mention anything about who this gambler friend of his is?”</p><p>“He didn’t mention it but said that he must have an unusual identity.” The burly man shook his head again.</p><p>Daikura was silent for half a minute. Then, he dropped the cigar into the ashtray and got up. He flicked to the two belles to grab his coat on the hanger and then said, “Anyone who can hire 100 bodyguards is sure not your everyday layman. Take me to see him.”</p><p>A few minutes after, Daikura then saw Tang Xiu, who sat in the VIP room with a leg atop the other. His gaze swept over to the two males and two females around him first as he immediately squinted his eyes and greeted with a smiling face. “You’re the one called Mr. Tang, right? Welcome to Japan!”</p><p>Tang Xiu turned towards Kuwako who had changed her appearance and asked in English, “What did he just say?”</p><p>Kuwako explained the sentence and finally said, “He’s the Dojocho or Dojo Head of the Inada Society, Daikura Sakuragi.”</p><p>Tang Xiu immediately understood and got up, saying, “It’s a pleasure to meet you, Mr. Sakuragi. Anyway, you should understand me speaking in English, right? Forgive me about it as my family has long moved to Singapore many years ago, hence the reason I only speak the language in my country, English and Mandarin.”</p><p>Daikura Sakuragi also knew that most Singaporeans were of Chinese descent, so it was not unexpected for him to hear Tang Xiu speak about it. He then nodded and replied in fluent English, “Well, English is an international language, so I naturally can speak in it a bit, Mr. Tang. Anyhow, you’re a big client here, so feel free to mention any of your requests.”</p><p>“Well, your man must have told you that I need 100 bodyguards, right?” Tang Xiu smiled and said, “Also, it’s my first time coming to your great place, so I don’t know much about it. Another thing is, I lost contact with my gambler buddy, so please help me find him.”</p><p>“Providing 100 bodyguards won’t be a problem. I’ll even give you a discount.” Daikura smilingly replied, “May I know for how long you are you hiring them, Mr. Tang? Also, I can help find your gambling companion as long as he lives in the capital.”</p><p>Tang Xiu thought about it and extended a finger. “A month.”</p><p>“And, what’s the name of your gambling companion?” asked Daikura.</p><p>“Nishi Masayoshi. Quite a public figure in the capital, I think.” Tang Xiu smilingly said, “He said he’d invite me to Japan’s capital and be his guest. I just couldn’t come before, kind of restricted by my schedule.”</p><p><em>Nishi Masayoshi?</em></p><p>An odd expression was evident on Daikura’s face. He knew who this person was, a famous gambler who frequented all the casinos in the whole of Japan and was well-known for his great gambling skills. Further, he also knew another fact about him. The man also had a travel company. He heard the company was quite big but the man himself was too lazy to manage the business and just gave it to his subordinates to handle.</p><p>“Mr. Tang, I think I can find this Nishi Masayoshi you just mentioned,” said Daikura smilingly. “If you’re not in a hurry, how about I send someone to find him now?”</p><p>Tang Xiu deliberately looked surprised. Then, he nodded and said, “That would be great, then! That’s right. Do you know a good casino? I can’t wait to have some good games with him again.”</p><p>“There’s the famous Floating Yacht, about a dozen kilometers from here. It’s well-known in the whole capital and its owner is a friend of mine too,” Daikura Sakuragi smilingly replied.</p><p>“Alright, then I’ll trouble you to guide me there, Dojocho Sakuragi.” Tang Xiu smilingly nodded.</p><p>“That’s nothing, really,” said Daikura smilingly. “Also, I’ll send someone to quickly arrange 100 bodyguards for you. How are you going to arrange them, though? Do you want to take them at once? Or assign them…”</p><p>Tang Xiu waved and intentionally displayed a silk-pants’ style and said aloud, “Of course I’m taking all of them at once. I heard rumors that Japan is not very safe and many thugs are roaming around. These men can pack them up if I happen to run into them. Besides, won’t it look imposing and stylish if I bring a group of them around, Dojocho Sakuragi?”</p><p><em>Imposing and stylish?</em></p><p>Daikura Sakuragi was left speechless secretly. He could tell at a glance that the four bodyguards guarding this guy had extraordinary skills and he’d be very safe with them around protecting him. <em>This fella is hiring so many bodyguards at once just to look stylish and imposing? He wants to play as a powerful and influential man, doesn’t he? Like the rest of those junior silk pants of the haves, he’s so f***king arrogant.</em></p><p>Naturally, he couldn’t just blurt these words out either. In any case, his place provided bodyguards for hire to make money. Being able to make a fortune like now, he didn’t want to bother himself with what kind of shits this guy wanted to do.</p><p>Quickly after, a handsome sum of money was sent to Daikura’s account.</p><p>As for the equipment and cars, everything was arranged by Daikura. Certainly, the expense was on Tang Xiu’s tab. However, Tang Xiu himself had his own reason and purpose and naturally didn’t mind it.</p><p>Half an hour later when the motorcade drove out of the Inada Society, Daikura Sakuragi received the news that Nishi Masayoshi, the fella Tang Xiu was looking for, was now having a game with some other people at this time at the Floating Yacht, so he directly told Tang Xiu about the news.</p><p>“Hahaha, truly a gambling companion this Young Master Tang admires! I just came shortly in Japan, yet he has been roaming around to make a killing already. Go go go, hurry there! My hands are itching. I can’t wait to have 300 rounds of games with him!” Tang Xiu mindlessly slapped Daikura’s thigh sitting next to him.</p><p><em>*Gasp…*</em></p><p>Despite being one of the Chess Pieces and a Buddhist cultivator of the Joyous Palace, Tang Xiu’s slap still pained Daikura Sakuragi. It was hard for Daikura to believe that the guy next to him who looked so pale and smelled like one who had spent his time excessively on wine and women turned out to have so much strength.</p><p><em>Could he be… a cultivator too?</em></p><p>The possibility crossed his mind and he immediately probed. “Mr. Tang, you’re still young but you have quite a strength yourself. Have you been practicing martial arts, by chance?”</p><p>“Me? Martial arts?” Tang Xiu looked up and then spoke with contempt, “What a joke! How can I be like those weak people? My family is a very powerful clan in Singapore and I myself have been cult…”</p><p><em>Cough, cough…</em></p><p>The one sitting in the front seat, Kuwako, intentionally coughed several times and interrupted Tang Xiu.</p><p>Tang Xiu acted like he was stunned and immediately seemed to recall something. Then, he quickly shifted the topic and yawned hastily. “Oh, well. Anyway, you know that having strength is quite great, right? Well, I know I can beat up some big brown bear myself without it knowing what hit it. Hahaha…”</p><p><em>Cult… it must be cultivation? He’s a cultivator? As expected… he’s one of our kind.</em></p><p>Daikura Saguragi’s eyes flickered. Although Tang Xiu was interrupted, he could easily guess the rest. However, he felt that even if this guy sitting next to him was also a cultivator, it was likely that he wasn’t that strong that even he himself would easily knock him out completely with a slap.</p><p><em>He’s nothing but a silk pants, nothing coming from him poses a threat.</em></p><p>Daikura originally wanted to send someone to investigate this guy. But now it looked like he didn’t need to do so at all. He could just use his own means and milk him dry.</p><p><em>I can join his gambling games with Nishi Masayoshi. I’m sure I’ll win a lot from them easily given my ability. I can get at least eight or even nine figures from them later!</em> Daikura suddenly looked forward to it after the thought crossed his mind.</p><p>Before the entrance of the Floating Yacht.</p><p>Four middle-aged men in black suits and sunglasses were standing straight with hands on their backs while coldly watching the pedestrians in the surroundings. They didn’t even glance at the passers-by.</p><p>However, when tens of cars drove slowly from the distance and stopped before the entrance, the four stalwart men exchanged glances and each wore a shocked look.</p><p>Who could this big shot be? Coming here with such a big posse? Even the most powerful Godfather in Yamaguchi prefecture wouldn’t make such commotion, right?</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
