They rushed to the remote Tomoda District with aggressiveness and savageness as though they were going to face battle.</p><p>The fight to kill was always bloody and killing frenzy was inevitable!</p><p>Tang Xiu himself was unperturbed and watched the scene calmly. Such a level of battle and slaughter was something he had experienced countless times already. He even had his share of being involved in the frenzy battlefield millions of times. Tang An, who stood next to him, and the newly arrived Mo Awu’s group, however, looked shocked.</p><p>“Isn’t this way too frantic and frenzied, Sect Master? This is my first time as an observer in a battle of this scale,” Xue Sha said with a solemn face.</p><p>“The environment you’ve been living is way too comfortable, so you got shocked by this minor battle. Which reminds me, it would be bad for you. Seems like I gotta arrange some huge battle scenes later. It will make you realize yourself well after you’ve experienced it.”</p><p>“…”</p><p>Mo Awu and Xue Sha shrunk. They didn’t like fighting and killing if it wasn’t necessary, let alone the battle that involved several thousand combatants. It was already crazy enough for them. They couldn’t imagine what kind of scene would it be if the scale was much bigger than this.</p><p>Tang Xiu’s brows suddenly raised and he said, “Well, today’s truly getting lively, though. Little did I think a small place like Japan had so many hidden experts. That makes me realize how happy the average people in China are.”</p><p>“Huh? Why do you say that, Sect Master?” Mo Awu blurted with a confused face.</p><p>“The number of cultivators in China is probably more than the number of people you’re seeing here now. The number may even be several times more. But how many people are there in China and how big China’s territory is? Don’t you see how the average people there actually live happy, prosperous, and comfortable lives? What about Japan? Its area is much smaller, yet it has such a large number of practitioners as well as genetic warriors. What about the average Japanese, then? Won’t they be oppressed and having a hard time to have such a happy life and peaceful work like those of their Chinese counterparts?”</p><p>“To the best of my knowledge, Japan’s economic development is very high, yet is aimed at a certain group of society. While it has a small territory and a large population, the disparity between the haves and the poor is like a chasm. The rich live in those spotless high-rise buildings, whereas the poor can only nest in their ‘coffin room’ or ‘family motel’. Some even have to live in internet cafes. Kyoto, for instance, is a bustling major city with many immigrants. Yet they live in a few square meters room, squeezing themselves within a crowded and tiny place.” Mo Awu commented.</p><p>Tang Xiu looked at him with approval. “That makes Japan like an inhuman place where humans will devour their own kind. However, that’s also the chief cause for such abnormal social deformities, especially the sex industry as you can see here, which I suspect is the work of the Joyous Palace’s people.”</p><p><em>Whoosh…</em></p><p>A hazy figure flickered from the distance. It was Kuwako, who bolted fast to arrive before Tang Xiu and spoke with a beaming face. “The men I’ve planted all over Kyoto just reported the emergence of practitioners literally everywhere. They are highly suspected to be Joyous Palace’s members, and all of them are now moving over here. I suspect it’s related to the flute Joyous Palace Saintess just played.”</p><p>Tang Xiu wore a weird expression and replied, “Why do I feel like our operation is going too smoothly? We did give some leads to a certain Japan’s state agency, yet they just proactively kill each other without us having to get involved in the battle? Doesn’t that mean my move of sending Miao Wentang to inform the Buddhist Sect is unnecessary, then?”</p><p>At a certain spot in the distance, Ki Kitagawa and tens of his remaining men were still engaged in the battle and encircled Joyous Palace Saintess, as well as preventing those genetic warriors from killing her, while the fearsomely powerful Yin Buddha and his two confidantes kept slaughtering the genetic warriors without holding back.</p><p>However, as would ants die for sweets, they kept swarming forward.</p><p>This bunch of genetic warriors simply had lost their fear of death and fought with everything they had for a chance to kill or wound Yin Buddha, Yang Yi, and Yang Er. That was the main reason the trio was quickly scarred by wounds in just a little over 10 minutes.</p><p>“You both protect the Saintess and escape!”</p><p>Yin Buddha sent six genetic warriors to their deaths and appeared next to the Saintess quickly as he shouted to his two subordinates.</p><p>In but a moment, both Yang Yi and Yang Er rushed to Joyous Palace Saintess’s side. Wounds could be seen decorating their bodies, but they still kept killing these genetic warriors crazily.</p><p>That was literally blazing their path out with a bloody road.</p><p>The group of four frantically carved their way out with intense struggle for a few kilometers. Right as they were at the end of the rope, the Joyous Palace’s people finally arrived. This first batch was small in number, only about a dozen, but it was enough to lift their spirits.</p><p>“DIE!”</p><p>The killing intent in Ki Kitagawa’s heart was multiplied by several folds upon noticing the arrival of the Joyous Palace’s members. He had been preserving his power when fighting Yin Buddha but this time, he finally made up his mind to kill the monk and his two subordinates without much delay and snatch the Joyous Palace Saintess.</p><p>Striking in nearly a sneak attack fashion, the long blade cut off Yang Yi’s hands. The blade then moved in a bizarre trajectory and ripped open the man’s abdomen. Yang Yi’s internal organs would have burst out and fallen had the wound been a bit deeper.</p><p><em>Puff, puff, puff…</em></p><p>Three genetic warriors stormed over to the badly wounded Yang Yi, two of whom even held Yang Yi’s arms when the man grabbed the neck of the third one, even several other genetic warriors accurately seized the chance and pierced him with their weapons.</p><p>“YANG YI!!!”</p><p>Yang Er roared and was about to split up. He angrily slashed down tens of genetic soldiers and rushed to Yang Yi lightning-fast. He quickly made a secret technique seal that doubled his strength directly after seeing Yang Yi’s miserable state and frantically strangled several genetic warriors to death before grabbing Yang Yi.</p><p>“Kill… Kill… and ru…n.”</p><p>Yang Yi spurted out a mouthful of blood and directly died after leaving those words weakly.</p><p>“I’M GONNA KILL YOU ALL!!!”</p><p>Yang Er put down his body and went berserk as he stormed over to the crowd of genetic warriors around with fierce blows. But after killing a little over 20 people, the black-suited men with Golden Core cultivation level had him surrounded and trapped. At this moment, a thin weak figure suddenly emerged out of the blue in the midst of the crowd and his sharp katana pierced Yang Er’s neck through the back.</p><p>“Farewell, Uncle Yang.”</p><p>The figure was a 10-year-old looking boy as he naughtily winked his eyes at Yang Er.</p><p>Disbelief was all over Yang Er’s face. He knew who this boy was. The little guy had been playing the role of Ki Kitagawa’s son. Never did he expect that the little boy who he thought didn’t have any chance to even pose a threat, now turned into his executioner.</p><p>Time fleeted by. Thousands of souls were lost in the battle and the number of Joyous Palace’s members kept increasing, resulting in the increasing number of trophies for the genetic warriors. After Ki Kitagawa and his men were successful in killing Yang Yi and Yang Er, the man was finally able to deliver heavy blows to Joyous Palace Saintess and took her away from the battlefield.</p><p>“You know, people change as day that change into rain is.” Ki Kitagawa muttered while watching the scene of the battlefield.</p><p>Joyous Palace Saintess coughed up a mouthful of blood and yelled angrily, “You are crystal clear on what kind of fate will you end up for betraying the Joyous Palace, Ki Kitagawa! Regardless of what your true identity is, you have been a member of Joyous Palace and even a Chess Piece. Just wait! You will face endless and heartless pursuit in the days that follow. Only death awaits you even if you run to the ends of the earth!”</p><p>” <em>Heh</em> , no one knows whether the Joyous Palace can still exist until that day!” Ki Kitagawa sneered. “You’re talking about the restriction your Miyaji cast on me, ain’t ya? Be disappointed, lady. I also got the secret technique to remove it back when I stole the Blazing Sky Mirror.”</p><p>“You really have it?” Joyous Palace Saintess looked horrified and rapidly asked.</p><p>The man just gave her sneer in response. He didn’t reply and just waited still. At this time, the Joyous Palace disciples were gradually gaining ground, and the genetic warrior’s casualties were increasing fast.</p><p>“Seems like you’ll finally end up the loser, Ki Kitagawa!”</p><p>The man watched her with a bizarre expression and said with a faint smile, “Haven’t you noticed something yet? Why don’t I look the least bit scared even in this situation, huh?”</p><p>The answer made Joyous Palace Saintess stared blankly as a bad feeling filled her heart.</p><p>“It’s about time. You know, the number of Joyous Palace members in Kyoto should be no more than 500. And 400 of them are here. Well, let me satisfy your curiosity then. I’ll tell you the greatest card I’ve been relying on.”</p><p>Having said that, he streaked up into the sky. Overlooking the fighting crowd below, he shouted, “Hey, time’s almost up! What else are you waiting for?”</p><p>The thundering voice directly pierced straight into the clouds in the sky.</p><p>At this moment, the scene of fighting changed. More than a hundred people from the Joyous Palace who had been fighting with the genetic warriors suddenly turned their weapons to their own side, catching their former comrades unaware and finally impaling them with cold blades.</p><p>“WHY?!”</p><p>With total disbelief on their faces, numerous badly wounded members of Joyous Palace furiously hissed at their former comrades who attacked them.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
