His principle was that it was up to the person himself to choose whether to believe or not. A chance may be lost since one opted not to believe. Hence, Fan Gang only had himself to blame for not taking it.</p><p>On the third floor of the Fast Leisure and Relaxation Motel, the spacious and brightly lit general manager’s office was already spotless and no longer full of smoke. It was thanks to the relentless efforts of the janitor and cleaning staff that the office was so clean and neat.</p><p>The sofa and tea table in the middle of the office had been moved to the corner and replaced by a rectangular dining table with four leather chairs. The fragrant dishes and two bottles of God’s Nectar had been served on the table along with a brand-new tea set, where the lingering fragrant steam of tea came out of the teapot and teacups.</p><p>“Please take a seat, gentlemen.”</p><p>Fan Gang pulled the chair himself and gestured for Wolf Head to sit first. Although he was very puzzled as to why Wolf Head was willing to work under Tang Xiu with such a personality, it was hard for him to show respect for Tang Xiu even if this young man was the current Boss of his former captain.</p><p>Wolf Head slightly shook head and pulled the chair for Tang Xiu. After Tang Xiu took a seat, only then did he sit next to him. He then looked at Fan Gang, who was sitting at the opposite side with a frowning face, and started speaking, “Gang, your brother did not visit you for so many years because I had my own reasons. I hope you can forgive me. But you’re always my brother, no matter it was then in the army or now in society.”</p><p>“I understand.” Fan Gang nodded heavily.</p><p>“Reminiscing about the old days is just one reason I’m here today. There’s also something else. My Boss wants to know something about you. But before that, I want you to take every word my Boss says to you seriously, including what he said before that he can heal your leg.”</p><p>Fan Gang shot Tang Xiu a strange gaze and forced a wry smile. “It’s not that I don’t believe in Boss Tang, Cap’. It’s just my leg… you also know about my injury. No one but those celestial immortals who can regrow my leg.”</p><p>“As I said, just trust my Boss,” said Wolf Head in a heavy voice.</p><p>“This…”</p><p>Fan Gang felt even more helpless, but he still nodded even though he didn’t buy it even a bit.</p><p>Tang Xiu patted Wolf Head’s shoulder and said with a faint smile, “I can understand your careful thinking, Wolf Head. If he’s willing to let me try it, then I’ll heal him. But let’s save talking about this since we still need to visit many other places later. Let’s go straight to business now.”</p><p>Wolf Head nodded in response. Then, he looked at Fan Gang and said, “Gang, my Boss came to this city in person since he wants to comprehend the situation in the He Province from you, be it the government, business circles, and the underground forces. You’re from the Fan Family, so you should be very clear about it.”</p><p>“Ehh?” Fan Gang was confused and asked, “Why do you ask about those things, though?”</p><p>“Gang, I can only tell you as your brother that my Boss has his own reasons. It’s confidential, so we can’t tell anyone for the time being,” said Wolf Head. “It’s like what we did back then. Don’t ask what we shouldn’t ask, for it will cause you big troubles otherwise.”</p><p>Fan Gang furrowed his brows yet again. Although he felt a bit lost since he could tell that his brother had somewhat changed, he didn’t show it on his face and only looked at his brother and slowly said, “The structure of power in He Province is rather complicated, more so with its relational network. Some people have direct access to those at the top, while some families have deep heritage and background, as well as some important officials and politicians backed by some power outside the region. Shortly put, it’s very difficult to explain it clearly. I may be very updated on any news and quite familiar with the situation in Zheng City, but I don’t think I can completely understand the situation in the whole province.”</p><p>“What do you think about your own Fan Family? Can you say that your power is ranked in the top five in this He Province?” asked Tang Xiu.</p><p>“Top five?” A strange expression was cast on Fan Gang’s face as he replied with a dry smile, “Don’t mention the top five, being listed in the top 20 is already great for us.”</p><p>A disappointed look flashed in Tang Xiu’s eyes. “Then, tell me the top five families in He Province according to what you know.”</p><p>Fan Gang mulled it over for a while before shaking his head. “I can’t say my judgment about the top five is accurate, but I can say for sure for the top three. The first family in He Province is the Zhus. They have many juniors and ancient martial arts experts. You can expect to run into one of their offspring be it in the business or politics. You may even find some of them in the surrounding provinces. That’s why I can say the Zhus deserve to be ranked first in He Province.</p><p>“They Yelus are next in the second place. They are from Xin City and are very prominent and big with the most powerful man in that city hailing from this family. The most recent skyscraper edifice there is also theirs, and this family also has numerous other industries under their flag, which became their terrifying money-making machine.</p><p>“As for the Floating Snow Chateau, I have no idea about its Master, as this person is unknown to the public. But Xue Mengdie, the vice landlord, owns more than 70% of the entertainment venues and transportation industry in He Province, all of which is under Floating Snow Chateau. They also own the largest security company in the province. Rumors have it that each police chief in every city in He Province, from the provincial capital down to the county towns, is inextricably linked with the Floating Snow Chateau.</p><p>“I have no idea how deep these three parties are, but I’m sure they all have their own armed forces with ancient martial arts experts in their ranks.”</p><p>Tang Xiu’s eyes flickering and he was full of thoughts while Fan Gang spoke. He didn’t pay much attention to Zhus and Yelus, the first and second in rank, but the Floating Snow Chateau somehow piqued his curiosity since there were many uncertain factors in Fan Gang’s explanation.</p><p>Further, he could even tell that there was something more than met the eye about the Floating Snow Chateau. If it didn’t have any affiliation with other powers, he could use this Floating Snow Chateau to work for him. More so that he also wanted to know who its Master was.</p><p>Tang Xiu lit a cigarette and then slowly asked, “Do you know where this Floating Snow Chateau is located?”</p><p>“Lianying County,” answered Fan Gang.</p><p>“You mean this Floating Snow Chateau is also located in the scope of Zheng City?” asked Tang Xiu in surprise. “Are they all locals like the Zhus?”</p><p>“That’s right.” Fan Gang nodded.</p><p>“People said that two tigers can’t share the same mountain, yet they are both rooted in Zheng City and can also develop themselves at the same time.” Tang Xiu squinted his eyes and commented. “This situation seems a bit interesting to me. Fan Gang, do you think the Zhus know the exact details about the Floating Snow Chateau?”</p><p>“They should know a lot about them, even if not thorough. But what they know must be a lot more than mine,” answered Fan Gang seriously. “The Zhus are very strong and also have some frictions with the Floating Snow Chateau. But both sides sustained heavy blows due to the clash 10 years ago. It was said that the Master of Floating Snow Chateau came out afterward and the Zhus have never made things difficult for the Floating Snow Chateau ever since. But I have no idea what exactly happened then.”</p><p>“Do you know the current Patriarch of the Zhus?” asked Tang Xiu.</p><p>“It’s Zhu Xinghe,” answered Fan Gang.</p><p>Tang Xiu got up and patted Wolf Head’s shoulder. Then, he lightly smiled and said, “It’s not easy for you brothers to get together, right? Have some drinks! There’s something I gotta do. We’ll stay here tonight.”</p><p>“Understood!” Wolf Head understood what Tang Xiu was going to do and nodded without speaking much.</p><p>Fan Gang retracted back his gaze from the door where Tang Xiu just disappeared. After four-plus minutes, he looked at Wolf Head and forced a smile. “I never thought you’d really become someone’s bodyguard, Cap’.”</p><p>“Nope. I’m not a bodyguard.” Wolf Head shook his head.</p><p>Fan Gang frowned and asked, “What, then?”</p><p>Wolf Head was silent for a while, then he said, “I’m different from you. I’m an orphan since childhood and I entered the army in my teens. I became used to the hail of bullets and living through fire and water, risking my life all the way. Only by following him can I return to my former life.”</p><p>“What did you say?” Fan Gang abruptly got up and incredulously exclaimed, “You work for him because you can go back to the battlefield and brave dangers again? Isn’t he just the Big Boss of the Magnificent Tang Corporation and a Chinese medicine practitioner?”</p><p>Wolf Head waved and gestured him to sit again. Then, he continued, “Gang, don’t even try to inquire anything about him if you’re not going to return to your former life. But there’s one thing I can tell you. His power and his terrifying side are not something you can imagine.”</p><p>“Just tell me something, Cap’. Is what he does right or wrong?” asked Fan Gang in a deep voice.</p><p>“Just!” Wolf Head categorically answered.</p><p>Fan Gang felt at ease secretly. He knew his captain wouldn’t lie to him. Then, he fell into his own train of thoughts for several seconds. Afterward, he spoke, “I want to join you, Cap’.”</p><p>“If so, you gotta keep in mind that you must be ready to die at any time.” Wolf Head shook his head and said, “Now, let me ask you something. Have you married after retiring from the special force? Do you have wife and kids and also parents you need to look after? And lastly, can you leave and cast away your present identity and status?”</p><p>“About that…”</p><p>Fan Gang hesitated for a while and then replied with a bitter face, “It’s been a long time already. I still have my abilities, but it cannot be compared to what I used to be. But what I’m talking about is the mentality, Cap’.”</p><p>Wolf Head let out a smile. “If you can’t let those go, then live a good life. As an old brother, I’ll send you a huge gift should I have the chance in the future.”</p><p>“A big gift?” Fan Gang was confused and asked, “What is it?”</p><p>“If you’re willing to part with your child, I can assure that your kid will be more brilliant and more successful than you’ve ever been.”</p><p>“You mean… giving you my son to train?” Fan Gang stared blankly before he asked in surprise.</p><p>Wolf Head silently nodded and then explained, “I can’t help you as of now since my status is too low. You can say that I’ll end up miserable in the future if I make Boss upset. But once I… as long as you’re really willing, your son can definitely have meteoric success. His achievements may not earn eternal glory, but he can at least be nurtured much better than you. Certainly, if he becomes that outstanding… he can… well, your House Fan will also be glorious and thriving in the future because of him.”</p><p>Fan Gang looked hesitant for a long while. But he finally said bitterly, “I know that I want it, but my wife…”</p><p>Wolf Head sighed and shook his head. “Well, just take it that I didn’t say anything.” Suddenly, he seemed to recall something and spoke again, “Gang, my Boss can really heal your leg. But keep in mind to cast away your doubts and skeptical attitude because there’s nothing in this world he can’t do. Wait for him to come back, then ask him to heal your leg.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
