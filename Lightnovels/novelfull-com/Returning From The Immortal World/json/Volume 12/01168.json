The casino staff then acted as attester, whereas each party sent one person to supervise each side before the four men finally separated.</p><p>The one-hundred-dollar chips were just trivial for them, but these men didn’t bother about it as those who frequented such places were not some green rookies and had their own unique abilities in gambling.</p><p>Half an hour passed by.</p><p>Tang Xiu’s expression was ugly as he sat in front of a machine. He lost 97 dollars’ worth of chips in just half an hour and only had 3 dollars’ worth left in his hand. Each one of the three people following him wore strange smiles as though they would see him lose completely.</p><p>“WOW! That’s amazing!”</p><p>A burst of cheers came from the crowd nearby.</p><p>Tang Xiu turned around and saw that the cheers came from the crowd surrounding Daikura Sakuragi. The man looked smug and proud and gestured his subordinate to take a big pile of chips into his tray.</p><p>“Lucky dogshit.”</p><p>Tang Xiu resentfully cursed and shifted back to the machine before him. He directly threw the remaining 3 dollars chips into one of the jackpot positions without hesitation, then hit the start button with his fist.</p><p><em>Cling, cling…</em></p><p>Many people around him thought that he had given up upon seeing the flashing lights from the screen. But the moment his last 3 dollars were gone, the picture on the screens finally stopped in the grand slam position.</p><p>“One… one hundred times?”</p><p>Tens of onlookers around Tang Xiu looked incredulous instantly. Never did they expect that this guy in front would actually hit the jackpot, and it was even the 100 times multiplier.</p><p>“That’s really a pity! He only has 3 dollars left.”</p><p>“Yea, he bet too little for that one. Even if he does hit the 100 times jackpot, it only earns him 300 dollars.”</p><p>“He’s as good as lost already. I just came over from the other three. The one with fewest chips is Saburo Koizumi, but he still has 20 grand chips in total.”</p><p>“Crap, forget him. Let’s not watch him anymore. He’s already lost.”</p><p>“Go, go, go. Let’s leave…”</p><p>“…”</p><p>Quickly after, only five people were left around Tang Xiu.</p><p>Instead of taking these 300 dollars chips, Tang Xiu threw all the chips that just fell out of the machine into the grand slam slot again and then hit the button under the watchful eyes of the five people.</p><p>“Impossible! How can he hit the jackpot again?”</p><p>“Is this machine broken or something? This is ridiculous.”</p><p>“What’s going on? Is it possible to hit the fucking jackpot in a row?”</p><p>“…”</p><p>The five people’s eyes almost stared with eyes nearly popped out. They were unable to take back their eyes, seeing the chips fall down from the machine.</p><p>“Beautiful.”</p><p>An excited look on his face, Tang Xiu shouted to Kuwako aloud, “Hey, what the hell are you staring for? Hurry up and put the chips on the tray, will you? This Young Master got 30 grand now. Let’s go somewhere else and change the machine.”</p><p>Time fleeted by. An hour and a half passed in the blink of an eye.</p><p>Saburo Koizumi had always won more than he lost, but today he was hit with a series of bad luck. He had been in winning streak for the first few games, but he was then struck with successive losses afterward until he lost all his winning chips and the original one-hundred-dollars’ worth of chips.</p><p>It was suffocating!</p><p>He was so distressed that he nearly burst into tears. He would have run away already if it weren’t for those big men watching him in the surroundings.</p><p>Certainly, that was 100 million dollars. He may have about a billion dollars if he added all his assets into the count, yet he didn’t expect to lose 100 million dollars in this big stake games.</p><p>Eyes blurry and hazy, he looked at Tang Xiu and Daikura Sakuragi who were surrounded by many people in the distance, whereas Nishi Masayoshi was screaming in joy. He clenched his fists tightly.</p><p>The final half an hour finally came.</p><p>Tang Xiu won more and lost less and quickly, a pile of more than 100,000 dollars already filled the tray on Kuwako’s hands.</p><p>“TIME’S UP!”</p><p>A voice from the loudspeaker in the gambling hall resounded. Tang Xiu, Saburo Koizumi, Daikura Sakuragi, and Nishi Masayoshi quickly came to the chips exchange counter.</p><p>“That was cool! I got more than 100 grand with just 100 dollars. This Young Master is definitely the victor today!” Tang Xiu smugly said aloud, showing off a silk-pants flamboyant attitude. At least, Saburo Koizumi, who stood not far from him, wanted to punch his nose so much due to that.</p><p>Nishi Masayoshi, on the other hand, hooked his finger to the man behind him and smilingly said, “Well, you just won 100 grand in the whole 2 hours, Bro Tang? That’s quite a sum indeed.”</p><p>Having said that, he motioned his subordinate to give the chips in the tray to the staff at the chips exchange counter. The final count was 3.62 million USD.</p><p>Tang Xiu’s smile was frozen as he smashed the chips in his hand to the floor and rudely spat on the carpet.</p><p>“Count mine!”</p><p>Daikura Sakuragi handed the tray to the counter staff. After the count, he won a total of 2.964 million dollars in the entire 2 hours.</p><p>As the general manager of this casino, Shiro Takeda acted as the attester and witness of the games. But he didn’t expect the final winner to be Nishi Masayoshi. His eyes swept over at the surrounding, seeing the envy on the onlookers’ faces. Then, under their hundreds of watchful eyes, he loudly announced, “The final winner is Nishi Masayoshi! And according to the rules agreed on by the players, everyone else must hand over 100 million dollars to him!”</p><p>“Hey, Manager Takeda! Your casino can’t possibly help him win, can it?” Tang Xiu loudly questioned inquisitively. “I got amazing gambling skills myself. Even the God of Gamblers in Las Vegas says that I’m gonna be more powerful later on. How the hell can I lose here? Even to him, Nishi Masayoshi, huh?”</p><p>Shiro Takeda’s complexion changed and he immediately retorted back angrily. “Please do not question the fairness of my casino, Mr. Tang. All the scenes when the four of you were gambling have all been recorded by the monitors in the casino. You can check the surveillance video if you want to question it.”</p><p>“Bleh, checking my ass! I just can’t afford to lose to this guy. It’s nothing but 100 million dollars. I’ll just give it to him.” Tang Xiu intentionally talked back with anger, but he was quite happy inwardly. The chief reason why Nishi Masayoshi could win was thanks to Tang An who had been lurking around him while being invisible and helping him cheat. She sometimes went so far as to pull some tricks on Daikura Sakuragi and Saburo Koizumi.</p><p>Meanwhile, it felt quite painful to Daikura since 100 million dollars was way too high a price for him to pay. Yet, there was no way out of this debt as there were literally thousands of eyes staring at him. He had no choice but to transfer the money to Nishi’s account. Saburo Koizumi also transferred the money and quickly left unwillingly with a foul mood.</p><p>Tang Xiu himself only looked furious at first, but his expression then changed into indifference soon after. He then spoke to Daikura Sakuragi, “Hey, are you still playing? Why did you come here if you don’t wanna play? Besides, I won 50 million dollars from this Nishi bastard in Las Vegas before, but well, he actually won 100 million from me now. That gives me a foul mood. I gotta get back on him and gamble more.”</p><p>Daikura didn’t reply, but the indignant expression in his eyes betrayed him.</p><p>As for Nishi Masayoshi himself, he smugly spoke with a smile, “Well, you’re not the kind who can’t afford to lose, Bro Tang. Besides, it’s just 100 million dollars. It’s like a drop in the bucket for a tycoon like you! Anyhow, I’ll accompany you one more time if you still wanna have a go. But let’s make a deal first. No matter who wins or loses, everything ends with the games, and the winner will have to treat the others and find them some hot chicks.”</p><p>“Fine with me.” Tang Xiu raised his chin and replied with a thick competing intent.</p><p>“So, what would be our next games, then?” asked Nishi Masayoshi.</p><p>“A card game. Each draws a card, and whoever has the biggest card wins. The bet is still 100 million dollars. How about it?” asked Tang Xiu.</p><p>“No problem.” Nishi Masayoshi curtly agreed with a strange smile.</p><p>Daikura, standing aside, heard that Tang Xiu and Nishi Masayoshi decided to pick a card game as the next game. He suddenly interjected. “Count me in. I’ll accompany you both.”</p><p>Tang Xiu was stunned. Then, he quickly sobered up and patted the man’s shoulder. He raised his thumbs up and praised. “You’re a great and amazing guy, Mr. Sakuragi. You got balls, I admire that. Regardless of whoever wins or loses, you’re a buddy of mine later on just like this good buddy of mine, Nishi Masayoshi.”</p><p>An ugly smile appeared on Daikura Sakuragi’s face. He simply dismissed the notion of becoming Tang Xiu’s good buddy.</p><p>The dealer shuffled the cards and cut it. Shortly after, one card was sent to each player.</p><p>Daikura himself was a powerful Buddhist cultivator and pulled some tricks when the dealer was dealing the cards. He exchanged the biggest cards to fall into his hands, and yet, he didn’t notice that Tang Xiu also performed a technique secretively right after he pulled the trick.</p><p>“Hahaha, you really can’t stop it when luck comes! I got an ace of hearts.” Nishi Masayoshi was the first to lift the card and suddenly burst into laughter after seeing the first card he got.</p><p>Tang Xiu also picked up his, and it was 10 of Spades.</p><p>At this time, Daikura Sakuragi looked smug and satisfied. He opened the card without even seeing it and smilingly said, “Sorry, mine is the biggest King of Spades. You both lost.”</p><p>The onlookers gathered around wore strange expressions as their eyes fell on the card, whereas the rest of the gamblers in the distance looked at the projection on the big screen. The card in front everyone was the King of Hearts.</p><p><em>What’s going on?</em></p><p>Keenly realizing something strange on the faces of everyone else in the surroundings, Daikura Sakuragi looked down to see his card, only to stare in disbelief instantly and exclaim, “Impossible, my card was definitely the King of Spades. How can it become…”</p><p>“Goddammit…”</p><p>Tang Xiu interrupted Daikura’s roar with a sullen face.</p><p>As for Nishi Masayoshi, he was as if not seeing Daikura Sakuragi’s shocked expression as well as Tang Xiu’s indignance. With a beaming smile full of excitement, he said aloud, “You bet, so you gotta be prepared to lose. No big deal. You both lost, so transfer the money quickly.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
