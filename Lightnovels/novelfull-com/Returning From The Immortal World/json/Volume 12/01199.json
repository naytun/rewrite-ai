He would have done it himself even if she didn’t. Everything Kitagawa had done hardly showed anything, but he kept showing himself as a wolf cub that wasn’t worth to raise up for he would bite his own Master one day.</p><p>Yuji’s maids trembled after witnessing how Kitagawa was executed in such a cold-blooded fashion, whereas Jun Yuchu was literately slashed into two halves by a sword beam just as he ran for tens of meters. They knelt toward Kuwako in shivers and cried out, “Master!”</p><p>“I’m not your Master, so don’t call me that,” said Kuwako indifferently. “As long as you manage well to accomplish the missions I’ll give you later, I can recommend you to be formal disciples of the sect. Your status at that time may be no different from your previous Master, Yuji.”</p><p>These several females fell into silence.</p><p>A status no worse than Yuji’s? Isn’t this equal to an opportunity—a chance to rise up from the bottom to a high position?</p><p>Tang Xiu glanced at the reticent Yuji before he immediately moved to make more than 20 circles with a meter diameter in the square. Then, he slowly said, “All of you! Sit cross-legged in the circle I just drew and circulate your energy according to your cultivation technique. Do keep in mind that how much benefits you can obtain from this good fortune will depend on yourself. However, there’s another thing you must remember. If you sense that your system can’t absorb or contain any more energy, you’re to immediately stop cultivating and leave this square at once!”</p><p>“Understood!”</p><p>All of them had no idea what good fortune Tang Xiu just mentioned could be. But they knew that it would be beneficial to them.</p><p>“Activate!”</p><p>Standing on the concrete platform set as the eye of the entire array, Tang Xiu controlled the array after activating it. The world’s spiritual energy in all directions instantly began to flood into the square where more than 20 people were sitting cross-legged. The enormous flood of spiritual energy even drilled out from the underground and poured into everyone’s body.</p><p>“What’s this?”</p><p>“Oh my God! Such an enormous amount of spiritual energy?!”</p><p>“Spiritual energy is filling up my system?! I’m not dreaming, am I?”</p><p>“…”</p><p>Regardless if it was Mo Awu’s group or the tens of females in white, everyone’s eyes opened wide with disbelief at this moment.</p><p>Tang Xiu’s brows furrowed and he shouted in a deep voice, “Focus your mind and cast away any distracting thoughts! Quickly refine the spiritual energy entering your system!”</p><p>In that instant, more than 20 people abruptly sobered up and entered cultivation in succession.</p><p>Standing on the concrete platform, Tang Xiu could sense two types of spiritual energy drilling into his system from his feet. He directed the huge spiritual energy from the Earth’s vein into that empty cosmic space within him.</p><p>As time passed, the first planet grew bigger, while the second began to grow. Even the third one started to show more luster and showed signs of getting enlarged as well.</p><p>At the same time, in a vast starfield in the distant universe with countless lifeforms, countless celestial bodies were slightly quaking. Multicolored lights burst out from these celestial bodies and suddenly made that part of the universe look a fairytale-like world.</p><p>“Who has done this?”</p><p>“Which expert is disrupting the law of natural order in this world?”</p><p>“…”</p><p>Super experts in that starfield rushed out of their planets and floated in outer space to send out their tidal wave-like spiritual senses in all directions.</p><p>However, they could only sense the life force of these celestial bodies passing through but were neither able to determine the cause nor its destination.</p><p>In the blue sky, layers of clouds were dispersing and spreading out when a column of energy with golden luster descended directly above Tang Xiu’s head. The enormous star energy seemed to nearly materialize, causing the formation array to contain a huge amount of star force within. It made Mo Awu and the rest, who were currently absorbing the world’s energy and refining it, to absorb the surging star energy around them directly into their systems.</p><p>The absorption began to start making changes in their bodies—a type of qualitative transformation through their genes.</p><p>The star force itself was the most massive and highest quality energy in the universe that the world’s energy or usually called Heaven and Earth’s spiritual energy was countless times inferior to it. After absorbing this star energy, the True Essence and Buddhist force in their system were now faintly coated with a layer of golden light.</p><p>The next day.</p><p>More than a dozen of those females in white had their cultivation skyrocket and each cultivation level now could be compared to the experts at the late-stage of Foundation Establishment. However, they were no longer able to endure the huge spiritual power from the Earth anymore. They quickly stopped their cultivation and left the square fast.</p><p>Two days later, Mo Awu, Tang Guang, and the rest got up in succession, unable to withstand the infusion of spiritual power and quickly left the square to stabilize their cultivation base after the recent breakthrough.</p><p>Thus, only Tang Xiu, Tang An, and Gong Wan’er were still sitting cross-legged in cultivation in the square now.</p><p>Disbelief and frustration glittered in Mo Awu’s eyes when he saw Tang An and Gong Wan’er there. Although he had successfully broken through and now reached the Nascent Soul Stage, he was crystal clear that the longer he stayed in the square, the more he could absorb the energy of the stars and the world, and thus, the greater chance for the breakthrough later.</p><p>Tang An entered cultivation path about a decade earlier than him and it was understandable that she could stay there for a long time. But Gong Wan’er was much weaker and at best only comparable to the experts at the mid-stage of Golden Core. How could she still endure staying in the square while enduring the pressure of such enormous spiritual energy?</p><p>“I notice something interesting here,” said Tang Guang all of a sudden.</p><p>Mo Awu turned to him, looked at his handsome face with a frown, and then asked, “What is it?”</p><p>“I just realized I can keep reaping beneficial things just being by Grand Master’s side,” said Tang Guang earnestly. “Whether it is the opportunity to render merits, or the speed of improvement in cultivation. Just like this time. He literally has made us break though collectively by using a heaven-defying means. I’ve reached the mid-stage of Nascent Soul now. I could have directly broken through to the late-stage if my state of mind and physique can still keep up.”</p><p>“You broke through to the mid-stage of Nascent Soul, not the early stage?” blurted Mo Awu in surprise.</p><p>“Yup,” confirmed Tang Guang.</p><p>Mo Awu turned to Xue Sha and He Xiong and asked, “What about you two? Which stage you’re at now?”</p><p>“Nascent Soul early stage.”</p><p>Both men shot an envious look at Tang Guang and replied at the same time.</p><p>“It seems to me having stepped into the cultivation path several years earlier does give a more solid foundation than what we have.” Mo Awu sighed, seemingly reaching a balanced state of mind now. “Just look at Tang An, she still keeps going. I wonder if she would also reach the first-stage of Nascent Soul when she leaves the square, though?”</p><p>The smile on Tang Guang’s face solidified. But then he shook his head helplessly and sighed. “Well, I can’t even match her either in talent for cultivation or going through the hardship in training. I may feel a bit of shame if she breaks through the late-stage of Nascent Soul, but I’m sincerely happy for her.”</p><p>“I just take it for granted in regards to Elder Tang An being able to absorb spiritual energy and stay much longer in the square, though,” said Kuwako slowly. “But how can Gong Wan’er persist for so long? She should’ve left the square earlier than us given her strength!”</p><p>“It should be her particular situation or condition, I think,” said Tang Guang. “My guess is that it was the main reason why Grand Master made her submit.”</p><p>“Kitagawa did mention that she has a special physique,” said Kuwako. “But Tang An went against Sect Master’s command and saved her from the battlefield then. I’m sure she has another purpose in mind, though.”</p><p>Half a day passed and Tang An finally awakened from her cultivation. Her gaze landed on Tang Xiu first with admiration on her face. But when she saw Gong Wan’er still sitting cross-legged tens of meters away from her, she immediately looked startled and her figure suddenly flickered and disappeared from the spot to appear at the edge of the square.</p><p>“Do you know what’s up with Gong Wan’er?” asked Tang An the instant she came out.</p><p>Tang Guang shrugged and shook his head. “Who knows? She has been staying there in cultivation for nearly three days and never came out until now.”</p><p>Tang An wore a strange expression and, with some thoughts filling her mind, said in a deep voice, “Do you know why I got punished by Grand Master the other day?”</p><p>“You saved her, that’s why,” answered Tang Guang directly.</p><p>“But do you know why I went against Grand Master’s command and risked my life to save her?” asked Tang An again.</p><p>“No. Why?” Tang Guang was confused.</p><p>The rest were also looking at Tang An, waiting for her reply with a curious look.</p><p>“We all know that Grand Master has been rapidly progressing in his cultivation and is now much stronger than us.” Tang An said, “But he needs to be more formidable than the current him if we want to go to that place earlier. Gong Wan’er’s physique is different than that of common cultivators like us. Dragon Vanquisher Sage, that Joyous Palace Master, fostered and trained her to be a woman furnace then, so he could devour and absorb the power in her body and make it his own to increase his power greatly. I’ve been thinking about it for a while. What if it was Grand Master who took her body? His cultivation will progress by leaps and bounds, right?”</p><p>Instantly, everyone looked pensive. They all knew about Gong Wan’er’s physique. If Tang Xiu could really gain such enormous benefits from her, that would be a great boon that would be enormously beneficial to him and the Tang Sect as a whole.</p><p>“But Grand Master abhorred the idea, didn’t he?” asked Tang Guang slowly.</p><p>“He didn’t agree, indeed.” Tang An nodded. “I even got scolded by him the moment I mentioned it. But I’m gonna tell Master about this when I get to Nine Dragons Island. I’ll see what Master has to say.”</p><p>“No way! Don’t do that!” Tang Guang’s expression instantly changed and his eyes especially turned fierce.</p><p>“I know what you’re thinking, Guang.” Tang An stubbornly said, “I also know what Master has been thinking as well. But Gong Wan’er has something greatly beneficial for Grand Master. I think Master will have a similar thought as mine when facing such a choice.”</p><p>Tang Guang was reticent for a short while but still shook his head. “An, if it was someone else, I might not stop you, but you mustn’t tell this stuff to Master! In case…”</p><p>“I don’t care,” cut Tang An in a deep voice. “In order to make Grand Master more powerful, I’ll take any punishment from him, even if it’s 10,000 times more severe than before.”</p><p>Tang Guang hurriedly said, “Don’t you like…”</p><p>“SHUT UP!”</p><p>Tang An angrily yelled and immediately disappeared.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
