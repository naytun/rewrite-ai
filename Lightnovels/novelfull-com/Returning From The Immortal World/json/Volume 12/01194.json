He turned as though a phantom and demonic-like monk who just crawled out of hell. While beating the small drum he took out, he blasted the sound wave energy that rapidly erupted in all directions.</p><p>The space in the sky wherein the spear shadows were lingering around was distorted as numerous rampaging violent gales struck, greatly reducing General Fukuda’s striking power.</p><p>“KILL!”</p><p>The sage spat out a Buddhist Golden Sarira and shot it at General Fukuda’s chest. The Sarira cracked and its luster turned dim right as it hit General Fukuda, but the latter coughed up a blood mist and was sent flying backward.</p><p>However, Dragon Vanquisher Sage himself paid a heavy price at this moment. The overlapping spear shadows may have been rapidly dissipated, but some of them managed to hit him. Along with the scattering blood mist, the monk turned into a fully bloodied figurine.</p><p>“EXPLODE!”</p><p>The snare drum in his had instantly chased General Fukuda and exploded a few meters away from him. The world felt like it was going to collapse due to the fearsome explosion wave while the enormous energy vortex smashed General Fukuda into pieces.</p><p><em>Puah… cough, cough…</em></p><p>Dragon Vanquisher Sage himself was sent flying backward more than 100 meters and slammed into the mountain wall. Instantly, several experts on par with Golden Core Stage experts quickly appeared around him, one of whom took out a porcelain bottle and took out a miraculous pill and stuffed it into the sage’s mouth. Finally, the monk’s chaotic aura gradually calmed down.</p><p>“Keep killing them! Be sure to exterminate everyone from the Gene Camp!” Dragon Vanquisher Sage coughed up two mouthfuls of blood again and ordered with dim eyes.</p><p>“Understood!”</p><p>Only a few of the Joyous Palace experts stayed with the monk as the rest were rushed toward the genetic warriors in the surroundings.</p><p>Slaughter then commenced.</p><p>Amid the killings, the Joyous Palace members kept shouting “General Fukuda is dead” and the course of the battle turned into a one-sided massacre. Less than 800 people remaining from the Gene Camp desperately fought back and attempted to flee. However, the Joyous Palace experts were much stronger and faster than many of them, causing the Gene Camp’s genetic warriors to lose their morale, resulting in the faster speed of their own extermination and the deaths of several hundreds of them in just a few minutes.</p><p>“Use Thunderstorm!”</p><p>Suddenly, a genetic warrior halted his pace with a decisive look on his face. He instantly tore his coat and grabbed a fist-sized black metal ball from his waist.</p><p>“Thunderstorm.”</p><p>“Thunderstorm.”</p><p>“Thunderstorm.”</p><p>“…”</p><p>A total of 18 people halted and shouted fiercely as each took the same fist-sized black metal balls and then stormed over towards the Joyous Palace experts.</p><p>A series of powerful blasts instantly engulfed everything 100 meters around them. Using their lives to pay for the actions, these 18 people resorted to using the Gene Camp’s lethal killing weapon and were successful in bringing down more than 100 people from Joyous Palace to be buried with them. Only those who were at least at the Golden Core Stage level were barely able to save their own lives, but with very severe injuries.</p><p>At the summit, Tang Xiu dashed from under the remaining half of the pine tree which was previously a dozen meters tall. Even the remaining trunk had also been torn.</p><p>“It’s time.”</p><p>He instantly unleashed the divine sword which bolted away and killed all the Joyous Palace members in the tens of meters radius instantly. While releasing an enormous amount Primal Chaos energy, he instantly activated the jades he installed around the pine tree as the crux of the array. Along with the injection of his Primal Chaos energy, the array he had set up and covered more than a 10km radius was now fully activated.</p><p>“Heavenly Coil—activate!”</p><p>His figure then vanished from many people’s eyes, but the rest of them, be them from the Joyous Palace or the Gene Camp, could sense the changes in the flow of energy at the moment.</p><p>Halfway up the mountain, Dragon Mountain Sage’s expression enormously changed all of a sudden. He could sense the changes in the energy flow of the world in the surroundings. Despite being seriously injured, he abruptly jumped up and shouted, “All the disciples of Joyous Palace, heed my order! Stop chasing the enemy and immediately move to my position!”</p><p>“What?!”</p><p>All the members of Joyous Palace in the radius of several kilometers shifted their sight to Dragon Vanquisher Sage’s position with an incredulous look. Never once they ever thought that the Palace Master would issue such an order when they were about to completely decimate the Gene Camp.</p><p><em>WHY?</em></p><p>The big question mark popped out in their mind. After the fast communication with their comrades in the surroundings, they finally chose to obey the command and passed the order to the rest of them around, and then quickly dashed toward Dragon Vanquisher Sage’s position.</p><p>Many genetic warriors immediately felt relieved upon noticing that their powerful enemies from Joyous Palace were no longer pursuing them. They no longer wanted to stay on the battlefield anymore now that General Fukuda had died. Saving their own lives was the most correct choice at this time for them.</p><p><em>BANG, BANG, BANG…</em></p><p>Just as they were about to dash to the foot of the mountain, they suddenly slammed into a layer of energy shield. The energy shield’s overlapping layers rippled as they hit it, thoroughly shaking them to the core. It was such a bizarre situation they had never encountered since they never knew the existence of arrays, to begin with.</p><p>Back to the halfway up the mountain, Yukiji’s eyes glanced at the surrounding with a shocked face. Then, she quickly ran toward Dragon Vanquisher Sage and quickly reported. “Someone must have arranged a huge array here and we’re now trapped within it, Miyaji!”</p><p>The sage’s face was extremely solemn as he nodded. “That’s right, someone has arranged this array even before we’ve arrived here. But I’m sure the person who set this up is absolutely not General Fukuda or anyone else from the Gene Camp. That geezer is now dead and nobody among those genetic warriors has this ability.”</p><p>“Then who could it be, Miyaji?” Yukiji asked hurriedly. “Our only enemy is the Gene Camp.”</p><p>Dragon Vanquisher Sage tried hard to force himself to calm down. A series of suspicions then crossed his mind and he kept rejecting each suspicion one after another.</p><p>Suddenly, he turned to glance around and shouted aloud, “Where’s Yuji?”</p><p>Yukiji shook her head and said, “I didn’t see her anymore since the battle began, Miyaji. You…”</p><p>The sage fiercely said, “I previously gave an order to catch that Yamamoto Matriarch, Kuwako. Who took the mission first? Was it Yuji?”</p><p>“That’s right. She took it first.” Yukiji nodded. “But then we were engaged in skirmishes with the Gene Camp, so we cast this issue aside. I… damn. I remember what those people said before they fled. They said the backer behind Kuwako Yamamoto is some cultivator from China. Could it be that the one who set up this array here is a Chinese cultivator?”</p><p><em>PA…</em></p><p>Dragon Vanquisher Sage slapped her hard, causing her to draw back staggeringly for several meters. He then dashed to her instantly and grabbed her clothes, shouting, “Why the hell didn’t you report it to me when those Chinese cultivators appeared here?!”</p><p>Yukiji covered her check and hurriedly said, “I thought they were just nobodies, so there was no need to report it to you, Miyaji. Besides, the enemy we were facing then was the Gene Camp, so I intended to delay the report to give a lesson to Kuwako Yamamoto and the people behind her to you. I thought it was better done after we’ve rooted out General Fukuda and his Gene Camp.”</p><p>“IDIOT!!!”</p><p>Dragon Vanquisher Sage hurled a curse at her. The others had no idea how powerful Chinese cultivators were, but he was well aware of it inside out. If he were to compare which side was more powerful between the Buddhist and Daoist schools, he would, without hesitation, choose the latter as the more powerful one.</p><p>Why would he say that? It was because there was only one Buddhist Sect in China, whereas there was more than one Daoist school. Not to mention the the rest from those clans and some loose cultivators. The number was just too many to count.</p><p>“Amitabha…”</p><p>A large bell-like voice came from afar and 18 figures flickered and moved lightning-fast and quickly appeared in front of the Joyous Palace members.</p><p>Dragon Venerable Sage’s pupils shrunk with disbelief. His Joyous Palace disciples were also Buddhist cultivators, but they would never utter that particular word! With the several top executives of Joyous Palace around him, the sage finally appeared in front of the 18 Eminent Monks of the Buddhist Sect, but his lips couldn’t help but twitch a few times and some fear even appeared on his face.</p><p><em>Blackface Buddha and Jade Buddha?!</em></p><p>He was familiar with these 18 people in front and remembered each and every one of them clearly. These 18 people were born in the same era as him and they used to be rivals. Never did it occur to him that he would run into all 18 of them in Japan, of all places.</p><p>Blackface Buddha grabbed his staff and coldly stared daggers at Dragon Vanquisher Sage, saying, “This poor monk was rather shocked and felt strange the moment I heard the Joyous Sect reemerged in Japan. I first thought who could that powerful figure be that escaped the previous purge. I didn’t expect that you’re not dead yet, Dragon Vanquisher. You even still indulge yourself in mundane desires and meddle in everything in Japan. No matter what, this monk must kill you to cleanse the Buddhist Sect from undesired elements today.”</p><p>Dragon Vanquisher Sage paced half a step backward and indignantly yelled, “You killed 9 Martial Brothers and 4 Uncle Masters of mine before and you made me struggle for life for months due to serious injuries you gave me, Blackface Buddha. Is that punishment still not enough for you?”</p><p>“The cultivation art you’ve been practicing was originally tolerable as it was only to follow the steps the unrestrained Joyous Buddha so you can have a partner for pair cultivation. Yet, your Joyous Sect went ashtray and committed shameful deeds left and right in order to make yourselves stronger. You even went so far to rob and ravish women and fell from grace due to your own evil deeds. Because of you, our Buddhist Sect became notorious and has been living in seclusion in the deep mountains with little contact with the outside world, reluctant and not daring to publicize our Buddhism teaching. This sin and disgrace must be washed up clean with the blood of all you. And today, you and everyone from the Joyous Palace must die for you must pay the deeply grievous price!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
