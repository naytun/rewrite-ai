He could sense that these people were very strong from their auras, particularly the person who just spoke and the woman next to him.</p><p><em>Soul Bewitchment Scent?</em></p><p>The faint scent from that female’s body made Tang Xiu slightly surprised as it was similar to Soul Bewitching Scent used by the ravishers in the Immortal World. Despite being some distance away from her, he still could smell the scent with his sharp chemoreceptors.</p><p>Meanwhile, Kuwako translated Osashi Kitagashi’s words in English.</p><p>“Northstar One Blade Style, huh?” A ridiculing expression filled Tang Xiu’s eyes as he spoke in fluent English indifferently. “I’m already clear about how much power the Northstar One Blade School can offer, particularly the Five Elements Ninjutsu, which is a really powerful technique. Yet, it’s still nothing but trash compared to cultivators’ cultivation art as it was very hard for people who practice it to reach your level. You’re asking who we are? Why don’t you introduce yourself first?”</p><p>Osashi frowned and turned to look at Yuji beside him. Then, he shook his head and replied, “Showcase your strength first if you wanna know who we are. The weak have no qualification to learn it.”</p><p>“Is that so?”</p><p>Tang Xiu clapped and then remained silent.</p><p><em>Puff…</em></p><p>A dumpy middle-aged man standing in the rightmost line of the ten men and women behind Osashi Kitagishi suddenly had a drastic change in expression. His pupils shrunk as his left arm was quickly cut off. It was caused by a sword that seemed to have its own intelligence that appeared out of the blue and instantly vanished the instant after. Only the flying mutilated arm and the splattering blood proved the instant attack a moment ago.</p><p>“Aaaaargh…”</p><p>The short and stout man screamed while instantly covering his shoulder with his thick palm. He circulated the energy in his body frantically to quickly stop the bleeding.</p><p>Panic and horror were evident on the faces of the rest as they immediately glanced at the surrounding vigilantly for fear that they would fall victim to that bizarre strike as well. Even the strongest among them, Osashi Kitagishi and Yuji, were no exception.</p><p>“Well, is that guy who just got his arm cut off also an expert?” asked Tang Xiu with a faint smile.</p><p>Despite feeling tense and restless inside, Osashi coldly replied, “Of course he’s an expert.”</p><p>“He’s an expert, yet I can cut off his arm. Does this prove that we’re qualified to know your origin?” asked Tang Xiu.</p><p>Osashi Kitagishi and Yuji exchanged looks, then the latter slowly said, “You do have some strength to boast since you’re able to injure my subordinate severely in the blink of an eye, though it was just a sneak attack. Have your excellency ever heard about the Joyous Palace?”</p><p>Instead of answering her, Tang Xiu glanced at the rest.</p><p>Everyone shook their heads, but after some time, Kuwako spoke in a low voice, “I think I’ve heard about it. I only know that it’s the most mysterious sect and power in Japan. Their shadows can be seen literally everywhere, be it in the army, politics, and business.”</p><p>Tang Xiu gave a curt nod in response and shifted to Osashi, saying, “Well, I suddenly don’t feel like bothering to know to what sect you belong to anymore. Besides, those who take me as an adversary only have one end—death. Today’s matter will only end with all of you dead!”</p><p>Kuwako’s eyes shone. She immediately took out an object from her sleeve pocket and threw it into the sky, immediately followed by an explosion.</p><p>“KILL!”</p><p>She had been forced to hide in the manor to preserve her life and had been holding back her foul mood for a long time. After releasing the signal, she was the first to rush forward to attack Osashi Kitagishi. Behind her, Tang Guang, Hei Xiong, and Xue Sha instantly followed, including Mo Awu, who hadn’t joined the fray yet.</p><p>Tang Xiu himself didn’t hurry to move and just watched the tense-looking Yuji retreat for tens of meters in an instant as she appeared on the roof of the building behind her. After she stared back at him, he hooked his finger and sneered. “Aren’t you the most powerful person here? Come and fight me rather than hiding like a turtle!”</p><p>Yuji couldn’t sense Tang Xiu’s strength, but she didn’t take this man lightly and shouted fiercely, “Four Vajra Guardians, KILL THAT BRAT!”</p><p>Suddenly, four stalwart big men appeared in front of Tang Xiu in the blink of an eye. After laying out the Vajra Fist Array and activated it, they let out grim grins and looked at Tang Xiu as though he was a lamb ready to bet butchered.</p><p>“A Buddhist type array?”</p><p>Tang Xiu looked a bit offbeat. <em>These four men are obviously that woman’s followers. From the scent of that woman from their bodies, it’s certain they just had some pleasure time not long ago. And yet, how come this woman has the Soul Bewitchment Scent as well as seemingly having a deep origin with some Buddhist school?</em></p><p><em>A Buddhist sect… a woman… pleasure and joy… and Joyous Palace?</em></p><p>The subsequent interlinked series of clues quickly made Tang Xiu realize that these people were from a splinter group of Tantric Buddhist, the Joyous Sect. Yet, it never occurred to him that these Joyous Sect people could actually become the most mysterious and powerful force in Japan.</p><p><em>It’s no wonder these Japanese men and women bunch are so open in their relationship!</em></p><p>While letting out an odd smile, Tang Xiu directly greeted their attacks with a barrage of punches. Afterimages of his punches moved lightning-fast with a punching speed at least twice faster than the four of them, delivering hundreds of punches in just a few breaths.</p><p>“Aaargh….”</p><p>“Aaargh…”</p><p>“…”</p><p>“…”</p><p>Four shrill screams came from the four men who arranged the Vajra Fist Array. Their fists and muscles turned into flesh pulp as every inch of their bones was crushed and their muscles twisted.</p><p>The scene somehow made Tang Xiu shake his head with a slightly regretful face. He instantly released a divine sword and slashed the four’s necks. Columns of blood burst upward as their big heads were thrown away, creating a mist of blood.</p><p>Yuji, who stood atop the roof, nearly had her eyes jumped out. Outsiders may not know the strength of her four loyal men, but she was crystal clear about it as she was the one who used secret methods and a large amount of resources to train them. Each one of them was even stronger than some of the Buddha’s warrior attendants. They could blast a solid iron ball the size of a head with their punch.</p><p>And yet… these four men who arranged the Vajra Fist Array for her turned to end up so miserable just by the barrage of this man’s fist even though they were aided by the array that made their physiques and power stronger?</p><p>Such a great loss was really distressing. The pain suffocated Yuji like thousands of blades shearing her heart. She had paid a huge prince, only to witness the final result where they were just killed like that by this man.</p><p>“I’M GONNA KILL YOU!!!”</p><p>An enormous pressuring aura burst out from her body as her figure stormed forward toward Tang Xiu lightning-fast. Everyone else who was being engaged in fights in the surroundings couldn’t help but retreat to avoid the enormous pressure.</p><p>Tang Xiu’s eyes lit up and he moved his wrist to unleash the Starquake divine ability. The sword in his hand swayed in the air and overlapping layers of sword beams instantly passed through Yuji.</p><p>“This is IMPOSSIBLE!!”</p><p>Yuji’s figure turned stiff and came to a halt. She looked incredulously at her chest, belly, legs and the bleeding holes on her shoulders. With her cultivation that was on par with Nascent Soul experts, she could clearly sense the loss of life force from her body.</p><p>Tang Xiu didn’t stop and instantly retracted the divine sword back into his body and moved his finger extremely fast to seal tens of Yuji’s acupoints, prohibiting her Buddhist Golden Core Sarira from flying out and alleviating the loss of her life force. He completely made her lack the strength to even move and posed no more threat.</p><p>“STOP!”</p><p>Tang Xiu shouted aloud while seizing her neck.</p><p>In that instant, everyone stopped moving, some of whom were Yuji’s subordinate who particularly looked incredulous.</p><p>At the moment when all the enemies were stunned, however, Tang Xiu’s left hand quickly moved. Suddenly, Osashi’s neck was bleeding and a sword pierced his heart. Tang An appeared in but an instant and manipulated her immortal sword to kill an expert next to Osashi Kitagishi.</p><p>Mo Awu and the rest also moved to attack boldly at this moment. In a fashion almost like sneak attacks, they killed or heavily injured the enemies nearby. Any slight mistake in the fight between experts would cost their lives. Tang Xiu’s unusual trick was ingenious, clever and ruthless.</p><p>10 minutes later, all the enemies in Shaofang’s venue were either killed or captured. Those who attempted to fight back were also stopped by Kuwako’s subordinates, but after several of them were down, Mo Awu’s group finally moved to kill the remaining enemies.</p><p>Further, those from the Northstar One Blade school who were not from Kuwako’s faction were all killed. But those who killed them were the people under Kuwako. In a sudden fashion, the crisis had been completely lifted.</p><p>Inside Shaofang’s building.</p><p>Tang Xiu casually threw Yuji to the floor, sat on the chair opposite her and said, “Take care of Osashi Kitagishi first. Give him some healing pills if he’s losing life force too fast.”</p><p>“Understood!”</p><p>Mo Awu respectfully replied and strode out of the room.</p><p>Tang Xiu’s focus shifted to Yuji and asked in fluent English, “Those wounds won’t kill you. I have the means to save and even spare your miserable life. But I want you to cooperate well. I guarantee you can live if you do so.”</p><p>With a pale face without any spirit, Yuji shook her head and said, “I can tell what you want to ask me. Pity I can never tell you even if I’m dead.”</p><p>“You know, the most dreadful and terrible thing in the world is not death itself, but rather being kept conscious in the border of life and death where you wish to die but is unable to do so,” said Tang Xiu indifferently. “I can make you wish to die yet are unable to have it and live in endless pain for one, ten, or even one hundred years. Certainly, I also give you the chance to have a good life as well. It’s your call.”</p><p>A dread appeared on Yuji’s eyes as she fell into silence for a long while. Then, she broke the ice and slowly said, “You can never stop me if I’m dead-set to die, anyway.”</p><p>Tang Xiu took off the bronze mask on his face and sneered. “I’m from China and someone who’s honored as a Divine Doctor there. Further, I’m also a cultivator. I have countless ways to keep your life while being tormented constantly. That’s something easy for me.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
