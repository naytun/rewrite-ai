However, Tang Xiu’s convincing act as silk pants who showcased his never-on-short-of-money side had fully enticed Daikura Sakuragi to eventually fall into a trap and lose 200 million dollars for nothing.</p><p>Such a loss was definitely a tremendous blow for the man. Yet, he must keep his promise as he was under the watchful of thousands of onlookers, else his reputation would go down the drain and become a notorious shameful man in the eyes of many people.</p><p>However, seeing how smug, excited, and proud Nishi Masayoshi was at this time, the urge to kill him inevitably erupted inside him. He secretly made up his mind to act by himself and separate this guy’s head from his body when the commotion passed by after some time. He would snatch back all his losses today and completely rob him of everything.</p><p>“There are things I still need to tend to, Mr. Tang. Farewell.”</p><p>Daikura looked pale and extremely indignant-looking and coldly dropped the statement before turning around and leaving.</p><p>Tang Xiu didn’t pay any heed to him and just transferred the stake money to Nishi Masayoshi’s account, saying with an upset face, “Alright, spare me all the bullshit and stop being a jerk. This Young Master is not in the mood to play with women today. Don’t bother. I’ll find myself a place to rest and I’ll take you on some other games after resting.”</p><p>“Well, no worries about that, Buddy!” Nishi Masayoshi hurriedly replied, “Let’s leave together if you wanna play no more. Besides, you haven’t found a good place to stay in Japan, right? Don’t go to a hotel, my villa in Kyoto is available for you. Or do you want me to find a bunch of belles and join me to have a look at them.”</p><p>“Bah, what a show-off.” Tang Xiu glared at him snappily. He directly stretched his hand out and said, “Just gimme the address and the key. You can go wherever, but don’t bother me today. Wait until tomorrow to show me the chicks.”</p><p>Nishi Masayoshi wasn’t angry. He swiftly took out a door card and gave it to Tang Xiu. “The address is on it, you can go straight there. That’s right, do you want me to give you 100 bucks for the cab?”</p><p>“I’ll break your nose if you dare spit out such shitty fart again!” Tang Xiu angrily replied.</p><p>With that said, he quickly left the Floating Yacht along with Kuwako and the rest. After sitting in the car, his mobile phone rang and he quickly asked, “Did he go back?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“Keep monitoring him.”</p><p>“Understood.”</p><p>As he hung up, a smile appeared after he changed his appearance. He just won 300 million dollars so easily and dug a pit for Daikura Sakuragi. The operation was so smooth that it was beyond his expectation.</p><p>“The money has just been transferred to the usual account at the Swiss Bank, Sect Master. Additionally, we’ve also fully arranged the getaway route for Nishi Masayoshi. Nobody will notice his departure from Japan tonight, and it’s impossible for Daikura Sakuragi to find Nishi’s trace anymore given his abilities.” Kuwako reported to Tang Xiu respectfully after having similarly answered a call.</p><p>“I see.” Tang Xiu nodded with a light smile and then asked, “What about the next operation? Have you prepped it already?”</p><p>“It’s all been prepped.” Kuwako nodded. “Also, Yuji is guessing that Ozawa Manzo should also be someone from the Joyous Palace. I think we can carry out the next plan more smoothly.”</p><p>****</p><p>At Donjimen, Shinjuku.</p><p>A very famous department store in Kyoto was located here, a building with tens of floors filled with a superb collection of dazzling merchandise of great value. At this time, a well-known businessman in Kyoto, Ozawa Manzo, was seen walking while hugging the waist of a seductive slender woman. They were now on the 16th floor that was mainly for the gold and silver jewelry stores.</p><p>“Honey, this three-carat diamond is really beautiful. Take a look at its engraving style and luster. I love it so much. I even heard that celebrity, Ryoko Kitagawa, wore this type of diamond ring when she married Director Kawada.” The gorgeous woman’s eye lit up as she fondled the diamond ring in her hand. Her sweet voice was as though able to wake up a dead man from his grave.</p><p>Ozawa Manzo raised his brows without much interest and said, “Buy it if you like it! If Ryoko Kitagawa’s man can afford it, so can I. Ah, I think that platinum necklace in the next display cabinet is great. I’ll buy it for you, too.”</p><p>“Thanks, honey.” The glamorous woman kissed him, the ripples in her foxlike eyes as though water.</p><p>“Hold up!”</p><p>Kuwako Yamamoto, who had already changed her appearance, strode with her high heels and a long red dress. She gently stroked the hair on her forehead and spoke without being salty, “I love this diamond ring, too. Why don’t you give it to me?”</p><p>The seductive woman’s expression changed and she angrily asked, “Who are you? Don’t you know the meaning of ‘first come first served’?”</p><p>Kuwako rolled her eyes at her and shouted to Tang Xiu behind her, who just entered the store, “Dear, do you see this diamond ring? It’s beautiful and I’ve long been loving it ever since I saw it. Can you buy it for me?”</p><p>Tang Xiu’s face went black and he indignantly said, “Buy, buy, and buy. You only know to keep buying stuff, don’t you? Don’t you already know I’ve just lost tons of money?”</p><p>Having reproached her, he directly shot Ozawa Manzo and the pretty woman a look and threateningly said, “Scram! My woman wants this ring. Nobody can snatch it from her, else I’ll kill you.”</p><p>A cold light flashed in Ozawa’s eyes. He paced a step forward towards Tang Xiu and sneered. “And who the hell are you, Mister? You actually dare to snatch things from Ozawa Manzo? Are you tired of living or what?”</p><p>Tang Xiu stared daggers at him and thundered. “What fucking shit is Ozawa Manzo, huh? I’m snatching your things? Do you want me to smack you up or what?”</p><p>Ozawa was enraged. He was always the one bullying others, not the other way around. He pushed the pretty woman holding him and moved to give Tang Xiu a lesson. Just as he paced two steps forward, however, he slightly knitted his brows upon seeing tens of sturdy men rushing in through the store entrance.</p><p><em>This brat is not some average layman.</em></p><p>Being a cautious man, Ozawa retracted back his gaze and coldly asked, “Who are you? Trying to get in the way and coming here with so many men? Are you doing it on purpose to give me a lesson, huh?”</p><p>Tang Xiu rolled his eyes at him and mocked. “Who the shit do you think you’re? Me, making trouble on purpose? I told you to scram already, else I’ll beat you up so hard that even your mom won’t recognize you.”</p><p>“Bastard!”</p><p>Ozawa rushed towards Tang Xiu and appeared in front of him in just the blink of an eye. His fist moved extremely fast and directly hit Tang Xiu’s chest. The punch could have severely injured Tang Xiu if he was an average person. Unfortunately, Tang Xiu wasn’t any average person and he didn’t feel any pain in the slightest.</p><p>Yet, Tang Xiu still followed his role and acted accordingly. He staggered four steps backward and even forced himself to cough up some blood after stumbling on the floor.</p><p>Kuwako intentionally screamed out in panic, “Honey, a-are you… are you okay? Hey, what the hell are you staring for? That guy hit the person you must protect. Are you still bodyguards or what? Take him on!”</p><p>Tens of bodyguards immediately stormed over towards Ozawa Manzo. They were all martial artists and, though not very strong, each of them was enough to deal with more than ten average people.</p><p><em>BAM, BAM, BAM…</em></p><p>A wave of punches hitting human flesh was heard. Yet, instead of them beating up Ozawa, it was the latter who sent them flying in just a few seconds.</p><p>Sitting straight with Kuwako’s support, Tang Xiu observed Ozawa’s attacking method. He could tell at a glance that the man was definitely a cultivator with a rather remarkable strength as well. The man didn’t even use all his strength when punching the bodyguards a moment ago.</p><p>“Hey, all of you outside? Are you dead or something? Get your ass here and kill this bastard!” Tang Xiu raised his arm and screamed out with trembling fingers.</p><p>At that instant, a large swarm of bodyguards flushed in from the outside and more than 80 people jam-packed inside, filling nearly half of the store’s space. As these bodyguards saw Tang Xiu’s wretched appearance and their comrades’ miserable state, they immediately swarmed over, with most of them pulling out weapons.</p><p>“Damn! It’s a trap.”</p><p>Upon seeing the scene before him, Ozawa instantly realized that this wasn’t just a simple conflict but a trap against him. The purpose was not to teach him… but rather to kill him.</p><p><em>If so… then I must kill some of them as a warning for the rest!</em></p><p>A chilling light filled his eyes as he instantly pulled out a sharp dagger from his waist. The dagger moved about up and down and two bodyguards at the forefront had their throats slashed and hearts stabbed.</p><p>“Murder… he’s killing people!!!”</p><p>Acting like a weak woman, Kuwako instantly screamed out when she saw that two bodyguards were killed. After her voice faded away, however, another strong man was hit and flew backward, whereas the staffers in the jewelry shop panicked and ran away, one of whom pressed the alarm button and contacted the police.</p><p>The martial artists trained by the Inada Society were a bunch of ruthless people. They may be bodyguards now, but murder and arson were normal things they had done in the past. Now that their companions were killed, it aroused their own savageness, many of whom took their pistols and trained its dark muzzles at Ozawa Manzo.</p><p><em>Puff, puff, puff…</em></p><p>A figure flickered and moved lightning-fast in the midst of these bodyguards. Those who had pulled their pistols had their wrists slashed. But Ozawa didn’t resort to killings this time and just kept delivering heavy blows and severely injured these bodyguards. It took only half a minute for him to send almost 50 bodyguards flying with severe injuries.</p><p>Supported by Kuwako, Tang Xiu crawled up from the floor while covering his chest. He intentionally wore a frightened look upon seeing Ozawa’s great power display. He called out loudly, “Damn Japan and that bastard Daikura Sakuragi! Didn’t he vow his Inada Society’s bodyguards were a bunch of experts? Yet, they are nothing but trash. SOMEONE HELP, MURDER!!!”</p><p>While attacking the bodyguards in black suite, a chilling light overflowed in Ozawa’s eyes. He could clearly hear Tang Xiu’s exclamation and the names of the Inada Society and Daikura Sakuragi.</p><p>“You wanna get your asses from here, huh?”</p><p>He noticed that Tang Xiu and Kuwako Yamamoto had already rushed out of the store. He immediately kicked several black-suited bodyguards and pursued them lightning-fast.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
