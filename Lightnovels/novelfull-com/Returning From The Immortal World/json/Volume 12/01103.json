In the midst of the sparkling light waves, many sea critters jumped out of the sea to peep into the other world outside their sea habitat.</p><p>Two luxury liners, each with accommodations for hundreds of people, quietly anchored in the middle of the sea. Multicolored lights decorated them as though they were some huge colorful gems set on the sea.</p><p>A long table with a variety of fruits and snacks and the beautiful utensils was placed on the bow deck. Crystal cups filled with red wine looking like exquisite blood liquids, two Caucasian handsome young men raised them and had a toast.</p><p>“God must be sleeping for letting you stroll around the Pacific, Will Art. The Pyramid has long ruined your Ordo company, and even rumors have it that you met Satan himself and drank with him. How the hell did you appear here now, though?” Angelo Dolan started to speak with a warm smile, yet his words were intriguing, to say the least.</p><p>Donning red pajamas, the long blonde-haired Will Art shrugged and just drank the wine from the crystal cup. He then gently picked up the white handkerchief to wipe the wine at the corner of his mouth and replied with a leisure smile, “The Lord is sleeping, huh? Dunno about that, but I’m hella sure Satan doesn’t like me so much. You’re the one Satan loves, Angelo. He didn’t come to find you, so how come he summoned me?”</p><p>The smile on Angelo’s face receded. “Oh, Dear Will, you know my character, don’t you? I never liked to beat around the bush. Just answer me, why did you come to the Pacific? Don’t tell me you’re also trying to get those treasures?”</p><p>“Well, you know. Men will die for riches as will birds for food,” replied Will Art. “The local legends say some treasures have been buried here, so of course I must try my luck too, don’t you think? But after confirming it was fake news fabricated by the Celestial Wizard Clan, I don’t give a shit anymore. Then, I might as well take this chance to relax well. I have the wine, delicacies, and beauties here. Besides, this spot isn’t that far from Saipan. Having such a leisure life here is not bad and kinda makes me fulfilled.”</p><p>“So to say, you’re on vacation now, <em>huh</em> ?” replied Angelo.</p><p>Will Art chuckled and said, “I didn’t say I’m on vacation per se, mind you. I came here to find the treasure, got it? Ahaha… that old man of mine just can’t wait to squeeze me all the time. He treats me as a bank’s money-printing machine, making me so dead tired!”</p><p>Having said that, he turned to glance at the straight line of burly men in black suits. His tone went several octaves and asked aloud, “Hey, you guys! Are you not tired?”</p><p>“No! We’re not tired, Sir!” The burly men’s group replied aloud.</p><p>Will Art rolled his eyes in response. He lackadaisically stretched his own body and groaned. “Bah, what a bunch of hypocritical bastards! You must follow my ass every day and work for money, yet you shit out like you’re not tired, huh? It seems I’m gonna treat these guys as mules and horses later.”</p><p>Angelo burst into laughter and said aloud, “Bwahaha, my dear friend Will. You’re really helpless, aren’t you?! My men will say they’re tired if I say they are and feel energetic if I say so.”</p><p>“Okay, okay, let’s cut the crap.” Will Art waved and said, “Anyways, I got some good models from the Babylonian agency; they will wait for you at the party. Don’t refuse me. I got them all checked; their skills are great!”</p><p>“Spare me the talks about chicks.” Angelo warmly smiled and said, “I originally planned to find for some time, though I never expected to meet you here. Let’s have a business chat first and have some fun later, shall we?”</p><p>Will Art picked up his brows and straightforwardly replied, “I’ve been told a million times to deal with proper business first. And you know what? I’ve always been busy from Christmas to Christmas, and that makes me tired like a snow dog. But now, I just wanna think how to get some fun and some cozy shits and earn my happiness in doing it.”</p><p>“Dear Mr. Art, I’m sure you know about the robbery of the Dante diamond mine in Africa, given your House’s intel network,” said Angelo strangely. “I don’t think to hide it from you is necessary since those who robbed it are my House Dolan’s men. However, we got some deep conflict with some local lords there, and dealing with them will be quite troublesome.”</p><p>Will Art’s face slightly changed. He shot a deep look at Angelo Dolan and emphasized every word he said in reply, “Your proposal piqued my interest, I admit. Go on. I’ll consider it if I think it’s a good proposal.”</p><p>“Well, the benefits will be like the pie falling from the sky, I assure you,” said Angelo confidently. “I’m sure nobody will refuse it unless his brain is dead. I need your house to help me solve these poor and backward places in Africa to silence these local lords’ heads. I’ll give 20% of the profits to your House. How about it?”</p><p>Eyes flickering, Will Art thought for a few minutes. He slowly stretched out his fingers and said, “I want 40%.”</p><p>Angelo glared at him and yelled, “What the fuck? My House Dolan suffered huge losses just to rob that Dante diamond mine and now you want 40%? Are you insane or this world has gone crazy? That’s impossible. Even if I give you my word, my family’s elders will never agree to it!”</p><p>“Don’t make it sounds like a tragedy, will you?” Will Art sneered. “Those who robbed the Dante diamond mine didn’t suffer any losses at all. House Art can still investigate this info ourselves. Alright, I’ll lower my appetite. 30%. Lower than that, and my House Art won’t take it. You can seek others for cooperation.”</p><p><em>‘30%?!’</em></p><p>It was a figure Angelo could still accept. In actuality, the situation in Africa was very complicated. Let alone 30%, he was even ready to share 50% of the revenue. Of course, he would naturally play some tricks to lower the price as much as possible to get his House a bigger share.</p><p>“Alright, deal!”</p><p>Angelo Dolan and Will Art looked at each other. Both happily smiled in similar fashion at the same time.</p><p>The latter then clapped and a big man suddenly rushed into the cabin. A few minutes later, four voluptuous blondes came out with him. Will Art looked at Angelo Dolan and grinningly said, “Well, how about having some fun together? Two for each?</p><p>Angelo liked women, especially female models who often showed up in public because some of them he had played with maybe would suddenly become a sensation and a superstar someday. However, he still had something to deal with, so he shook his head. “I already told you we gotta chat some serious shits first. Some friends will come over later, so let’s wait for them.”</p><p>“Some friends? Who?” Will Art was surprised.</p><p>“Demonfreak geezer,” said Angelo Dolan smilingly.</p><p>Will Art abruptly got up from the chair with a look of dread and hastily said, “My dear old buddy Angelo, are you fucking crazy? Why did you call that Demonfreak geezer? He’s a madman who tinkers with the dead nearly every day! You damn shit! I knew it. No way in hell any pie will fall from the sky. I thought I just secured a big deal, I never thought I’d encounter such bad luck!”</p><p>“Ehh? Why do you sound like you’re so afraid of that old devil, though?” said Angelo strangely. “Is it coz he keeps missing you, or you got enmity or something with him?”</p><p>“Nah, I got no enmity with that fella. But he got me into a shithole when he robbed some treasures from my House.” Will Art waved and said, “Alas, I really want to blow him up to make him return my family’s treasures.”</p><p>Angelo pointed to the row of strong men nearby and grinningly said, “Can you pack up that old devil with these men you brought, though?”</p><p>A strange light flashed in Will Art’s eyes and he proudly declared. “Even if they can’t get rid of that fella, they won’t lose either.”</p><p>“Young Master.”</p><p>A belle with swaying slender waist in professional attire and gold-rimmed glasses walked out of the cabin. She squatted beside Angelo and whispered, “We just spotted a liner heading toward us a few nautical miles away.</p><p>Angelo furrowed his brows and grinningly said, “The Chinese said you speak of the Devil and the Devil will come to you. If my guess is correct, it should be that old devil with his men.”</p><p>Will Art rolled his eyes and groaned. “You know, I really hoped I’d never seen him. Nothing good ever happens every time I bump into him.”</p><p>Quickly after, a luxury liner slowly approached. When Angelo and Willy saw the Demonfreak geezer standing on the bow deck, the former stood up, stretching out his arms and smilingly saying aloud, “Hey, Demonfreak geezer. Welcome!”</p><p>The luxury liner anchored and Demonfreak geezer looked surprised, before letting out a dry laugh. “Haha, Angelo Dolan, you’re really impatient and can’t wait to see Satan yourself, right?! To think that you’re so happy because of my arrival, must I say I feel honored or what?”</p><p>The smile on Angelo’s face receded. He furrowed his brows and said, “Hey, Demonfreak geezer, that’s not a fucking happy joke, you hear?”</p><p>“He’s not joking since you’ll definitely great your great god, the Satan himself, today.” Tang Xiu led Tang Guang and the rest out of the cabin and came to the side of Demonfreak geezer. The latter bowed and then moved behind Tang Xiu.</p><p>Wariness and vigilance filled Angelo Dolan’s eyes, and he even felt a bit shocked inwardly. He knew Demonfreak geezer’s attitude and was perfectly aware that this old devil was not only ruthless and cold-blooded, but also extremely arrogant. But who exactly was that young man? And why did Demonfreak geezer act so respectful towards him?”</p><p>“Who are you?” Angelo retreated a few steps. As his men quickly gathered up at his side, he grimly asked.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
