Do you know why he took the risk to steal it?”</p><p>“Did Chang Zhao pull the strings?” asked Chang Guoxin in shock.</p><p>“He didn’t pull the strings but rather force him to do so,” answered Tang Xiu lightly. “Your cherished nephew kidnapped his wife and kid while extorting him 2 million yuan for them. You think you can cut off your relationship with him and rid yourself of the problem when those people above investigate it?”</p><p>Chang Guoxin furiously shouted, “How damn bold that bastard is! Young Master Tang, please find me a way to suppress this problem. That bastard brat. I… I’m going to give him a severe lesson!”</p><p>“Well, he’s been acting quite arrogant and conceited before me, though. You gotta use your brain as for how to tell him,” added Tang Xiu.</p><p>Having said that, Tang Xiu threw the phone to the incredulous-looking Chang Zhao and indifferently said, “You wanna see the power I have and how many people do I have to call, right? I only need one phone call to make you kowtow and apologize to me. Pick it up! I’m sure you can hear who the man I’ve been speaking with is.”</p><p>Chang Zhao’s hands trembled as he caught the phone. If there were people in this world who could make him afraid, then his uncle, Chang Guoxin, was definitely one.</p><p>“Umm…”</p><p>Chang Zhao tried to speak but was interrupted just after he began speaking.</p><p>“What ‘umm’ you bastard?! Do you know how much trouble you’ve caused? House Tang is the top family that even I must curry favor with and rely on if I want to go further one or two ranks. Yet you dare to fight with Young Master Tang Xiu of House Tang? Who the hell gave you the balls, Goddammit?!!” Chang Guoxin’s furious roar was heard from the phone.</p><p>The Young Master of House Tang, Tang Xiu?!!</p><p>Chang Zhao’s face turned deathly white in an instant. Only then did he finally realize why he felt that Tang Xiu looked rather familiar the first time he saw him. It turned out he was <em>that</em> Tang Xiu of House Tang! The future successor of House Tang that the current Head had been fostering! He was also the owner of Magnificent Tang Corporation and hailed in China as the illustrious young Divine Doctor.</p><p><em>I’m done for!</em></p><p>He had poked the hornet’s nest. Even if he didn’t die, he’d be at least be skinned alive!</p><p>The furious roar of his uncle came again from the phone. “I don’t give a damn what you do, but you must allay Young Master Tang’s anger! And beg him to save your own sorry life! Else, I won’t be able to save your ass and I’ll even be implicated by you! You can even expect that I’ll be stripped off of my military uniform!”</p><p>Chang Zhao was dumbfounded and immediately panicked. “Uncle, it won’t go so far like… I…”</p><p>“Bastard! Have you just gotten so idle since you’re full already? Why the hell did you kidnap Li Yuquan’s wife and kid? Do you know what he did for that 2 million? It’s enough to behead you 100 times and you won’t get away scot-free for forcing him to get the money. Now, listen to me. You can never imagine how huge Tang Xiu’s identity is. I can’t even save you, he’s the only one who can save your ass now! You’d better handle this problem well yourself, Brat. Or I’ll definitely break your legs when you come back!”</p><p>Chang Zhao’s mind was so battered that he was scared out of his wits after the phone hung up. He looked at Tang Xiu and Li Yuquan with eyes full of intense fear.</p><p>He had been very conceited indeed! But it didn’t mean that he was desperate. He was even more vulnerable than ordinary people when he must face the threat of death himself. He perfectly realized that catastrophe had already fallen and only one person could save him now, which was Tang Xiu who he just offended.</p><p><em>Drop…</em></p><p>Pacing two steps forward to Tang Xiu’s front, Chang Zhao directly knelt on the floor. Remorse could be seen on his handsome face along with worries. His lips squirmed and he said, “Young Master Tang, this Chang Zhao’s eyes truly failed to recognize Mt. Tai. I didn’t recognize you before. It’s all my fault, I shouldn’t have done such despicable deeds. But please don’t stoop down to my level. You… you can beat and do whatever you like to me, but please rid of your anger and help me.”</p><p>At the side, Xue Zengmei was completely dumbstruck. What Tang Xiu said on the phone had given her a bad feeling, and now her heart was full of turbulence and dread upon seeing how Chang Zhao was acting now.</p><p><em>Young Master Tang? He’s the Young Master of House Tang from Beijing to whom Chang Guoxin has been relying on?</em></p><p>Only those surnamed Tang could make Chang Zhao beg like that after his rude remarks, right?</p><p>Xue Zengmei shifted her vision from Chang Zhao’s face to Tang Xiu’s indifferent face. She felt that she should say something, but then recalled her own attitude and Chang Zhao’s toward Tang Xiu before, causing her to swallow the words back.</p><p>Speak what, exactly? Beg for Chang Zhao?</p><p>It wasn’t like Xue Zengmei was not aware of her own status. Her family may be closely related to the Changs, but they clearly had no relationship with House Tang whatsoever. Would even the other party respond to her if she asked for such a favor?</p><p>Suddenly, she recalled Tang Xiu’s request previously and slowly spoke, “Mr. Tang, I apologize to you for my previous boldness. You can rest assured that I’ll close my teahouse starting from today.”</p><p>Tang Xiu shot her an indifferent glance and immediately replied, “You can consider it that you’ve learned a lesson. It’s always better to suffer some losses than losing much more later. I want you to never reveal anything that happened today, else the lesson you’ll get won’t be as minor as this. You go out first!”</p><p>It wasn’t like Xue Zengmei didn’t feel indignant. She may be a woman from an affluent rich family, but she had never relied on her own family all these years and had been a self-made woman instead. Never once had she ever been threatened by anyone. Yet, she also realized that Tang Xiu’s power and abilities were not something she could fight against, so she could only forbear it while suppressing her anger inside as she turned around and left.</p><p>Tang Xiu’s eyes then shifted to Chang Zhao, who was kneeling in front of him, and said, “If you knew it would be like this, then why did you do it the first place? Being young is all fine and great, but breaking the law and committing crimes is very shameful to your family. But less chitchat, release Li Yuquan’s wife and kid.”</p><p>Chang Zhao hurriedly complied and turned to the four dumbstruck and shocked bodyguards who were completely petrified. “What the hell are you staring at? Just bring Li Yuquan’s wife and kid here!”</p><p>One of them looked hesitated and wryly smiled. “The woman is fine, but his son… umm, both his legs… are broken. Don’t you think we have to send him to the hospital first?”</p><p>Chang Zhao’s pupils shrunk and the chill that ran on his back filled his heart with fear.</p><p>“What did you say?!!”</p><p>Li Yuquan’s face was full of disbelief as he dashed to the bodyguard and grabbed his collar with a stare that was as though spitting flames.</p><p>The bodyguard’s lips wriggled as he blurted out, “This can’t be blamed on us. If you want to blame someone, blame your own son for being too ruthless even at such a tender age! Young Master Chang… almost turned into a eunuch because he kicked him. I was on the scene at that time, so I witnessed everything. Young Master Chang rolled about on the floor and screamed about for a long time.”</p><p>Li Yuquan released the guy and immediately turned around, ferociously staring daggers at Chang Zhao and shouted, “My son is only 8 years old and he’ll never hit people easily!”</p><p>Chang Zhao glanced at Tang Xiu and forced a smile. “Your son does look weak and doesn’t look like a boy, but he’s actually very ruthless and fierce. His kick made me unable to touch women for more than half a month. I was fortunate that I got sent to the hospital in time for treatment, or I wouldn’t be able to touch any woman for the rest of my life.”</p><p>Tang Xiu waved to interrupted them and said, “Spare me the chitchat, will you? Just bring them over immediately. I’m a medical practitioner myself, I can treat him if it’s not some major problem.”</p><p>Chang Zhao suddenly remembered Tang Xiu’s identity and immediately nodded. “Yeah, that’s right. Young Master Tang is a famous Divine Doctor in the country. I’m sure he’ll be able to heal your son given his abilities. And you guys, stop staring silly like that, will you? Quickly bring them over here… please.”</p><p>Quite quickly, Li Yuquan’s wife and son were brought to the office. The woman was weeping as the couple met, whereas Li Yuquan’s eyes were teary despite not crying.</p><p><em>Bam…</em></p><p>Li Yuquan, who had witnessed what Tang Xiu was capable of now, as well as learned that he was also an illustrious young Divine Doctor in China, directly knelt before Tang Xiu and said in tears, “Mr. Tang, please help my son. He’s still very young and his life will be ruined if he becomes disabled. My life may not be worth anything, but you can have it if you can heal him.”</p><p>Tang Xiu sighed inwardly. The legs of this seven-plus-year-old boy were indeed seriously injured. His knees were even bleeding, apparently caused by a blunt weapon. Anyone with discerning eyes could tell that even the top medical treatment in the world wouldn’t be able to make them recover. This boy could only live sitting in a wheelchair all his life.</p><p>“Are you sure you have really made up your mind on that?” asked Tang Xiu faintly.</p><p>“I am!” replied Li Yuquan categorically.</p><p>Tang Xiu nodded. “Tell that woman who was here before to immediately prepare some water, gauze, and gypsum board. If she doesn’t have them, tell her to go to the nearby hospital to buy them immediately. All of you wait outside while I treat him.”</p><p>After a while, only Tang Xiu and the boy whose eyes were full of tears remained in the office. The boy himself tried hard not to cry and tightly gripped his fists. His willpower was remarkable; not even a sound came out of his mouth no matter how painful it was.</p><p>Tang Xiu didn’t immediately treat him but looked at the boy leaning on the sofa and asked, “Are you going to despair if you can only live in a wheelchair in the future?”</p><p>The boy’s lips shivered, but he shook his head without a word. Then, he said, “I know my own reason for beating him and getting beaten. They want to make things difficult for my father. As long as they no longer target him, I’ll accept the fact that I have to live with the wheelchair later.”</p><p>“Are you really <em>that</em> willing?” asked Tang Xiu again with a faint smile.</p><p>“I don’t prefer that myself, but nothing I can do about it either.” The boy shook his head. “Uncle, my legs hurt so much that the bones are exposed. I already know what I’m going to be in the future, though I’m indeed a bit sad…”</p><p>“What are you feeling sad for?” asked Tang Xiu.</p><p>“It’s because I’m afraid I won’t be able to become a heroic man with an unyielding spirit like Dad,” answered the boy.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
