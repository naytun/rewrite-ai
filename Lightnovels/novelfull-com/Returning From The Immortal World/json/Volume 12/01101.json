He knew that with the latter’s strength, killing him was easy. But he patiently said so much to him, even his subordinate explained some things to him while he waited patiently. It turned out that he wanted to make him submit to work for him in the future.</p><p>“I give you my word.”</p><p>The old devil knew the truth, that only those who acted according to circumstances would survive. He hadn’t had enough with living. Even with his current cultivation, he could only live for another century. It was better to live than to die, to begin with. Some freedom may be lost, but it was his best choice at present.</p><p>Tang Xiu paced forward, appeared before the Demonfreak geezer and lightly said, “Give up resistance and open your mind. I need to cast the Soul Ruling Art in your body. I’ll choose the time to unseal this control over you later in the future if you’re obedient and make contributions.”</p><p>“Alright.”</p><p>The old man looked like a gambler who had thrown his dice and stakes at this moment. He removed all his defenses as per Tang Xiu’s instruction and let him plant the Soul Ruling Art seed in his body.</p><p>“Hmm?!”</p><p>The instant Tang Xiu did it, the geezer’s heart trembled. He sensed a faint energy fluctuation in a hidden spot inside his heart. But due to that faint energy, he felt like there was a thread that connected him to Tang Xiu.</p><p>Tang Xiu then issued an order to stop the killing of Demonfreak’s men. Then, he lightly said, “I’m your boss from now on. I need you to work on something for the time being. Which is to find me those SOE people and the best genius of House Dolan, Angelo.”</p><p>A bit of awe could be seen in Demonfreak’s eyes. It was the kind of emotion directly caused by the influence of the soul contract. He gave Tang Xiu a deep look and said in a deep voice, “I have a way to contact Angelo, Boss. Just give me half a day and I’ll know where he is.”</p><p>Raising his brows, Tang Xiu shortly realized that Demonfreak geezer had spoken the truth before. His relationship with the SOE company and House Dolan was very likely to have more than met the eye.</p><p>“What exactly is your relationship with them?”</p><p>“The SOE company is my partner, and we have jointly founded a genetic research lab to secretly study the genes’ working mechanism.” The old man explained, “This Cadaveric Beast I’ve been raising has been injected by the strongest gene agent there was and I’ve been gradually improving its strength with my refining and tempering method. That’s why it ultimately has the power on par with an early-stage Golden Core cultivator now. Further, I’ve had a lot of cooperation with House Dolan, all of which pertain to silencing and neutralizing people and robbing them of their possessions. They gave payment—you can say it’s a salary—while I and Dao Master Poison were responsible to deal with things for them.”</p><p>“That’d be great.” Tang Xiu nodded. “You can win their trust because of this track record. It seems not killing today is the right choice. However, I can’t say the same with regard to your men. I’ll leave them to you to deal with. But you must remove any unreliable ones, for you yourself will be implicated should our relationship be exposed.”</p><p>The old devil pondered for a moment and nodded. “I got it, Boss.”</p><p>Having said that, his figure suddenly dove down and instantly came to his remaining dozen men. As he grasped a sharp dagger, an afterimage of his figure flashed and the big man in a black night suit held his throat and heart before he fell.</p><p>Of the tens of people, only 18 remained. But there was not the slightest fear on their faces upon witnessing Demonfreak’s killing. It was like the old devil killing them was a normal occurrence.</p><p>“All of you, draw back!”</p><p>Tang Xiu opened the entrance of the Bloodseed Array and watched as everyone left quickly disappeared from the array. His eyes looked around at the many pairs of eyes and then began concocting pills.</p><p>The battle was between the Ravengale and the Speeder, and then the old devil came with his men to fight the former… which turned out to be a fight against the Stygian Club’s people. In addition to the people ordered to be cleaned up by Tang Xiu’s order, the number of casualties exceeded 500.</p><p>Time passed by and three hours had elapsed in the blink of an eye.</p><p>When Tang Xiu’s figure appeared outside the Bloodseed Array, it was as if the whole world turned quiet.</p><p><em>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</em></p><p>Figures moved lightning-fast from the distance and rushed toward Tang Xiu in an instant. Most of them had longing looks and a few had an inquiry on their faces upon seeing Tang Xiu.</p><p>Tang Xiu let out a vague smile and immediately deactivated the Bloodseed Array. 12 Sanguine Pills were floating in front of the Speeder’s HQ building as he instantly collected them all.</p><p>“Demonfreak geezer, take your men and clean up the scene. Try not to leave too many traces and supervise the things here. Then, take your men to Lao Bay Resort later to find me.” Tang Xiu ordered as he then led Tang Guang and away.</p><p>Demonfreak geezer looked to be in high spirits. He could sense the energy fluctuations from the Sanguine Pills Tang Xiu just refined. The Cadaveric Beast, particularly, transmitted its desire and thirst for those pills. Thus, it was obvious that those pills were absolutely a good thing.</p><p>“Clean up the scene, guys!”</p><p>He issued an order and his vision turned to the direction where Tang Xiu and the rest disappeared. He had a vague hunch that Tang Xiu ordered him to take his men to find him at the Lao Bay Resort and not directly contact Angelo Dolan. That meant he should have a share of those 12 Sanguine Pills.</p><p>At Lao Bay Resort.</p><p>After Tang Xiu brought his men back, he received the news from Tom Reggie. At this time, this guy brought a lot of men and kept cleaning up the remnants of the Ravengale. Although the resistance was tough and especially tenacious along the way, he had assistance from experts such as Mo Awu, who was at the Golden Core Stage. His momentum alone was like pulling weeds by the roots and killing all resistance.</p><p>The entire day left Saipan in chaos and the policemen under the command of Song Guanghui cleverly avoided all the scenes of battle between the underground forces. Oftentimes, he commanded the police force to come to the spots after the battle long ended and concluded.</p><p>When the new day arrived with its greeting Sun from the East, Tom Reggie hurried back to Lao Bay Resort with a few of his confidants. He was slightly injured when appeared before Tang Xiu.</p><p>“Are you okay?” asked Tang Xiu while observing him.</p><p>“It’s nothing, no serious injuries.” Tom Reggie shook his head and said, “Our men now control all the underground forces in Saipan, though it may take a few days to handle the aftermath work. But I believe I can handle it well myself.”</p><p>“Just keep in mind not to take it lightly.” Tang Xiu nodded with satisfaction and continued, “There are tigers and dragons blended in with the underground forces of Saipan, many of whom come from various countries, so we’ll keep staying here for several days more. We’ll leave after the situation has been completely stabilized.”</p><p>Tom Reggie shifted his vision to Mo Awu who came back with him and hesitantly asked, “Boss, can you let Mo Awu assist me? I found a lot of powerful people while cleaning up the remaining underground forces. Fortunately, he acted and killed them, else we wouldn’t have been able to control the entire underground forces of Saipan in such a short period of time.”</p><p>“Alright, go tend to your business and let Mo Awu stay with me first,” replied Tang Xiu. “But do call me at once if you’re in a dangerous situation. I’ll arrange some people to help you deal with it. That’s right, lemme introduce you to him. This is Demonfreak geezer, he’ll be one of ours in the future. You can take his men to deal with your business when you leave Lao Bay Resort!”</p><p>Tom himself had seen this Demonfreak geezer and also knew that this geezer was very strong. A surprised look immediately cast on his face upon hearing Tang Xiu’s words.</p><p>Demonfreak geezer himself didn’t say much and just ordered his 18 men to follow Tom Reggie’s arrangement. Then, he silently stayed beside Tang Xiu. As of now, he was more and more curious about Tang Xiu because he really couldn’t figure out which forces Tang Xiu exactly came from, since there was no monastic sect existence called “Tang Sect” in the entire cultivation society in China.</p><p>As the sun fully rose from the East, Tang Xiu stood by the window on the second floor of the villa, watching Tom Reggie leave in a rush with his group. He turned to look at Mo Awu, Tang Guang, Hao Lei, Kuwako Yamamoto, and the surprised-looking Demonfreak geezer.</p><p>“I give you guys two days to fully absorb all the energy contained in this Sanguine Pill!”</p><p>As his voice faded away, he flicked five Sanguine Pills and each fell onto the hands of these five people.</p><p>The eyes of Mo Awu, Tang Guang, Hao Lei, and Kuwako lit up. They held the Sanguine Pill and immediately rushed to their own respective room, ready to seize the time to absorb and refine it. Demonfreak geezer, however, hesitated and inquired. “What effect does this Sanguine Pill have, Boss?”</p><p>“I don’t know what kind of cultivation art you’ve been practicing. But it doesn’t matter since taking this Sanguine Pill will be greatly beneficial for you,” replied Tang Xiu lightly. “At the very least, I’ll make you advance to the late-stage of Golden Core without a problem. It was quite a pity there was only one Golden Core when I refined the Sanguine Pills, though. if I were to add yours then, I could have made mid-stage Golden Core Stage cultivators to directly advance to the Nascent Soul Stage.”</p><p>Cough, cough…</p><p>Although Demonfreak geezer was shocked inwardly, he couldn’t help but cough awkwardly a few times. Yet, he was cursing in his heart: If my Golden Core were to be added to the refining of this blood elixir, then I’d have been good as dead already! Ugh, disregarding my feelings like that… so merciless!</p><p>Suddenly, he looked down at his feet and hesitantly said, “Boss, I can sense the craving from my Cadaveric Beast. Can… you give me another Sanguine Pill to feed it?</p><p>Tang Xiu rolled his eyes and coldly hmphed. “Hmph, do you really think a Sanguine Pill is like rotten cabbage you can just pick up on the street?! Giving such a good thing to this beast is nothing but a reckless waste! Demonfreak geezer, I know you’ve spent lots of resources and efforts to raise this Cadaveric Beast, but I have an advice for you. Real experts only rely on their own strength and never from the external help of some evils from demonic ways. Further, you can expect to face great danger once this beast’s strength surpasses yours in the future.”</p><p>Demonfreak geezer incredulously asked, “You mean… the role will reverse between us?”</p><p>“Without my help, you can expect it to go against you and act as your Master once its strength surpasses yours.” Tang Xiu nodded. “It can kill you or enslave you. Snake-type creatures are the most ruthless. You may raise them for many years, yet that bit of emotion will never affect their nature.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
