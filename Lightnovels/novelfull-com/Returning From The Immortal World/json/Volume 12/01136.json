He then looked at Ouyang Lulu, who lackadaisically sat on the sofa. A smile sported on his face as he asked, “Don’t you want to take a shower?”</p><p>Ouyang Lulu pouted and unhappily said, “We agreed you’d go shopping with me, to taste some delicacies and watch movies today. But at the end of the day, everything’s delayed just because of your patient’s treatment. This tender baby’s heart is pained and she has no power left to bathe.”</p><p>Tang Xiu couldn’t help laughing and said, “How can you be like a child, though? Well, it wasn’t like I wanted this either. Alright, alright. I’ll keep you accompany all day tomorrow.”</p><p>The grievance on Ouyang Lulu’s face instantly disappeared. She bounced up from the sofa instead and smilingly said, “That’s a deal! No taking it back, got it?”</p><p>“Deal!” Tang Xiu smilingly nodded.</p><p>As Ouyang Lulu entered the bathroom and the sound of water was heard from the inside, Tang Xiu fished out his cell phone and dialed Mu Wanying’s number. After his call was connected, he said, “Wanying, I’m in the Blue Starfish Mansion right now since I suddenly learned that Li Cai brought her mother here. Hence why I came to examine the patient’s condition.”</p><p>“Can you treat her?”</p><p>Although Mu Wanying was somewhat at a loss and dissatisfied due to Tang Xiu’s sudden departure, she still asked concernedly out of kindness.</p><p>“It can still be treated, but will take quite a lot of hard work.” Tang Xiu smilingly said, “Anyway, it’s too late, so I won’t go back tonight.”</p><p>“Then rest well and have a good sleep.” Mu Wanying replied, “Also, I may not have time to accompany you for the next few days. The company sent me a notice in the afternoon that there’s an important business which requires my presence.”</p><p>“Alright, then. Just call me when you’re done,” said Tang Xiu.</p><p>After hanging up, Tang Xiu could only apologize to Mu Wanying and felt sorry for her inwardly. But then again, the crazy girl Ouyang Lulu was always difficult to deal with. He wouldn’t be able to figure out where and when she’d rush to find him if he didn’t accompany her well enough. But after spending time with Ouyang Lulu all day long, he found that she had been diligent in her cultivation as her cultivation had been steadily improving. Even now she had reached mid-stage of Foundation Establishment.</p><p>“Taking medicinal pills is good, but still, the foundation is very important!”</p><p>Tang Xiu couldn’t help but sigh secretly. Although he was perfectly aware that his women and subordinates had taken a lot of pills for their rapid growth, there was no way around it to let them grow as fast as possible. As for the foundation problems, as long as they reached the Spirit Formation Stage, he would take them to the Immortal World wherein he could find the way to obtain the Immortal Spirit Liquid from some mystical place there. The root cause of the problem for their shaky foundation would be completely lifted up if they took it.</p><p>The clock hit ten at night.</p><p>The gentle light of the crystal lamp illuminated another room like it was daytime. Li Cai’s body sent out a faint scent as she stood before the mirror while constantly observing her own skin. She just realized that her skin turned a bit different from before after taking the shower and looking herself in the mirror.</p><p>It could be said that if you used to have rough and fragile skin, it was now very smooth and tender.</p><p>“Can you not keep looking at the mirror, Cai’er? Just tell me, what did Tang Xiu do to you? You seem to have changed in just one day. Not only does your skin look much smoother, but your height is also about two or three centimeters higher than before.” Hu Shaokun sat on the sofa behind Li Cai and spoke that carried out the shock he felt.</p><p>Li Cai turned around and she blinked while asking, “What did you just say, Brother Shaokun? I’m two or three centimeters higher than I used to be?”</p><p>“Yea, I just realized it when we entered the room together.” Hu Shaokun nodded and said, “I surely remember that your height only reached my shoulder, but you’re now almost reaching my chin. It’s only one day, yet you’re taller by at least two or three centimeters, maybe even more.”</p><p>Li Cai gulped down and the brilliance in her eyes was even more intense, muttering, “Amazing. This is really too amazing. Divine Doctor Tang is truly like a Deity or something. I don’t think anyone can be more amazing than him in this world.”</p><p>No matter how unhappy it was for Hu Shaokun to see Li Cai praising Tang Xiu before himself, but he must admit that Tang Xiu did really have the ability. Such a method was even a miracle for himself.</p><p>“Just tell me quickly, what did Tang Xiu do to you, Cai’er?”</p><p>Li Cai came back to her senses. She hesitated but then spoke, “I can’t tell you much about that, Brother Shaokun. It’s because I already promised him not to disclose anything to anyone. However, please believe Divine Doctor Tang. He’s very great and amazingly capable, and probably can be compared to some celestial beings. Please don’t get incensed. I can tell you that he has taught me a lot of things, even from the things he just taught me are more than enough for me to address him as my Master!”</p><p>Hu Shaokun fell into silence. He was well aware of Li Cai’s character. She wouldn’t budge if she had promised something. She complied with Tang Xiu to keep everything a secret, which was very likely that he would never get the answer even if he kept asking. However, there was still another issue came to his mind, so he went on, “Cai’er, I won’t ask you anything about the things Tang Xiu taught you. But you gotta answer me another one.”</p><p>“What is it?” asked Li Cai.</p><p>“Divine Doctor Tang previously said that he can prolong your lifespan. Is that true?” asked Hu Shaokun.</p><p>The girl hesitated for a moment before nodding. “It should be true, I think. You’ve also seen how different I am now, right? Divine Doctor Tang gave me a very mysterious pill. Not only can it change my physique, but I also faintly felt that I’ve really returned to my true teenage years when I was full of vigor and spirit.”</p><p>Upon hearing this, Hu Shaokun’s complexion changed and he quickly asked again, “Did he say when he’s going to treat Aunt Zhuang?”</p><p>“He gave me a few pills that seem to be called Life Essence Pills or something like that,” said Li U Cai. “He said he’ll treat Mom when I finished taking these pills.”</p><p>Hu Shaokun seemed to be thinking of something and decided to see Tang Xiu himself, so he waved and said, “Alright, then you should rest well, Cai’er! I’m going to have a chat with Doctor Tang Xiu.”</p><p>“Ah, wait up. I’m going too!” Li Cai hurriedly blurted out.</p><p>“What for?” asked Hu Shaokun helplessly.</p><p>“I haven’t eaten anything until now, alright?” said Li Cai. “Though I don’t feel hungry even a bit, still, I gotta fill my belly with something. Ah, that’s right, did you arrange anyone to deliver food to Divine Doctor Tang, by chance? He hasn’t eaten anything either today.”</p><p>Hu Shaokun immediately slapped his own forehead upon hearing this. “Alas, that’s my fault. I was too negligent. I’m going to arrange it now.”</p><p>Not long after, more than ten fragrant dishes were sent to the room where Tang Xiu was staying. Li Cai came together with the attendants and smilingly said, “Divine Doctor Tang, Sis Ouyang, it’s been hard on you both today, so I asked Brother Shaokun to prepare a meal. Shall we dine together?”</p><p>“Fine with me!”</p><p>Ouyang Lulu herself was very fond of Li Cai, so she threw the white towel she used to wipe her hair to the side, walking to the girl and pulling her hand in response.</p><p>“What about Hu Shaokun?” asked Tang Xiu.</p><p>“He previously wanted to come along and said there’s something he’d like to speak about with you,” said Li Cai. “But then I heard there’s a friend of his surnamed Hao, who has been waiting for him all day long, so he went to his friend first. Also, m-may… I ask you one thing, Divine Doctor Tang?”</p><p>“Alright, go ahead.” Tang Xiu nodded.</p><p>As Li Cai looked at him, the expectation in her eyes betrayed her. “Doctor Tang, can… can I call you a Teacher in the future?”</p><p>“Me? Teacher?” Tang Xiu’s expression turned weird.</p><p>“You taught me so much knowledge, Divine Doctor Tang. Not only that, but you also gave me something like grace of rebirth,” explained Li Cai hurriedly. “That’s why I think I should call you Teacher to express my respect for you.”</p><p>Tang Xiu lit a cigarette while looking at the several waiters quickly putting the dishes on the table. They even put a few bottles of red wine and then quickly left. He then slowly spit out the smoke at this time and shook his head. “Your mother is still alive, so I can’t receive you as a disciple. The bad karma tied to her is very heavy, and once we’re tied as Master and disciple, I’m afraid that the bad karma will immediately turn to you. Even if I cut off the spread of that bad karmic ties with my supernatural power temporarily, it’s very likely that my cultivation would be affected.”</p><p>“Bad karma?” Li Cai was puzzled and asked, “What exactly is bad karma, though?”</p><p>“I advise you not to ask more about that.” Tang Xiu forced a smile and explained, “It will otherwise greatly impact your state of mind and heart. This kind of influence will make it difficult for you to achieve much in your cultivation in the future.”</p><p>“But I really want to know it since it’s about my mother’s issue,” said Li Cai adamantly. “Learning how to cultivate from you is already a lucky thing for me, Divine Doctor Tang, so I’m not afraid of how much influence it will affect me in the future.”</p><p>With a sigh, Tang Xiu said, “Then I’ll tell you if you insist. Your mother’s past incarnation has sinned beyond what I’ve imagined. Even I must lay down a feng shui array to shield the detection of the Heaven when I treated her, else it would’ve caused me great harm instead.”</p><p>Eyes shrunk, Li Cai hurriedly shook her head and said, “You must be mistaken, Divine Doctor Tang. Mom was always a kind person who’s even afraid to injure small critters. How can she possibly have committed heavy sins?”</p><p>“I’m talking about what she did in her past life,” replied Tang Xiu. “I told you previously that you both are very lucky to run into me, else that evil bad karma will keep haunting her in her next reincarnation and affect her every future life to no end.”</p><p>Li Cai stared blankly at Tang Xiu and asked, “What exactly did she do in her past life?”</p><p>“Murders,” said Tang Xiu in a deep voice. “The number of living beings she killed exceeds the number of people on this planet.”</p><p>“Come again?!!”</p><p>Li Cai exclaimed, disbelief overflowing from her eyes. Although she wasn’t sure how many people lived on Earth, the number was definitely around seven-plus billion people. But saying that the number of people her mother killed in her past life was more than seven-plus billion?</p><p>This… how can that be? Where in the world were so many people for her to kill, to begin with?</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
