A golden glove unknowingly appeared on his right fist that was now about to hit Tang Xiu’s head.</p><p>“On par with Golden Core Stage, huh?”</p><p>A contemptuous look appeared on Tang Xiu’s face. The Bloodguzzler dagger suddenly appeared in his hand and instantly stabbed Wei Xianyong’s body before the latter’s fist hit Tang Xiu’s head. The violent Primal Chaos Force followed the dagger and drilled into Wei Xianyong’s system.</p><p>“WHAT?!!”</p><p>With a drastically changed face, Wei Xianyong was horrified. He never dreamed that Tang Xiu’s speed would be so fast, giving him no chance to react at all.</p><p>Yet, it wasn’t over. His expression was that of desperation in just less than half a second since the violent Primal Chaos Force in his body was overwhelming him, wreaking havoc and making his internals a mess after drilling into his system.</p><p>Such heart-wrenching pain was something Wei Xianyong had never tasted for more than a decade. He suddenly retreated but then found that Tang Xiu was like a maggot that followed his bones. His seemingly slow movements turned out to be fast to the extreme. The following blow on his chest brought an enormous impact force that straightly broke his breastbone, with two fractures stabbing his heart.</p><p><em>He… isn’t he way too terrifying? A cultivator—at least at the Nascent Soul Stage?</em></p><p><em>Curse it…</em></p><p>Desperation was getting evident on Wei Xianyong’s face. Blood crazily spurted out from his mouth, but a fist carrying a huge force hit the back of his head again, rendering him dizzy as he was sent flying. He could only sense his body turn into a punching bag that kept being hit with at least 10,000 pounds each punch, causing his injury to get worse and more serious.</p><p><em>BAM…</em></p><p>After several seconds, Tang Xiu delivered a slap while keeping a faint smile all the while, looking as Wei Xianyong, who now looked like a dead dog, was sent flying upside down a dozen meters away before heavily slamming on the cold concrete. He didn’t straightly kill the man but only made him disabled by breaking his bones one by one, causing him to stumble like mud on the floor, unable to get up.</p><p>“Sir!!!”</p><p>“Asshole!”</p><p>Five men under Wei Xianyong frantically charged toward Tang Xiu, all of whom looked like they were ready to perish together in the attempt to kill Tang Xiu.</p><p>“Heh, a few fireflies dare to contend with the moon?”</p><p>Shooting them a contemptuous glare, Tang Xiu instantly unleashed the divine sword. Layers of sword image were as though roaring waves that directly drowned these men. As the sword images dissipated, Tang Xiu took back the divine sword into his body, leaving muddy paste of bloody meat sprinkled on the ground.</p><p>Near to the scene, Jin Shi turned into a deadly and ruthless incarnation of himself. He had killed six or seven of Wen Xianyong’s men in just half a minute, whereas Chen Zhizhong still had his power even though his memory was shrouded. Especially his powerful physical strength that almost reached the peak of dreadfully strong. Every time he brandished the spear, it was a sure hit that heavily injured the target. In just half a minute, he also had slain four or five men.</p><p>“DIE!”</p><p>When the last of Wei Xianyong’s men were hit by both of them and killed, the two men quickly gathered around Tang Xiu and vigilantly watched the surroundings.</p><p>In other areas.</p><p>Duanmu Lin strode fast into the club’s interior. His eyes were almost popping out from its socket upon witnessing how the members of Darkwind organization kept trying to resist but kept falling back weakly on the floor.</p><p>That was outright unthinkable!</p><p>He had fantasized about the countless possibilities, including an ambush by the people Tang Xiu had planted in the club. Yet, he never thought that these Darkwind members would be paralyzed on the floor, likely having been poisoned and lost their ability to resist.</p><p><em>What did he say again? Killing them will be as easy as chopping watermelons?</em></p><p>Only at this moment did Duanmu Lin finally understand what Tang Xiu said previously. The current conditions of these Darkwind members really seemed to provide such a chance to kill them as easy as chopping watermelons.</p><p><em>Whoosh…</em></p><p>A figure flickered fast from the distance and quickly arrived a few meters away from Duanmu Lin.</p><p><em>An enemy?!</em></p><p>Eyes overflowing with a chilling light, Duanmu Lin immediately prepared to cast his special ability to kill the person after he had confirmed the man was neither of the Special Abilities Bureau nor Tang Xiu’s.</p><p>“No. Don’t attack! Same side!”</p><p>Guo Tao had been avoiding the experts from the Special Abilities Bureau and the Tang Sect after witnessing them killing the Darkwind members. He kept trying to search for Tang Xiu literally everywhere since he didn’t want these experts to wrongly take him as a target and kill him.</p><p>Duanmu Lin’s expression slightly shifted. He shot a cold stare at the man and chillingly said, “You said you’re on our side?”</p><p>“Senior, I’m Guo Tang, the man Boss Tang planted,” Guo Tao quickly replied. “It was us who put the drug into the dishes for the Darkwind members, thus causing them into such condition. You can find Boss Tang and ask him if you don’t believe me.”</p><p>Eyes narrowed, Duanmu Lin actually believed Guo Tao upon hearing his explanation. But he chose to play safe and called Tang Xiu. Only after the latter’s confirmation then did he nod with satisfaction, saying, “For being able to read the circumstances and act accordingly, you’re not bad. Alright, you can live longer by not working for the Darkwind. I’m going to reward you and Wen Feng on behalf of the state’s Special Abilities Bureau after this matter is over.”</p><p>Guo Tao felt a bit more at ease. “I never thought you were a member of the state’s Special Abilities Bureau, Senior. I and Wen Feng were forced and threatened by the Darkwind back in the past to work for them. But then again, as long as the state can catch this whole lot of people in one fell swoop, we’ll be able to live safely and never do anything for them.”</p><p>Duanmu Lin nodded. “That’s the correct decision. But tell me, where’s Wang Sheng?”</p><p>“I got no idea.” Guo Tao shook his head. “He had already disappeared when the banquet was halfway through. I’ve secretly sent my men to find him but to no avail.”</p><p>Duanmu Lin’s face slightly changed and he said in a heavy voice, “Find Wang Sheng’s trace! We can’t let him escape today no matter what.”</p><p>Guo Tao was perfectly aware of the reason why Duanmu Lin wanted to find Wang Sheng. The man held a list of the Darkwind members in China.</p><p>However, Wan Sheng’s nickname in the Darkwind organization was the most famous of all—”A Man of Myriad Faces”. Even though he appeared in front of everyone today, who could guarantee he was using his real face? Even if he had seen that man before and the face was of the same appearance, it was likely he just used his privilege to see his subordinates for this honor and then might change his appearance to another.</p><p>****</p><p>Within the space barrier.</p><p>Tang An was vigilantly observing the surroundings. Her eyes were fixed on Wang Sheng, who was now being protected by four burly middle-aged men. As of now, she just came out of the tunnel outside the Golden Coast club.</p><p>“Inform McAllen to take the list of the Darkwind members in China and immediately leave this country at once! Also, activate the alarm device and notify each of our members. Tell them to lay low and wait for the resurgence.”</p><p>Wang Sheng immediately issued an order in a heavy voice just as he took a seat on the car that had yet to be started.</p><p>However, there was no response from his adjutant who just similarly took a seat on the front seat. The man hadn’t even closed the door yet.</p><p>Wang Sheng frowned and was about to speak again when he saw the other confidante who just entered the driver’s seat suddenly shrink his eyes and look frightened.</p><p>“What the fuck is happening?!!” A bad premonition suddenly surging in his heart, Wang Sheng immediately asked aloud.</p><p>“He’s dead—”</p><p>The confidant in the driver’s seat hadn’t even finished his words when his neck was twisted. A gurgling voice came out of his throat and then he died.</p><p>The fear in Wang Sheng’s heart multiplied. The enemy was invisible, and it made him secretly desperate. He pushed the door lightning-fast and drew a ruby-inlaid dagger from his waist.</p><p>“Who is it?!!”</p><p>Vigilantly scanning around fast, Wang Sheng shouted loudly. His other two men also quickly came down from another car and quickly protected him.</p><p><em>Puff, puff…</em></p><p>An immortal sword suddenly emerged out of thin air. Giving no chance to Wang Sheng’s two men to react, it directly slit their throats and impaled their hearts before it disappeared again.</p><p><em>Internal energy?!!</em></p><p>Pupils shrunk, Wang Sheng’s feet moved as fast as lighting and instantly appeared three meters away and powerfully slashed the ruby-inlaid dagger at the air fluctuation he had perceived.</p><p><em>Slash…</em></p><p>A muffled slashing sound was heard and that immortal sword appeared again out of the blue and swept toward Wang Sheng’s waist. No matter how fast he was, the clothes on his waist were still cut and left a bleeding wound.</p><p>“FLAME!”</p><p>Wang Sheng opened his left palm and a blob of fire suddenly emerged. He highly focused his mental power to sense the fluctuation of that “internal energy” and prepared to attack at any time.</p><p>It was an invisible man! One he had never encountered. Even though he also had another identity as an ability user and had seen many types of abilities, this was his first time running into an expert so proficient in stealth.</p><p>“World of Sword—Sword Prison!</p><p>An ethereal sound passed into Wang Sheng’s ears from all directions, whereas a sword image appeared several meters mid-air. The sword image seemed to form an airtight cage that straightly covered Wang Sheng from head to toe, though its striking might was not that powerful.</p><p>“CHARGE!”</p><p>Wang Sheng didn’t retreat and dashed to the top unyieldingly. The fireball in his hand was blasted out and the sea of flames suddenly appeared out of nowhere and covered a dozen meters radius.</p><p>Tang An’s figure donning a black night suit and a bronze mask appeared out of thin air. There was no voice nor sound coming out of her mouth as she cast a seal to summon another type of flame in the midst of the sea of fire.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
