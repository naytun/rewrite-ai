Never did he dream that a small country like Japan boasted such an expert. Observing the strength of these few thousands of people, most of them had reached the Qi Refining Stage and many were on par with Foundation Establishment cultivators.</p><p>“Don’t tell me all the cultivators in Japan are coming here?”</p><p>Lips twitching a few times, Tang Xiu’s eyes fell on Tang An’s bronze mask.</p><p>“They look weird somehow, Grand Master.” Tang An shook her head. “Take a close look at their faces as well as their running trajectories.”</p><p><em>Something strange?</em></p><p>Tang Xiu was slightly stunned and then carefully observed the few thousands of experts running fast below. His mouth twitched again a few times as he indignantly hummed. ” <em>Hmph</em> . They’re genetic warriors! Most of these people have taken beast gene injection. Just look at their running posture which is similar to the beasts’. Goddammit. How come Japan is so abnormal and perverted, to think that someone transformed so many people like this?”</p><p>“Based on my understanding of the Japanese, the people of this country kind of divided into two contrasting types. One has a very proud character and the other has an inferiority complex. The proud ones are very arrogant and tend to stop at nothing, even resorting to brutal and cruel methods to pursue their purposes, whereas the latter is the timid kind, struggling to survive in society. But it is due to these circumstances that people with these two types of personality will likely be twisted should they find a chance like this. I can guarantee most of the Japanese will be willing to be injected with the genetic agent and become a powerful genetic warrior if it promises them formidable strength.”</p><p>A frosty light flashed in Tang Xiu’s eyes as he coldly hummed and said, ” <em>Hmph</em> . Human is human and ghosts, monsters, as well as demons are of their own kind. Those genetic warriors are neither. Only some brutal savages. I’ll make sure to get rid of these genetic warriors when I have the ability later!”</p><p>“I think these genetic warriors are Japanese, Grand Master. They are very likely here to deal with the Joyous Palace,” Tang An softly replied. “Besides, our chief purpose in coming to Japan is to help Kuwako become the most powerful person in Japan. The more either of them dies, the easier will it be for Kuwako to control this country in the future.”</p><p>Tang Xiu approvingly nodded and said, “True that. They are in a dog-eat-dog situation, so let’s just watch the fun. Nothing will affect us even if both sides perish.”</p><p>“But there’s something that will affect us, Grand Master.” Tang An interjected in a low voice all of a sudden.</p><p>“Huh? Something can affect us? What could it be?” asked Tang Xiu in surprise.</p><p>“That Joyous Palace Saintess mustn’t die, Grand Master,” Tang An replied in a whisper.</p><p>Tang Xiu slightly furrowed his brows and asked, “Why can’t she die, though? She may be a virgin and has some looks, yet she’s still one of Joyous Palace people. We may opt not to kill her and some others from the Joyous Palace, but those Buddhist Sect’s old monks in the mainland definitely will never let them go.”</p><p>“Didn’t you hear it too before, Grand Master?” Tang An argued back. “That saintess is a woman cauldron—a furnace. You can improve your cultivation if you take her body.”</p><p>“Cut the nonsense!” reproved Tang Xiu.</p><p>Tang An shook her head. “Grand Master, I can tell that these people’s strengths are on par with Nascent Soul experts, and can even contend with those at the Spirit Formation Stage. I suspect that Joyous Palace’s Master has even more profound cultivation and is much stronger. Why can’t you take the furnace that works even for that man? That female is just a tool, nothing more. It’s better to have your power leap further than giving her to others for cheap and let her die for nothing.”</p><p>“No can do.” Tang Xiu shook his head. “That’s what the demon is doing.”</p><p>“The action of cultivating a female furnace is already a demonic deed, but to you, it’s like some recycling process.” Tang An questioned his decision.</p><p>“You…”</p><p>Somehow, Tang Xiu couldn’t understand what kind of thoughts filled Tang An’s mind. People did say a woman’s heart was deep like the ocean. He truly couldn’t make head or tail of what Tang An just raised up.</p><p>However, all the confusion in his head was cleared away by her next statement.</p><p>“You indeed have very powerful strength, Grand Master. But you also know that going further in cultivation is more difficult. Your current strength should be at the Spirit Formation Stage, and even those at the same stage won’t be able to match you. Yet, I do think you must seize any opportunity for you to step further and break the shackle of this plane. Master told me that we have enemies in the Immortal World. We may be strong enough, but so are those enemies of ours. That’s why we must speed up our cultivation and cast away our slackness. It’s all the more reason that we must seize every opportunity before us. Even if…”</p><p>“Even if what?” Tang Xiu frowned.</p><p>“Even if your relationship with your other women end up sour and bitter,” said Tang An in a deep voice.</p><p>Tang Xiu deeply sighed and shook his head. “I can get where you’re coming from, An. I really do. But improving my power using this method is really something I can never do. We’re going to improve, and some means are just meant for us to use to achieve that. But resorting to this kind of demonic deed is a big no. You had better cast away such a thought. Besides, there are also some chances that this Saintess may have some uses for the Joyous Palace’s Master, but the same may not necessarily similar to me.”</p><p>“She’s great for every practitioner, Grand Master.” Tang An insisted. “I once read the description of this woman in the Classics Library Pavilion. She once roamed all over China for many years in the past and then obtained a number of ancient manuals, one of which was a scripture that wrote the Frost Buddhist Relic.”</p><p>“I told you to cast away this thought already, An,” Tang Xiu replied in a deep voice.</p><p>Tang An still wanted to argue back, but she eventually swallowed back her words upon seeing Tang Xiu’s sullen expression. But her stubborn eyes betrayed her and she seemed to have made her mind secretly.</p><p>Tang Xiu literally threw away the notion Tang An just told him. He had his bottom line. He may have used some means to achieve some purpose, but it never meant that he would resort to any means.</p><p>It was the code and it was his bottom line. Even if he could return to the peak stage of Supremacy directly after doing that, it was something he never wanted to do. Cultivation was not limited to one’s physique but also the heart. His cultivation later would definitely be affected if he committed the deeds just like what Tang An said.</p><p>Suddenly, his brows raised and he said in a low voice, “That was interesting. This Joyous Palace Saintess actually got incited by Ki Kitagawa.”</p><p>“She’s not stupid. She finally realized she has always been regarded as a tool.” Tang An nodded. “Though I pity her circumstances, she has no other option but to stand in the line of their ranks and fight side-by-side. She could have faced those three men who came later if she were to choose Ki Kitagawa.”</p><p>“You’ve been guessing it all the time?” asked Tang Xiu.</p><p>“Yeah. But guessing is just that, a guess,” replied Tang An. “There’s no point in it since I may lose face in front of you if I’m mistaken, Grand Master.”</p><p>Tang Xiu smiled lightly and said indifferently, “It’s fine with me if you don’t say it, but I’ll tell you mine. I need not guess. Once she has a choice, she may not choose the Joyous Palace nor Ki Kitagawa, but rather those Japanese genetic warriors.”</p><p>“That’s rather speculative on your part, Grand Master. Why do you think those people are not Kitagawa’s underlings? Can’t he just assemble such a force given his ability?”</p><p>“Well, it’s certain that he’s someone from a certain state agency in Japan,” replied Tang Xiu indifferently.</p><p>“Since he’s a Japanese and Joyous Palace Saintess chose to side with those genetic warriors, isn’t it the same as choosing Ki Kitagawa’s side?” pursued Tang An.</p><p>“Not really.” Tang Xiu shook his head. “If she’s really smart, and once she’s sure that Kitagawa is someone from the Japan authority, she’s very likely to immediately find a way to leave fast. Though it’s also certain that she may also think that even Kitagawa won’t be able to do nothing to her once she pledges her allegiance to Japan sincerely.”</p><p>“Isn’t it much better to give her one more choice, though?” Tang An asked.</p><p>“An, you had better not think of any foul ideas if you don’t want to harm me.” Tang Xiu squinted to her and lightly said, “Every decision I made has always been well thought out and I’ve analyzed the pros and cons. But…”</p><p>“But what, Grand Master?” Tang An’s expression slightly shifted and pursued hurriedly.</p><p>A smile sported on Tang Xiu’s face. “The BUT is, who could possibly live in this world without committing any mistakes? You can make mistakes, but you can redeem yourself and make it right afterward. That’s always the greatest and most important virtue one can have. Words have it that those who repent and absolve their sins could become Buddhas right away. Besides, those who are weak always have difficulties to decide their own course of life and oftentimes possibly get trapped within by something. There’s perhaps a chance for this Joyous Palace Saintess if she has Buddha in her heart. And that path is the Buddhist Sect in China.”</p><p><em>Entering the Buddhist school and becoming a nun?</em></p><p>Tang An’s expression slightly changed and she exerted more strength to her nails, piercing her palm.</p><p>The courtyard in the distance had been razed to the ground, even causing tens of houses in the surrounding to bear the brunt. Tens of families with over a hundred souls fell victim and died in their collapsed houses due to the intense battle.</p><p>Yin Buddha’s sharp eyes could easily notice those experts who came dashing fast. As someone who knew nearly everything about the Joyous Palace, he could instantly determine that these people were not on his side, which meant they were enemies.</p><p>“Please use the Soul Summoner Flute, Saintess!”</p><p>Joyous Palace Saintess, who just killed Ki Kitagawa’s subordinate, suddenly had a change in expression upon hearing the sudden exclamation from Yin Buddha. Her state of mind was rapidly changing. She even questioned her identity and status and thus, wanted to leave the Joyous Palace for some time. At least, she must find a peaceful place to reminisce about her past and think about it.</p><p>The present situation would give her an easy way to get out, but if the Joyous Palace were to summon all of its members in Kyoto, a more brutal war would definitely happen and it would be very hard for her to get away when there were so many disciples from the palace at that time.</p><p><em>What should I do?</em></p><p>She suddenly hesitated for a while as those countless thoughts filled her mind.</p><p>Yin Buddha immediately tensed up and looked restless upon finding that the Saintess didn’t carry out what he asked her to do. He may be powerful, but he must escape when facing thousands of enemies regardless.</p><p>“What are you still hesitating about, Saintess? This time it will be either us or they who die and decide who’s going to be the winner and loser!” Yin Buddha shouted.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
