It will take us a long time of training to even make a little progress given our current strength. Wanting us to be 10 times stronger is outright impossible!”</p><p>“Nothing is impossible to achieve in this world.” Tang Xiu sneered. “It only depends on whether you can afford the hard work. Tang 28, come over here!”</p><p>Tang 28, who had been following Tang Xiu but had never spoken, suddenly came to Tang Xiu’s side and respectfully said, “Sovereign.”</p><p>“Tell them, how old you are.” Tang Xiu nodded to him.</p><p>“Eight and a half,” answered Tang 28.</p><p>Looking back at the men, Tang Xiu spoke in a deep tone, “Did you guys hear it? He’s eight and a half years old now. How high do you think his level of strength is at his present age?”</p><p>Li Zaibiao squinted and observed Tang 28 and then blurted. “Even if he’s a martial art prodigy, I don’t think his actual strength is recognizable given his age. We are not your match, but he, <em>hehe</em> …”</p><p>“You’re actually laughing and looking down on him?” Tang Xiu sneered. “Tang 28, Captain Li has yet to display his ability. You should understand what to do.”</p><p>Tang 28 slightly nodded and pace forward several steps toward Li Zaibiao, saying, “Please enlighten me, Captain Li.”</p><p>Li Zaibiao was stunned, and the 79 security firm’s strongmen were similarly dumbfounded.</p><p>Even the sitting Ni Penggang and Ni Jie were struck dumb and tongue-tied at this moment, looking at Tang Xiu and Tang 28 in disbelief.</p><p>A spar? Was this some kind of joke? An eight-and-a-half-year-old child wanted to challenge Li Zaibiao? Did Tang Xiu lost his mind?</p><p>After Li Zaibiao could react, he angrily glared at Tang Xiu. “Are you insulting me, Tang Xiu?”</p><p>“Heh, you can take it as such if you want.” Tang Xiu sneered. “If anything, he has already challenged you. Are you afraid of this eight-and-a-half-year-old child, by chance?”</p><p>“You gotta teach him, Cap’!” Yang Hu yelled.</p><p>“Go get him, Cap’! They just wanna show off their superiority, so let them know you’re not weak!” Ah Lu also shouted.</p><p>“Yea! Fight him!”</p><p>“Spar him and teach him a lesson!”</p><p>“…”</p><p>Li Zaibiao was burning with anger, yet he smiled and gave Tang Xiu a thumbs up. “Great! I didn’t expect you to humiliate people just because you’re strong. You want me to spar with a child, then I’ll give it to you. Just you wait! You’ll see how you end up.”</p><p>“Have you forgotten what I just said, Captain Li?” Tang Xiu sneered. “Don’t talk too much about anything or you’ll be beaten, humiliated, and lose face yet again. It’s going to hurt this time.”</p><p>The man drew in a deep breath to control his emotions and then said to Tang 28, “I won’t hold back and be lenient since you’re the one who challenged me, Kid. It was your so-called Sovereign who said that we mustn’t take anyone lightly.”</p><p>“Coming at me with your 100% power is an honor to me.” Tang 28 expressionlessly said, “I’ll make sure not to injure you since you’re too weak and the Sovereign himself doesn’t want you to get injured. Alright, let’s start!”</p><p>” <em>Hmph</em> …”</p><p>If it wasn’t for the previous incident, Li Zaibiao wouldn’t have bothered to bicker with a kid, but he recalled Tang Xiu’s actions previously. He immediately cast away any careless thoughts and charged forward to kick Tang 28 without holding back.</p><p><em>Pa…</em></p><p>Tang 28 raised his little hand and straightly blocked Li Zaibiao’s kick. The latter felt like his foot had been hit by a hammer even though it was protected by his boot.</p><p>“You’re too weak to bring me any threat whatsoever. No wonder Sect Master felt bored and asked all of you to gang up on him.” Tang 28 looked at Li Zaibiao, whose face discolored. His small figure leaped up quickly and straightly delivered a kick to the man’s cheek.</p><p>That one kick only used 30% of his strength, yet Li Zaibiao was still sent flying for ten meters before slamming heavily on the wall.</p><p>“What?! Impossible!”</p><p>“I must be seeing things. Cap’ is…”</p><p>“What the hell is going on? How can that kid be so fast? And his power… even Cap’ himself was sent flying backward?! But it’s impossible to fly that far!”</p><p>“Did this kid begin practicing since he was still in his mother’s womb or something? Even if he did, there’s no way he can be this powerful, right?”</p><p>“I must be dreaming. Absolutely. What a fucking mess!”</p><p>“…”</p><p>Each and every one of the 79 security firm’s strongmen exclaimed. They were unable to believe what just happened as if it was the most unbelievable thing in the world.</p><p>“You guys feel shocked, huh?” Tang Xiu said lightly, “You think that it’s impossible for Tang 28 to have such a powerful strength since he’s only an eight and a half year kid, don’t you?”</p><p>Although they didn’t answer, their expressions betrayed their inner thoughts. It was indeed something they couldn’t believe.</p><p>“Then make them believe it, Tang 28!” Tang Xiu ordered.</p><p>“As you will it.”</p><p>The boy’s figure instantly turned into a blurry image. Successive sounds of crackling were heard and were particularly harsh. The 79 strongmen who had just crawled up from the floor for a short time kissed the floor again. The difference was that Tang 28’s blows were heavier than Tang Xiu’s as his control was not that good. The stalwart men who had been hit by Tang Xiu now didn’t have the strength to even crawl up from the floor. They could only curl up on the spot they got hit and wail pitifully.</p><p>Tang 28 then stood in the midst of these men and coldly said, “Sovereign has been educating you ever since he entered this place to make you learn the truth not to judge anyone by their appearance. And yet, you’re all too dull and too proud. This is the punishment you deserve.”</p><p><em>‘A punishment? That’s right. This is a punishment!’</em></p><p>Shame instantly filled everyone’s heart, including Li Zaibiao. They regretted their arrogance after Tang Xiu defeated them before, but getting defeated by Tang 28 this time felt like they were getting slapped on the face by invisible hands, causing a burning sense of shame and wishing they could drill a hole to hide, unwilling to face people anymore.</p><p>They had lost face. What a shame for making a fool of themselves!</p><p>Ni Penggang’s breath was rough and heavy. He stared at Tang 28 fixedly. Only now did he finally realize how terrifying a cultivator could be. Tang Xiu told him that he could become a Qi Refining Stage cultivator himself within three months—this fact now made him feel ecstatic.</p><p>“Tang Xiu, can I be more powerful than Tang 28 three months later if I practice diligently?” Ni Penggang couldn’t wait to ask.</p><p>Tang Xiu turned around and saw the anticipation on Ni Penggang’s face. He smilingly shook his head and said slowly, “Uncle Ni, Tang 28 is not weak. He’s a genius who stood out from the tens of thousands of children soldiers. Let alone cultivating for three months, you may not be able to reach his level even if you practice for three years. The cultivation path is a road one must slowly walk forward while gradually accumulating his cultivation.”</p><p>Ni Penggang’s pupils shrunk and felt disappointed. Just from his observation, Tang 28’s combat power really was too strong and no worse than Tang Xiu’s, though he wasn’t clear about the specific real strengths of these two people.</p><p>As he thought up to this point, he asked, “Anyhow, how much power did Tang 28 just use, Tang Xiu?”</p><p>“Tell him, Tang 28.” Tang Xiu smiled.</p><p>“Perhaps 30%, give or take,” answered Tang 28.</p><p>“Hiss…”</p><p>Ni Penggang couldn’t help but gasp some cold air. The way he looked at Tang 28 was like he was watching an alien. How old is this kid? An eight-and-a-half-year-old boy only used one-third of his strength, yet he just literally crushed all his brothers who had been hardened in many battles. That was… simply heaven-defying!</p><p>The 80 members of security firm finally who had been finally eased from the pain couldn’t help but shiver due to deep fear upon hearing Ni Penggang’s conversation with Tang Xiu and Tang 28. They couldn’t imagine the outcome of the battle should they run into such a fearsome enemy on the battlefield. They would absolutely die miserably!</p><p>Tang Xiu glanced at Tang Yunde and smiled, “You can have some talks with Uncle Ni if you like, Dad. The spars and testing are done already. Time is precious and I’m preparing to train them well after you’ve finished the discussion. I’ll work hard to make their strength to skyrocket rapidly.”</p><p>“Let me say a few words first!” Ni Penggang nodded and slowly said, “Brothers, most of you were not selected by Tang Yunde then. It was I who picked you, guys. But all of you are our brothers and genuinely our own people. I’ve made a decision with Tang Yunde to hand you over to Tang Xiu, so he can train you well and temper you more into elite cracks. Hence, you are to obey his commands from today onward and treat him as your highest commanding officer!”</p><p>“…”</p><p>The 80 men didn’t speak but a bit of anticipation could be seen on their faces. They clearly realized that if they opted to obey Tang Xiu’s commands, they would be able to get cultivation techniques from Tang Xiu and thus became formidable experts in the future. They wanted to be stronger and obtained power for one goal: Revenge!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
