The occasion that revealed each man’s true nature made him realize that he was still far worse than his own father—which was also the reason his father put down his guard when facing his brothers.</p><p>However, he still held his principle that no matter how good the brothers were, it was still less important than being formidable himself.</p><p>When he was plotted against back when in the Immortal World, he always thought those good friends of his were his true brothers, and yet, he ultimately found that it was all his wishful thinking.</p><p>Suddenly, his face slightly shifted and he quietly retreated outside the warehouse. As he appeared at the square outside, he glanced around a few times and asked lightly, “Why did you come here?”</p><p>“Grand Master.” Tang An’s figure didn’t appear, but her faint voice passed into Tang Xiu’s ear. “We just received the news that a group of foreigner experts is gathering at the Haidi private port in Yungang City. They are now occupying the site completely and nobody can get close to it. The info gathered by our intel department says there are nearly 100 people gathered there, and the number is still increasing.”</p><p>Tang Xiu frowned and asked, “Who’s the owner of that port?”</p><p>“Wen Feng. He’s a real estate developer in Yungang City and is also the richest man there,” said Tang An. “Our men have secretly investigated him and found some issues pertaining to him.”</p><p>“And those issues are?” continued Tang Xiu.</p><p>“Wen Feng spent his childhood as an orphan who lived in the orphanage before he was 12 years old,” said Tang An. “But there was a big fire in the orphanage later on and many staff and children were burned to death and many went missing. Wen Feng was one of the missing people, but he suddenly appeared in Yungang City when he turned 18 about 6 years after the incident. He entered the key school in Yungang City to study and took the CET (College Entrance Test) in his second year. He was admitted to the Northern Uni, but then gave up the opportunity to enroll and started his business in Yungang.</p><p>“After 21 years, he founded the Riverhill Group and became the richest man in Yungang with assets up to 10 billion yuan. This Riverhill Group is not only engaged in real estate development but also foreign trade business with a private port that can accommodate more than ten large cargo ships.”</p><p>“What I want to know is the issue on his identity,” asked Tang Xiu faintly.</p><p>“It’s all about his funds. Many of his funds came from abroad,” said Tang An. “Although the capital flows into China from his trade is very secretive, our men can track the capital flows from some countries abroad even though the respective officials in the country may not be able to get anything should they intentionally investigate him.”</p><p>Tang Xiu’s eyes lit up with surprise. What had Wen Feng experienced after missing for 6 years? If he got recruited and became a tentacle of some foreign power and then came back to China, he must have some targets, purposes, and schemes to be carried out.</p><p>“Have you found out his true identity and those who have rushed over there?”</p><p>“We haven’t gotten anything yet!” replied Tang An. “Their movement is erratic and they are drifting from place to place. Further, they’re very vigilant. Our intel operatives were nearly noticed by them even though they’ve been very careful. Additionally, some of our trusted clients have been found out just to track the capital flows from abroad to Wen Feng. If it wasn’t for our men stepping forward, it’s likely that the other party would have already found us.”</p><p>Tang Xiu squinted with countless thoughts churning in his mind. After the long silence, he slowly said, “We’ll head to Yungang tonight. Only the two of us. We’ll find out who these people are and which organization Wen Feng is affiliated to.”</p><p>“Understood!”</p><p>There was no other sound or movement after Tang An finished speaking.</p><p>Tang Xiu fell into his train of thought for a while before turning and walking toward the warehouse. As he came inside, he saw all those big men were training, whereas Li Zaibiao was chatting with his father and Ni Penggang.</p><p>“Hey, Xiu’er. Where did you just go?” Upon seeing Tang Xiu walking inside, Tang Yunde immediately waved and asked aloud.</p><p>“I just received a particular message, so I left for a while. Anyway, I’m glad you can meet with your old brothers, Dad.” Tang Xiu smiled.</p><p>“Yeah! I’m really happy to see these former brothers of mine.” Tang Yunde happily smiled. “Well, let me introduce you, Xiu’er. He’s Li Zaibiao, a once military genius who appeared in the army.”</p><p>“How do you do, Uncle Li.” Tang Xiu looked at Li Zaibiao and smilingly nodded.</p><p>The big man carefully examined Tang Xiu and shook his head. “The bones and body are too weak, and your scholarly aura is way too thick. You’ll need a strong force to become a real warrior. But your father is like the God of War to us in the past, so I think a tiger father won’t beget a dog son. You must be quite amazing in other respects, right?”</p><p>“…”</p><p>Tang Xiu’s eyes were filled with a strange expression, whereas Tang Yunde and Ni Penggang rolled their eyes, feeling amused by Li Zaibiao, who judged someone else from his appearance.</p><p>The man himself ignored everyone’s expression and went on, “But then again, what he said about the sandbag just now really interests me. Anyhow, can I have as much as I want if you really have good quality sandbags that can withstand my strength?”</p><p>Tang Xiu shot Tang Yunde an inquiring look.</p><p>Tang Yunde squinted and exchanged looks with Ni Penggang. He waved to Tang Xiu and smilingly said, “Well, since we’re ready to hand them over to you, just play with them however you like! But don’t go too far, though. You also know how expensive medical care is nowadays.”</p><p>Tang Xiu just smiled in response and looked at Li Zaibiao’s expression, smilingly said, “Uncle Li, you think my body and bones are too weak, don’t you? Do you feel I’m not suitable to spar with strong men with muscles just because I have a thick scholarly aura?”</p><p>Li Zaibiao frowned and hesitantly said, “Tang Xiu, I always said whatever I have in mind and your old man knows this too. Throwing dirt on you was never my intention. But, I really do feel that you’re too weak, so you must exercise hard in the future. You can come to us later if you like, and we can teach you some self-defense moves.”</p><p>“Hehehe!”</p><p>Tang Xiu walked toward the iron frame on the side. After taking off his jacket and putting it on the iron frame, he spoke aloud, “Everyone, pay attention! Your Captain Li thinks that I’m too weak and wants to teach me some self-defense moves. However, I’m not convinced by him even though I’m very young. That’s why I’m going to challenge Captain Li. If he can win against me, he can treat me like a rookie soldier who will come here to report to him every day to practice my self-defense moves!”</p><p>His loud voice spread throughout the warehouse in an instant. All the strong men training inside stopped one by one and gathered with bizarre expressions on their faces.</p><p><em>‘A challenge? He’s challenging the Unmovable Captain Li?!!’</em></p><p>The rest of the security company’s elites, 79 of them, looked at Tang Xiu as though he was a fool. They knew their Captain Li Zaibiao’s strength, who was definitely the strongest of them. There was once a martial art grandmaster expert who came here, and they watched as he was helplessly beaten by their captain.</p><p>“Isn’t he the son of our idol? How come he doesn’t inherit his father’s wisdom and wants to challenge our Cap’? Isn’t this looking for abuse?”</p><p>” <em>Alas</em> , I always thought a tiger father won’t ever beget a dog son. It never occurred to me this young man was this reckless, though. He didn’t ask anything about our Cap’s strength and straightly took off his coat to challenge him. We all know the Cap’s strength and that he won’t show any mercy even if he’s Brother Tang’s son. That young man is unlucky. He’s in for some hard time.”</p><p>“Yeah, being a man means one must have self-awareness, else he’ll meet his death very quickly. Yet, he’s challenging the Cap’, huh? Might as well find a T-Rex and challenge it directly.”</p><p>“Ah, that’s the youngsters nowadays for you! They are full of themselves and their impulse always fills their heads. Does he think the Cap’ will look at his father’s face and give him some slack in the sparring? That’s simply stupid!”</p><p>“Haih, forget it, guys. Don’t watch this show. It has no thrill nor suspense.”</p><p>“…”</p><p>With his sharp hearing, Tang Xiu could hear all their whispers and discussions. He slightly curled up his lips and the smile on his face turned a bit thicker.</p><p>As Li Zaibiao shot a calm look at Tang Xiu, he was full of disappointment inwardly. He had a vague hunch that his former Captain, Tang Yunde, and Ni Penggang wanted to hand over these brothers to this young man. He would obey it without a question if this young man had the abilities and skills. That was on the premise that he was smart even though his personal combat force was appalling. After all, it was the ability to command that was needed. So that they could charge forward and break through the enemy lines.</p><p>However, he was so arrogant and unexpectedly challenged him! That was simply stupid.</p><p>Li Zaibiao felt that Tang Xiu not only did not have much power, but even his brain was also not good. If he and his brothers were to be given to this boy, that would spell misfortune to them.</p><p>“Are you sure?”</p><p>The man looked at the smiling Tang Xiu. His tone carried out the bad taste he felt inside.</p><p>Being keenly aware of this man’s attitude didn’t make Tang Xiu flinch. He just ignored it and smilingly said, “Uncle Li, you also know a man’s words hold the weight of his dignity. I already said it, and I mean it. I heard you talking when I just came in, and I also saw you making the sandbag explode with your kick, so your strength is quite fearsome. However, I don’t think it’s necessary to look at others with such a narrow vision either. You’ll know after our sparring whether I have the strength or not.”</p><p>“You know, I’d definitely not hesitate to agree had it been someone else, even if the other party is some martial art grandmaster expert.” Li Zaibiao shook his head and said, “But you’re the Cap’s son. That makes me feel like a monk who sees Buddha’s face. That’s why I can’t just move and end up hurting you since Cap’ is the man I respect the most in my heart.”</p><p>The smile on Tang Xiu’s face disappeared. He slightly frowned and said, “You’re the Captain of this security team. You should know that you must never look down on your opponents, regardless of who they are, or your entire security team will suffer heavy losses.”</p><p>Li Zaibiao didn’t pay attention to Tang Xiu’s statement at all. It wasn’t that he didn’t understand this truth, but he felt Tang Xiu was like a martial artist, so he held not the slightest interest in complying and doing it. He then pointed to a young man nearby and said, “Hey, Yang Hu! You play with him. But don’t use any heavy blows, got it?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
