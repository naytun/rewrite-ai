Had he not done it, he wouldn’t have to leave the Golden Coast Club and thus, barring the possibility to be captured by Tang Xiu’s men, causing his life to be under his control.</p><p>At the end of the day, however, there was no medicine for regret in this world, so he could only suppress his unwillingness and respectfully inquire. “You haven’t yet said your conditions, Boss Tang.”</p><p>“My only condition is for you to keep following this Wei old freak. You are to give him my information and pretend that nothing happened. Afterward, you are to take this drug to the Golden Coast club and put it into the dishes before they feast.”</p><p>With that said, he took a porcelain bottle from the interspatial ring and threw it to Wen Feng. “The drug won’t kill them, it’ll only make them weak in a short time. When they eat the drugged meal, you are to immediately inform me and I’ll lead some people to kill all the members of Darkwind in the whole territory of China.”</p><p>“But Boss Tang, it will only spell doom for us if you kill all the Darkwind’s members in China,” Wen Feng blurted out in shock. “Are you perhaps still unaware of how strong the Darkwind organization is? The organization may hide in the dark, but its overall strength is by no means inferior to the world’s top three forces. The headquarter will definitely send elite warriors over here once all the members die, and they will investigate you for sure.”</p><p>“I’m confident that those people sent by the Darkwind won’t be able to investigate me. But even if they can, what can they do to me, huh?” Tang Xiu sneered. ” <em>Hmph</em> , if anything, if it wasn’t for my hands have been getting tied by many things, I’d have already destroyed the entire Darkwind organization—a cancer-like existence who has been keeping tabs on everyone’s private issues and selling them, huh?”</p><p>Wen Feng exchanged dismayed glances with Guo Tao yet again. Both of them had seen their share of arrogant people, but one with such a big mouth like Tang Xiu was unprecedented.</p><p><em>‘The ignorant fear nothing.’</em></p><p>The two men grunted this sentence inwardly a few times and couldn’t help but sigh secretly. They were well aware that they could only follow this man’s orders since their lives were under his control.</p><p>“We agree.”</p><p>Both men nodded without many words as Wen Feng carefully received the porcelain bottle.</p><p>A short while after both men had been taken away by Jin Shi, Tang Xiu then spoke to Chen Zhizhong, “There are still some problems with your body, so I won’t give you the commanding power I told you. You should go to sleep first. You should be able to remember a lot of things then. You don’t need to worry. I guarantee all your shrouded memories will all be back within 7 days.”</p><p>Chen Zhizhong silently knelt before Tang Xiu and kowtowed thrice. Then, he said, “Thank you, Master. I’ll always remember your kindness.”</p><p>“Spare me the kindness and virtue.” Tang Xiu waved and said, “You’re just my in-name disciple, but I’ll take you in as my true disciple if you can break through to the Spirit Formation Stage in a few years. Only then will I teach you more powerful cultivation arts as well as many immortal skills and secret arts.”</p><p><em>‘The Spirit Formation Stage?’</em></p><p>Chen Zhizhong gripped his fists and a resolute look glinted in his eyes as he replied in a deep tone, “I’m confident I can break through to the Spirit Formation Stage in the next few years, Master. Though I have no idea where that confidence comes from.”</p><p>Tang Xiu felt amused inwardly. Chen Zhizhong had obtained the inheritance of the Diablo Praecantator Clan, and thus, he was no longer what he used to be. Just his physique and constitution alone could be ranked at the top few among his disciples. If he couldn’t break through to the Spirit Formation Stage in a few years, there must be a problem!</p><p>Time fleeted by and the clock now pointed to 4 in the afternoon in the blink of an eye. As Tang Xiu sat cross-legged in the presidential suite of the hotel while silently absorbing the demonic energy contained in the Demon Core, the presidential suite’s door was knocked and Duanmu Lin’s voice was heard from the outside. “Tang Xiu, it’s me. Open the door.”</p><p>Tang Xiu floated up and instantly appeared before the door and opened it. He saw two men outside, Duanmu Lin and Zhu Long, and then gestured for them to come inside.</p><p>“How’s the current situation here, Tang Xiu?”</p><p>The Darkwind organization obviously gave quite a dread to Duanmu Lin given the expression on his face. He even seemed to want to eliminate it from China, looking impatient and just couldn’t wait to ask.</p><p>“My men have been monitoring the vicinity around the Golden Coast club,” Tang Xiu replied. “It’s been confirmed that the top executives of the Darkwind organization in the whole China have gathered there. And I believe we can take this chance to act if Senior Duanmu wants to remove this organization.”</p><p>Duanmu Lin’s eyes flashed with chilling lights as he asked in a deep tone, “How sure are you, exactly? 100%?”</p><p>“Although there are only about a dozen men of mine who have come to Liangang, I’m confident that none of those people can escape as long as the number of experts from your Special Abilities Bureau is more than ours,” replied Tang Xiu.</p><p>“Though we have been constantly killing the demonic beasts in the Himalayas, most of the experts of my agency are still there. I’ve only brought about 20 men here this time.” Duanmu Lin forced a smile. “But if you need it, I can mobilize the army to surround them. I’m sure the Darkwind’s intel operatives won’t be as powerful as cultivators, no?”</p><p>Tang Xiu was silent for a moment before waving. “The Darkwind has rooted deep in our country and they may have planted some people in the police force and the garrison of Liangang City. We can’t just mobilize the army that easily just to deal with them. Wait for some time. I’ve set some chess pieces in secret. If these guys can perform well, we’re going to have a total of nearly 40 men who can eliminate those people in the Golden Coast club.”</p><p>“Huh? What secret chess pieces?” asked Duanmu Lin hurriedly with a slightly shifted expression.</p><p>“It won’t be a surprise anymore if I disclose it now, don’t you think so Senior Duanmu?” Tang Xiu let out a mystifying smile and said, “Anyways, let’s just wait until we got the news from that side. Only then will we act.”</p><p>“Then what are we gonna do now? Just wait here?” asked Duanmu Lin.</p><p>“No, we’re moving in separate teams.” Tang Xiu shook his head and explained. “We’ll form some small teams and secretly sneak into the Golden Coast club, and then we’re to wait there until the time comes.”</p><p>“Alright, I’ll listen to you.” Duanmu Lin nodded.</p><p>They had cooperated many times and Duanmu Lin had absolute trust in Tang Xiu’s abilities. The results had been much to his satisfaction every time Tang Xiu was involved.</p><p>****</p><p>At the Golden Coast club.</p><p>In a large conference hall that was enough to accommodate thousands of people, hundreds of senior executives of China’s Darkwind branch took seats. Yet, the atmosphere of the entire hall was very strange. No one spoke and nobody moved around. Everyone just sat still quietly in their seats or shut their eyes, playing with their gadgets, while some others looked to be in a daze.</p><p><em>Pa…</em></p><p>The conference hall’s door was pushed hard and eight burly men in black suits and black sunglasses strode inside, garnering everyone’s attention.</p><p>A black-suited middle-aged man with long black hair but very plain face then stepped into the hall. His sharp eyes swept over the hundreds of people in the hall before he strode to the podium.</p><p>“Gentlemen, my name is Wang Sheng.”</p><p>A cold voice instantly spread to everyone’s eyes.</p><p><em>Buzz…</em></p><p>In that instant, hundreds of people abruptly got up and bowed to Wang Sheng. They all knew the name, but none of them had seen Wang Sheng in person. They all knew that this man was the general director of China’s Darkwind organization. A man with a detached and far-reaching position from the Darkwind’s HQ.</p><p>“Sit!”</p><p>Wang Sheng spoke this one word with a nod. A burly man then quickly moved a chair and placed it behind him.</p><p>Below the podium, Wen Feng was quietly observing Wang Sheng as it was his first time seeing this man. He was aware that some important things were to be announced since this great personage had come in person. Wang Sheng had never attended a meeting before, let alone been exposed to everyone.</p><p>“No matter what happens, I’m afraid the Darkwind will no longer exist in China after today.”</p><p>Wen Feng glanced to the left and found that Guo Tao was also looking and slightly nodding to him.</p><p>Wang Sheng’s eyes constantly move to the face of every member of the organization. After the brief opening speech, he straightly moved to the main topic. “All of you are the elites, and you’ve also contributed to the organization. You are all aware that the Darkwind has been hidden behind the scenes while monitoring the events around the world—all of which makes us the most mysterious existences in the eyes of many people in the world. However, the order I just received from the HQ states that the organization is going to announce and expose the armed forces we have to the public. By that time, we will make people around the world know that we’re the strongest force in the world!”</p><p><em>Going to the surface… as in, standing on the front stage?!!</em></p><p>Hundreds of people looked shocked by the news.</p><p>“As of recently, the Darkwind has been hit with heavy losses. Many forces believe that our organization is just a pure intelligence organization with no strong force to back us up. Hence, the Big Boss decided to stretch our muscles and make those who have been targeting us to put their claws away, or else it will be us who will cut their claws off!”</p><p>At this time, the eyes of Elder Wei, who stood at the front, lit up. He slowly stood up and said, “I’ve received an order from the organization too, Wang Sheng. But I think it’s a wrong decision to go against China at this time. The situation in this country is rather special, and we will be immediately suppressed by the state’s official forces once we do our show of force.”</p><p>“I’ve already reflected this situation as well.” Wang Sheng nodded. “That’s why the order from the HQ is still in accordance with the original order, added that we’re going to be given additional staff to set up a legal security company in China.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
