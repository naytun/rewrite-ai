He once sent his men to investigate Ni Jie, and naturally knew that Ni Penggang was a businessman. Only, he didn’t expect that the man had such a deep relationship with his father. As they headed to the warehouse, Tang Yunde spoke, “Penggang’s older brother was also a brother who braved dangers and death with me in the past, Son. But he met his death on the battlefield when he went to battle with House Dolan with me then. Penggang, however, retired early due to special reasons.”</p><p>Tang Xiu suddenly realized why the plan arranged his father in the past was still being implemented even though more than two decades had passed. It was because there were still people carrying it out.</p><p>A murderous glint flashed in Ni Penggang’s eyes, but he shook his head and said, “My brother raised me up, and we were both bound by a common destiny, facing weal and woe together. I didn’t expect him to leave so early, so I’ll make sure to obliterate House Dolan thoroughly. All their clansmen must die!”</p><p>Tang Xiu’s pace came to a halt as he watched Ni Penggang’s back. His figure suddenly flashed and appeared in front of him instantly. As he took out four silver needles from his interspatial ring, he instantly pierced his acupoints and, at the same time, grasped a sharp dagger and made a bleeding wound on the acupoint outside Ni Penggang’s lungs.</p><p>“Xiu’er!”</p><p>“Tang Xiu!!!”</p><p>Upon seeing Tang Xiu’s actions, Tang Yunde and Ni Jie’s complexions drastically changed and called out in alarm, whereas the men and women around looked grim and exchanged dismayed glances as they moved toward them.</p><p>Tang Xiu ignored his father and Ni Jie altogether. While looking at the pale-faced Ni Penggang, Tang Xiu said in a deep tone, “I already realized there are some problems with your body at first sight. The killing intent in you is too heavy, and it has affected the energy circulation in your heart and lungs. Although you can’t see anything, if this condition goes on, the killing intent, resentment, and other negative emotions caused by Yin energy will erode and damage your brain, and also cause your heart and lungs to fail and then lead you to die in pain.</p><p>“Now, sit cross-legged and do as I say.</p><p>“Please rest assured. You’re my father’s life-and-death brother and an elder I respect. I won’t harm you.”</p><p>Ni Penggang’s complexion quickly returned to normal after hearing this. He trusted Tang Yunde since he believed the man also harbored hatred towards House Dolan as deep as his. Therefore, he also trusted Tang Xiu since he was Tang Yunde’s son.</p><p>Sitting cross-legged, Ni Penggang silently closed his eyes.</p><p>“You must have been cultivating in Qigong, but the opened-up meridians are of Yin type, so your cultivation technique itself has a problem,” continued Tang Xiu in a deep voice. “It wouldn’t have been a problem if the one who cultivated it was a woman, but you’re a man with vigorous Yang energy, so practicing it became a big problem for you.</p><p>“Concentrate and calm your mind. Control the energy in your system and let it all flow toward the lungs and acupoints. I’ve already opened a hole there, and now is your turn to excrete all the Yin energy in your system.”</p><p>Ni Penggang suddenly opened his eyes and stared at Tang Xiu. “But forcing out all the Yin energy in my body is equal to discarding my cultivation, Nephew! I haven’t yet avenged the enmity, how can I become disabled?”</p><p>“Please trust me, Uncle Ni.” Tang Xiu shook his head. “I won’t let you become a waste, but will give you a huge benefit instead.”</p><p><em>‘Trust him? And it will be beneficial for me?’</em></p><p>After his complexion changed a few times, Ni Penggang only hesitated for less than three seconds before he shut his eyes and circulated the True Qi in his system to force out the Yin energy, forcing it to gather and flow to the lungs’ acupoints.</p><p><em>Puff…</em></p><p>Blood splattered and the temperature around Ni Penggang dropped several degrees in just half a minute. Tang Xiu himself wasn’t affected, but Tang Yunde and Ni Jie, who were very close to Ni Penggang, looked horrified and hurriedly retreated several steps.</p><p>They felt the change of temperature just now and the burst of strong negative emotions and killing urge in their hearts, even though the person they wanted to kill was not Ni Penggang. Yet, that burst of negative emotion still made them horrified regardless.</p><p>Time passed by and half an hour quickly fleeted by. Ni Penggang felt a sense of weakness. The True Qi he had painstakingly cultivated had been forced out and all the Yin energy in his system had been completely discharged.</p><p>Tang Xiu kept paying attention to Ni Penggang’s condition. After discovering his condition, he immediately pulled out four silver needless from his body and took out the medicinal ointment and applied it to the wound above his lungs. He then took out a medicinal pill and stuffed it into Ni Penggang’s mouth, saying, “Keep concentrating and refine your Qi. Sense the flow of qi in your body and then circulate it according to this cultivation route.”</p><p>Having said that, Tang Xiu held his wrist and checked his pulse while transferring a thread of his Primal Chaos energy into his body to quickly absorb the energy contained in the pill.</p><p>“Hmm…”</p><p>Opening up new meridians and acupoints was a joyous occasion for a cultivator, but Ni Penggang, who suffered a lot of pain, still made up his mind not to experience even one-tenth of this painful process ever again.</p><p>However, he still wanted to know how beneficial it was just like Tang Xiu said. Thus, he persevered and steeled himself from fainting because of pain.</p><p>This time, three hours passed by as Ni Penggang felt his brain was as though filled with roars. The pain in his body disappeared like a tide, replaced by a warm flow of energy that circulated throughout his system and gave birth to intense comfort.</p><p>It was so comfortable that he felt like he was soaking himself in warm water. He almost moaned due to the deep comfort.</p><p>Tang Xiu’s voice then sounded in his ear. “Memorize this circulation route of True Essence energy. Circulate your energy every day for at least 49 days. You can successfully embark on the cultivation path and become a Qi Refining Stage cultivator after three months.”</p><p><em>‘A cultivator at the Qi Refining Stage?’</em></p><p>Although Ni Penggang had no clue what this Qi Refining Stage meant, he knew the existence of cultivators—some god-like characters in his eyes, who possessed mysterious supernatural abilities and power that was enough to make countless people worship them.</p><p>Seeing the painful look on her father’s face disappear completely, Ni Jie’s restlessness finally eased down. She looked at Tang Xiu and asked, “H-how… is my father’s condition?”</p><p>“He’s doing great now. It can be said what happened to him was a blessing in disguise,” said Tang Xiu smilingly. “The erosion of Yin energy in his system has badly harmed his internal condition, but after it got discharged, it left behind True Essence energy after he cultivated in the cultivation technique I taught him. That’s because the constant erosion of his physique was like an unceasing tempering that makes his physical condition to be much better than the average people because of the nourishment of the True Essence energy.”</p><p>“I didn’t understand anything you said.” Ni Jie shook her head.</p><p>“It doesn’t matter if you don’t understand.” Tang Xiu smilingly replied, “You just need to know there’s no hidden danger left in your father’s body anymore. He’ll even be much better than before after he wakes up.”</p><p>Ni Jie’s lips squirmed a few times and she held some doubts over the statement. She had clearly seen Tang Xiu’s action. He used four silver needles to pierce her father’s body and even used a dagger to make a bleeding wound. How could it be possible that it was beneficial to him?</p><p>Night fell and the chilling stream of energy made Ni Jie, whose physique was frail, shiver and her face to go pale. Tang Xiu, who sat not far from her, shook his head secretly. He took his coat off and handed it to her, saying, “Wear this.”</p><p>Ni Jie took the jacket and nodded without a word.</p><p>Tang Xiu shifted his focus to Ni Penggang. As his body moved, he immediately said with a smile, “If my guess is correct, Uncle Ni should be waking up very soon.”</p><p>As he just said, Ni Penggang woke up from his cultivation as Tang Xiu’s voice dissipated. When his sight was restored, he saw Tang Yunde, Tang Xiu, his daughter Ni Jie, and the rest sitting in front of him. He directly jumped up from the ground and moved his arm and underbody. He sensed the strength contained in his body now, and the way he looked at Tang Xiu suddenly turned different.</p><p>“This is a very powerful strength,” murmured Ni Penggang, a bit excited.</p><p>“It was due to the Essence Amassing Pill, so of course, it will be greatly beneficial to you,” said Tang Xiu smilingly. “Do you remember what I said before? Keep circulating your True Essence energy for 49 days every day and do it according to this circulation route. Keep practicing it for at least three months.”</p><p>Ni Penggang firmly nodded. He then hesitated and inquired. “Tang Xiu, you told me that I can become a cultivator if I persist for three months. Is that right?”</p><p>“That’s correct.” Tang Xiu nodded. “The cultivation technique I taught you is one to reach immortality, though there are still the next contents to be taught. But I’ll impart you the whole set of this cultivation technique later, so it won’t be a problem for you to walk on the path of immortality in the future as long as you devote your time for cultivation well.”</p><p><em>‘Walking on the cultivation path and becoming an immortal?!’</em></p><p>Ni Penggang’s mouth twitched a few times and felt Tang Xiu was exaggerating a bit.</p><p>“You seem to be more fortunate than me, Penggang!” Tang Yunde chuckled and said, “Xiu’er had long taught me a cultivation technique too, but I haven’t yet succeeded in cultivating True Essence energy until now. Well, I took some good things too, quite a lot. But well, it was of no use.”</p><p>Ni Penggang’s eyes instantly shone. He excitedly looked at Tang Xiu and asked, “That reminds me of something, Nephew! You just said you gave me a medicinal pill, right? Your uncle is already old and it’s likely I won’t have an easy time in cultivation later. The progress speed of my cultivation can be faster with the help of these pills.”</p><p>Tang Xiu took a jade bottle from his interspatial ring and gave it to Ni Penggang while smiling. “There are ten Essence Amassing Pills here, but you mustn’t take it in the next three months. Cultivation is like constructing a building. If the foundation isn’t solid enough, it will be easy to encounter qi deviation symptoms in the future. You should also understand the principal truth that haste makes waste, Uncle Ni, so don’t take this pill in any situation and just continue to practice for the next three months. You can still easily suppress some martial arts grandmaster experts later even without taking it.”</p><p><em>‘I can easily suppress martial arts grandmaster level experts?’</em></p><p>Ni Penggang blinked and his heartbeat sped up a few times, asking, “You’re not lying to me, are you, Nephew?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
