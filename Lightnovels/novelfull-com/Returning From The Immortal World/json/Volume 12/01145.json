He was just shocked by Wen Liang’s strength, but then the “Captain” address came from his mouth made him feel terrible.</p><p><em>Who’s he? Who’s qualified to be this man’s captain given his strength?</em></p><p>He suddenly realized that he seemed to have fallen into a great whirlpool, wherein he would run into a meat grinder, or better yet, an opportunity. After seeing Wen Liang hang up the phone, he asked again, “Who exactly are you?”</p><p>“Who I am, huh?” Wen Liang smilingly said, “That’s not something you’re qualified to know. Someone will quickly come over to identify you. Just hope you got some good luck so you can keep your life, boy.”</p><p>Li Yuquan drew a deep breath and replied, “I always knew what kind of ending I’d face—it’s nothing but death. But can I ask you one thing before I die?”</p><p>“I know what you gotta ask me, but no, I’m sorry.” Wen Liang lightly shook his head. “I got my own duty, so I can’t save your family.”</p><p>In that instant, Li Yuquan’s face seemed to have lost the spirit to live, deep despair rising inside him. But he couldn’t accept it. Even if he couldn’t kill that bastard who kidnapped his wife and kid, he wanted his wife and child to be safe! Unwilling, he begged. “Please, we both were members of the Blue Eagle special force and you’re also my senior. I know it’s wrong to steal, but it’s not like I can really help it.”</p><p>“You shouldn’t have come here as it should’ve been very easy for you to get 2 million given your ability.” Wen Liang shook his head and said, “I just don’t get it. You’ve always stressed that you got no time left. What’s that for, though? Are you afraid that Chang Zhao will really kill one of your family members to make you pay the ransom?”</p><p>Li Yuquan let out a mirthless and miserable smile. “Chang Zhao won’t do so shortly since it’s been me who he wants to deal with. The reason why he wants 2 million is that he wants to destroy me mentally. When I stressed that I got no time is that there’s also another wrong deed I’ve done.”</p><p>“Did you murder someone?” asked Wen Liang with a faint smile.</p><p>“It’s more serious than that.” Li Yuquan shook his head.</p><p>With a surprised look, Wen Liang said, “Then tell me about it. If your reply can surprise, I can plead with the Cap’ for you. Maybe it will touch his kindness and he’ll just let you go.”</p><p>Li Yuquan’s eyes lit up before they dimmed again. Then, he shook his head and said, “I just can’t say it. Only a dead-end remains once I do. Senior Wen Liang, I rarely asked help from anyone in all my life, but please, I beg you to help me save my wife and kid. If the afterlife does really exist, I, Li Yuquan, will definitely repay your kindness.”</p><p>“I already told you that I’m bound with my own duty. I definitely got no time to help you save them.” Wen Liang shook his head. “But of course you can ask the Cap. I can move if he gives me permission.”</p><p>“Who’s your captain?” asked Li Yuquan hurriedly.</p><p>“His identity isn’t something you can know.” Wen Liang shook his head and said, “But I can give you advice, boy. Don’t ask any questions such as ‘who are you’ for it will not be beneficial for you and instead speed up your chance to meet your death.”</p><p><em>Is it some mysterious organization or something?</em></p><p>Li Yuquan suddenly realized the possibility of such a situation. His bright eyes when he looked at Wen Liang now turned completely different.</p><p>Twenty minutes later, the door was pushed open from the outside as a sturdy middle-aged man with a cold face came inside. His expression moved ever so slightly when he saw Li Yuquan inside.</p><p>“You…”</p><p>Li Yuquan’s pupils suddenly shrunk after seeing the man, looking horrified and panicked. He just couldn’t believe his eyes since the man was someone he had long thought to be dead. But now, he appeared before him in perfect condition. Moreover, he was also the man Wen Liang addressed as Cap.</p><p><em>This… what exactly is going on here? How did the former soul of the army and the once unshakable King of Soldiers appear here?</em></p><p>It was Lang Tou, nicknamed Wolf Head, who was summoned to China by the order to assist Jin Shi to establish the intelligence network in China. He squinted after seeing the tied-up Li Yuquan and glanced at We Liang. “You got me into some shit here.”</p><p>“Trouble? How come?” Wen Liang was confused.</p><p>Wolf Heald snorted coldly. “Hmph. He knows me, kind of way back then. Isn’t that right, Yuquan boy?”</p><p>Lips squirming, Li Yuquan tremblingly said, “Wolf… No, instructor, weren’t you killed in action when carrying out a mission abroad?”</p><p>“That’s only the statement from the army.” Wolf Head shook his head and said, “I’ve already left the army then, in fact. But… how did you come to be here?”</p><p>“He snuck in to steal some things, Cap’, and I caught him red-handed,” answered Wen Liang. “Anyhow, he’s your old acquaintance, so let me do the killings so as not to expose your identity. I’ll destroy his dead body and leave no trace.”</p><p>Wolf Head stopped him and incredulously looked at Li Yuquan. “You stealing? You rushed here just to steal things?”</p><p>“I’m in dire need of cash since my wife and kid are kidnapped. I need 2 million to get them back,” said Li Yuquan bitterly.</p><p>Wolf Head was silent for a moment and rubbed his temple, looking to have a bit of a headache. Absolute secrecy must be in place to keep his current identity, but he was now recognized by Li Yuquan. Unless he killed this fella, he really was at a loss for what to do.</p><p>Stealing was but a minor thing, as they could be dealt with as a lesson taught.</p><p>However, his identity was likely to be exposed should Li Yuquan be released; he didn’t want to see such an outcome. He even believed that it was not something Sect Master Tang Xiu wanted to see either.</p><p><em>Pa…</em></p><p>Wolf Head took out a cigarette and a lighter. A sharp dagger flashed and cut off the rope tying Li Yuquan. Afterward, he lit a cigarette and took a few deep puffs before saying, “I’m gonna call someone first.”</p><p>At the Blue Starfish Mansion.</p><p>Tang Xiu, who had just fallen asleep, was disturbed by the ringing of his mobile phone. He looked at the caller on the screen and picked up the call. “What’s up, Wolf Head?”</p><p>“I got a situation here, Sect Master. My identity just got discovered by an old acquaintance of mine.” Wolf Head’s forced amiable voice was heard from the phone.</p><p>“Do you even need to report this kind of thing to me? Just seal off his mouth directly like what you always do. If that’s no good, just remove him directly,” said Tang Xiu apathetically.</p><p>“Sect Master, he used to be my cadet in the army and a sharp soldier I looked after. I just can’t kill him even if I want to. Also, the situation is a bit special as he’s currently at our #06 God’s Nectar Store,” explained Wolf Head with a bitter voice.</p><p>“Huh? How did he get there?” asked Tang Xiu with furrowed brows.</p><p>“He came to steal things and got knocked out by Wen Liang on the spot,” said Wolf Head.</p><p>“Didn’t you tell he’s a great soldier in the army and someone you felt optimistic? Why is he stealing, and stealing <em>our</em> things in the first place?” asked Tang Xiu with a strange voice.</p><p>“Li Yuquan’s family members got kidnapped and he needs quite a sum of money for the ransom,” explained Wolf Head. “It’s kind of a coincidence that he came to steal from our store, really. How do you think we should solve this problem?”</p><p>Tang Xiu was silent for a moment and then slowly said, “You got two choices. First, you completely seal off his mouth, regardless of what method you use. Second, you’ll be grounded in the Nine Dragons Island and cannot leave for 10 years.”</p><p>Having said that, he directly hung up and looked a bit angry, throwing the phone onto the bedside and lying down again.</p><p>Suddenly, his expression slightly changed and a name emerged in his mind: Li Yuquan?</p><p>In that instant, he grabbed his phone again, dialed Wolf Head’s number, and quickly asked, “Wolf Head, what did you say the name of the man you just caught was?”</p><p>“Li Yuquan.”</p><p>Wolf Head was actually feeling bitter inwardly. At this moment when he was hesitating, Tang Xiu called him and he immediately answered his question respectfully.</p><p>“Li Yuquan? Once a soldier and just retired from the army this year?” Tang Xiu asked in a deep voice.</p><p>Wolf Head went into the room and asked Li Yuquan, and then answered, “That’s right. He just retired this year.”</p><p>“Ask him immediately if it was him who stole the Aeroglider from the army.” Tang Xiu ordered in a deep voice.</p><p>Wolf Head was unaware of what this Aeroglider was, but he still asked Li Yuquan as per his instructions. “Answer me a question. Were you the one who stole the Aeroglider from the army?”</p><p><em>The Aeroglider?</em></p><p>Li Yuquan was shaken and desperation filled his whole being. He knew that he had been completely exposed. His only hope was to ask Wolf Head to save his wife and child, so he nodded and said, “That’s right. I was the one who stole it and gave it to the Blue Starfish Mansion to auction.”</p><p>Tang Xiu could hear Li Yuquan’s answer through the phone. He suddenly felt somewhat at a loss whether he had to cry or laugh at this moment. Duanmu Lin went all out to search for Li Yuquan, yet he didn’t expect that the man actually fell into one of his men instead. The funniest thing was that he was arrested by his men for stealing the property of his God’s Nectar Store.</p><p><em>His family got kidnapped?</em></p><p>Tang Xiu thought for a moment while listening to Wolf Head’s report from the phone. Various thoughts filled his mind. He didn’t want to hand Li Yuquan over to Duanmu Lin directly. The latter had literally used too many channels just to arrest Li Yuquan, so if he were to find oud that he caught them ahead of time, Duanmu Lin would definitely suspect that his intel network had even exceeded that of the state’s intelligence agency.</p><p>Duanmu Lin himself wouldn’t press nor take him on due to being afraid of the consequence to some extent given his current power. But once the man realized that he had such a terrifying intel network, his wariness towards him would definitely soar and he would use all his resources and power to investigate his intel network just like he was treating the Darkwind Organization now. It was even likely that he would resort to some unwanted moves.</p><p>After a long while, Tang Xiu said in a deep voice, “Wolf Head, escort this Li Yuquan to the Bluestar Villa in secret. Bear in mind that all the intel operatives of the state in all of China are now searching for him. You must be sure to keep out of their radar!”</p><p>“Copy that!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
