Under the watchful eyes of Chang Zhao and the woman, Tang Xiu then leisurely followed.</p><p>The woman’s expression shifted. She had seen Li Yuquan’s photo and could recognize him at once, but she couldn’t tell who Wolf Head and Tang Xiu were.</p><p>“Who are you, people?”</p><p>She paced two steps forward and immediately asked indifferently upon seeing Tang Xiu, who she felt was rather extraordinary.</p><p>Tang Xiu just slightly glanced at her before his eyes immediately landed on Chang Zhao. He came to the guy’s side in a few steps and pushed him onto the sofa. Then, he lit a cigarette and lightly said, “Are you <em>that</em> Chang Zhao, huh?”</p><p>Chang Zhao himself thought that Tang Xiu somewhat looked familiar, but he couldn’t remember where he had seen him. But Tang Xiu’s push made him incensed and he coldly snorted. “Hmph, where the hell such hoodlum like you came from, huh? Do you wanna stand up for this surnamed Li or something?”</p><p>“You got that right. I’m gonna stand up for him.” Tang Xiu nodded. “People do say that worst luck may happen to one’s wife and children. I don’t care if you make things hard for Li Yuquan, but threatening him with his wife and kid is against the custom.”</p><p>“Heh, rules are set by the powerful.” Chang Zhao sneered. “Li Yuquan is nothing but a wretched worm—a chess piece that just got thrown away. Hey, Kiddo. I don’t give a damn who you are, but you had better poke your nose somewhere else and don’t meddle with my business, else you’ll end up more miserable than Li Yuquan!”</p><p>“Are you threatening me, by chance?”</p><p>Tang Xiu drew the smoke from the cigarette and sneered. “I could’ve killed you right here and now if you didn’t have a good uncle. Alright, I won’t bother myself bickering with you. Give me Li Yuquan’s wife and kid and I’ll forget this issue. But you can expect a heavy smack if you dare commit such a despicable thing again in the future.”</p><p>Squinting his eyes, Chang Zhao felt that this guy might be just trying to show off by coming here without much power to back him up. More so that he seemed to fear his uncle; such a thought made Chang Zhao furious. He turned around and walked to the opposite side of Tang Xiu, took sat on the sofa and raised his leg atop the other, sneering. “Hmph. You know my uncle, Boy? Then you must know that I’m not that easy to pick on. I’ll keep you accompany in whatever you wanna play with me!”</p><p>“Who the hell do you think you are?”</p><p>Tang Xiu looked at him like he was some kind of idiot. He shook his head and said, “I’ve read the information on your uncle, and he does have some minor abilities. But how can his relatives be so dumb?”</p><p>Chang Zhao’s face turned cold and he glowered. “Tell me that again? Who the f**k are you? How dare you judge my uncle?”</p><p><em>Pa…</em></p><p>Jin Shi strode forward and slapped the fella and dragged him off the sofa, beating him and then throwing him on the floor.</p><p>At this moment, four strong men rushed in from the outside. Seeing Chang Zhao being beaten, their complexions drastically changed and they stormed toward Chang Zao to help him up.</p><p>Chang Zhao covered his cheek but didn’t order his men to fight back. He knew Li Yuquan’s identity as the former captain of the Blue Eagle special force with remarkable skills. It was impossible for his four men to be his match at all. He knew that he had to be patient. Only when a large number of Sis Xue’s security guards came over would it be the time to retaliate.</p><p>While touching his cheek, Chang Zhao suddenly grinned and smiled. He turned to Jin Shi, gave him a thumbs-up and coldly spoke, “Someone hit me before and I got his arms cut off; another kicked me and I ordered my men to break their four limbs. This is not a threat, I’m telling you a fact. You dare to come here to make trouble, so I presume you got something that can back you up. Now I give you the chance to make a call and exhaust every means you can think of to everyone you can contact. I’m a schemer myself, but I’m not gonna play such a game now but accompany you to play openly!”</p><p>Tang Xiu was silent for a moment, then slowly said, “You’re Chang Guoxin’s nephew, so I’m giving you a good lesson today: when you’re facing enemies, be it them powerful hegemons or filthy ants, be very careful and investigate them first in detail, for you can never take any enemies lightly. You’ll win every battle if you know your enemy and yourself. But if you take them lightly, you’ll very likely drown and push yourself into the pit.”</p><p>“Heh, I don’t need you to give me a sermon!” Chang Zhao mocked.</p><p>Xue Zengmei, the female dressed in cheongsam, squirmed her sensual lips. Her eyes had been fixedly trained at Tang Xiu the moment he came into the room. She had been helping her father manage their security company secretly in recent years and spent a lot of time training security members. Therefore, she wasn’t very well-informed about the news outside as she oftentimes went away for several months and rarely had contact with the outside world. It was the chief reason why she was unable to recognize who this young man was.</p><p>Still, she was very confident in her ability to observe and judge people. Tang Xiu gave her a profound impression, yet it was like a superficial appearance regardless. However, she could sense an aura of someone from a high place from him through his every word and action, which made her secretly vigilant.</p><p>“Not bad.”</p><p>Xue Zengmei found Tang Xiu approvable and finally commented. Although they were in a hostile situation at the moment, appreciation could be seen in her eyes.</p><p>“You’re not average, Mister. May I know your name?”</p><p>Tang Xiu shot a glance at her again and indifferently replied, “Don’t tell me you don’t know what courtesy is. Why don’t you introduce yourself first before you ask others?”</p><p>Xue Zengmei’s expression slightly shifted, but she still answered nonetheless, “My name is Xue Zengmei. You can call me Proprietress Xue or Ms. Xue. I’m the owner of this teahouse.”</p><p>“You’re the owner of this place, yet you’re helping a hoodlum do his evil deeds here?” replied Tang Xiu apathetically. “You can close your teahouse from today onward!”</p><p>A cold light flashed in Xue Zengmei’s eyes and she faintly said, “Wanting me to shut this teahouse is possible, but do you have the power to make me afraid? Wouldn’t I be a laughingstock if I shut my teahouse down just because of your empty statements?”</p><p>Tang Xiu pointed to Chang Zhao and asked, “Your power, or rather, the power behind you, which one is stronger than his?”</p><p>After mulling over for a few seconds, Xue Zengmei slowly said, “There’s no choice between the two.”</p><p>“You said it’s fairly equal. Then, if I can make this brat kowtow and apologize like a slave, can you say that I have the ability to make you shut down this teahouse?”</p><p>“That’s right.”</p><p>Xue Zengmei was curious about Tang Xiu. She really wanted to see what this man could do. Could he really make Chang Zhao kowtow to him?</p><p>Tang Xiu took out his mobile phone and found Chang Guoxin’s cell number from the documents and dialed it afterward.</p><p>At the Southern Military Barracks.</p><p>Chang Guoxin had gotten up very early in the morning. Although he was now in a high position, he still maintained his exercising habit, so he still had a great physique. He had just finished his jogging and poured a glass of water when his phone on the table rang.</p><p>He had been in a good mood recently since he was able to finally topple his sworn enemy thanks to House Tang’s assistance. The news had even been passed down that he was very likely to go further. It must be noted that going higher was very difficult once one had achieved such a high position as him unless that person had support from a powerful backer. It was for this reason that he was getting closer to House Tang, and even dreading their power more.</p><p>He had even made up his mind to keep hugging this big tree tightly as it was very possible to add two more stars on his shoulder in the future.</p><p>“Who the heck is calling at this hour?”</p><p>Chang Guoxin grabbed the phone and saw the number displayed on the screen. It was an unfamiliar number, presumably from the Shanghai area, which made him immediately want to reject the call. But he thought that it could be from his cherished nephew who happened to be in Shanghai, so he hesitated. Finally, he picked it up and said, “Who is this?”</p><p>“I’m Tang Xiu from House Tang,” an indifferent voice replied from the phone.</p><p>Chang Guoxin was shaken inwardly and his eyes flickered. Although he was not a member of House Tang, he knew some facts about this family, especially the information on Tang Xiu. He was very clear that the aged patriarch of this house, Tang Guosheng, treated and fostered Tang Xiu as the heir and successor of the family. He even took this young man more seriously than his own three sons.</p><p>His expression instantly changed at this moment. Due to Tang Xiu likely being the Head of House Tang in the future, he replied very humbly, “I didn’t expect you to call me, Young Master Tang. May I know if there’s anything I can do for you?”</p><p>“Is Chang Zhao your nephew?” asked Tang Xiu lightly. “He has caused a lot of troubles and he only got two ways before him now.”</p><p>An earthquake shook Chang Guoxin’s heart and he hastily replied, “Did that Chang Zhao that bastard provoke you, Young Master Tang? If so, please rest assured. I’ll teach him a lesson to make a formal apology to you.”</p><p>“Provoking me is just a minor issue. But I’m going to give you your due respect and let this matter go this time,” said Tang Xiu faintly. “The person he has provoked is someone from the state’s Special Abilities Bureau. I’m sure these people are no stranger to you, no?”</p><p><em>GASP…</em></p><p>Chang Guoxin drew a cold breath and said in shock, “Young Master Tang, I do know some facts about the Special Abilities Bureau. They are a bunch of… terrifying ability users. But you mentioned about two options before. May I know which one can keep that good-for-nothing brat’s life?”</p><p>“The first one is to let those from the Special Abilities Bureau to investigate him and you can wait for him to be executed secretly,” said Tang Xiu lightly. “The second one is to send him to a military court which he’ll very likely be sentenced to death with a treason charge. No matter which one, these two roads before him will end up with his death. Certainly, I can also save his poor life, but he keeps yelling before my face, screaming arrogantly that he has an uncle who’s an army general. Now you tell me, do I need to use my means for such a brat?”</p><p>“The military court?” Chang Guoxing hurriedly replied, “How come there are other military courts? What exactly did he do, Young Master Tang? To think that…”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
