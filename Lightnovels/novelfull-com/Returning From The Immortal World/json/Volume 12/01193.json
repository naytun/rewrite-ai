Just forget it and don’t meddle on this one as it’s way too far. Besides, they are just insignificant nobodies and likely won’t get far. No matter how hard they secretly go against the sky, they’ll never be able to break through the shackles.”</p><p>“But…” The Caucasian man hesitated and argued. “We may be able to get some profits since that battle in Japan is a large-scale one!”</p><p>The old man gently raised his arm and suddenly, a torrential column of black mist hit the man. He then coldly snorted with a bit of killing intent in his voice. “You dare to disobey me?”</p><p>“I don’t dare!”</p><p>The Caucasian man was sent flying several meters backward and heavily slammed on the wall. He immediately got up and knelt before the old man and left quickly after knocking his head respectfully.</p><p>While looking at the back of the departed man, the contempt on the old man’s expression turned thicker. He indeed had issued the order to head over to any large-scale battle anywhere as they could then act to reap the benefits without much sweat after both sides mutually suffered heavy blows.</p><p>However, he had broken through <em>that</em> barrier and now possessed enormous power far from the imagination of any practitioner. Why would he bother about such profits anymore?</p><p>****</p><p>India, in the pyramid in the midst of a jungle.</p><p>A barefooted old man with a naked upper body and seemingly in the declining age moved his shaking legs as a strange expression painted his fully wrinkled face.</p><p>“Interesting! I never thought there were so many cultivators in Japan before. Judging from the course of the battle, those Buddhist cultivators should win, no? But… aren’t they from China’s Buddhist Sect? Don’t tell me… these Buddhist cultivators have fallen into the demonic path?!</p><p>“But the fight of these small fries has nothing to do with me no matter who they are. The most urgent thing for me now is to find that space channel early. I only have 120 years left to live. If I can’t find it and am unable to reach the realm where those Deities reside, it’s likely that I’ll vanish in this world.”</p><p>The barefooted old man’s body suddenly trembled and burst out a violent aura. His spiritual sense that covered the sky suddenly clashed with the other two spiritual senses.</p><p><em>Puah…</em></p><p>The old man spurted out a mouthful of blood crazily, but his trembling body instantly stood straight and shouted, “I’ll step on you both sooner or later, two old geezers!”</p><p>****</p><p>China.</p><p>In a certain part of the Qilian mountain range in Qinghai Province, an old lady in a linen coat and a headscarf was lying on a bamboo chair in the thatched cottage, while lines of energy flowing around her were constantly fluctuating.</p><p>Outside the thatched cottage, nine long-haired young girls in white dresses seemed to have sensed the energy fluctuation from the thatched cottage and came floating from afar and neatly stood in a row.</p><p>The figure of the linen-robed lady suddenly shook and she instantly stood straight. As she opened her arms, her thin fingers that were like the split image of dragon claws were exposed. A hoarse voice then came out of her mouth as she spoke. “This ancient one is only responsible for sheltering China and has nothing to do with the battle between those creatures in Japan. You can go there to meddle in if you see things that interest you. But remember, I’ll be waiting for you 13 years later in <em>that</em> Arctic glacier.”</p><p>Her words were clearly heard, be it by the black mist-shrouded old man in America or the other one under the pyramid.</p><p>In that instant, the other two spiritual senses retreated fast like a tidal wave.</p><p>The linen-robed old lay floated out the thatched cottage and looked up at Japan’s direction. A smile sketched on the corner of her mouth as she muttered, “It’s just unfortunate that you’re all still too young. You all may be talented and your cultivation speed is far above the average humans, yet it will be quite hard for you to break through the Crossing Tribulation Realm in 13 years later, nonetheless. But you’ve always wanted to roam around, so just do that!”</p><p>The moment after, she retracted back her spiritual sense and shifted her attention to the nine women standing in front, slowly saying, “Children, I’ve peeped into your colorful fate and destiny from the heaven ever since you were born. Although I wasn’t able to fully understand the former happenings in your past life, I think you’ll be brought by fate to him. He has been roaming around and made some achievements, so it’s time for you to leave.”</p><p>“Grandmother.”</p><p>The nine girls in white knelt with reluctance evident in their bright black eyes as translucent tears trickled down on their beautiful faces.</p><p>The old lady calmly continued, “The beginning and the end of karma is sometimes like dreams within dreams that lead to all cases. I’m not clear about your fate and neither can I scry into your sea of mind and that world covered by the darkness. That’s why you need to leave now and seek it for yourself now. Off you go, Children!”</p><p>The woman in the middle raised her arm to wipe the tears on her face and respectfully asked, “Where should we go to find him, Grandma?”</p><p>“I’ve never been able to divine him nor can I control the course of his fate. He’s in Japan now, but if my conjecture is correct, he’ll leave that place a few days later, so you all need to find him yourselves.” The old lady shook her head.</p><p>That girl then asked again, “Could you pinpoint us the range, Grandma?”</p><p>“As always, you’re the most high-spirited, Zhong Ling dear.” The old lady couldn’t help but chuckle and said, “You’ve been following this ancient one for decades and knows my temperament clearly. Alright, alright. It would be rather hard for you to wander around without a clear destination, so go to Star City! It’s the place where he was born and grew up. It’s his root, after all.”</p><p><em>Star City?</em></p><p>The nine girls etched the name and at the same time, kowtowed to the old lady and knocked their heads thrice.</p><p>“We’re leaving, Grandma.”</p><p>The nine girls spoke in unison with reminiscent eyes and reluctance on their faces. While harboring these feelings, they flew southward to the southern side of Qilian Mountain to the small Qilian County.</p><p>****</p><p>Back to Japan.</p><p>At the summit of the mountain, Tang Xiu was still standing atop the pine tree with a tense feeling. He could sense those three super-powerful spiritual senses. He could even tell the position of the three people who transmitted their perceptions to this place. They were absolutely not in Japan but from some faraway countries.</p><p><em>These spiritual senses are neither Ji Chimei’s or Yan’er’s.</em></p><p>He was very familiar with their spiritual senses, so he was sure now that there were also three more super-powerful experts on Earth aside from Ji Chimei and Gu Yan’er. It was very likely that their cultivation level was far beyond the Spirit Formation Stage.</p><p><em>Who exactly are they?</em></p><p>Tang Xiu originally decided to carry out major actions to begin gathering cultivation resources on Earth extensively. It wasn’t only to strengthen himself but also for those tens of thousands of people under him. But he instantly changed his decision due to the emergence of these three divine senses.</p><p>Staying low-key and forbearance were a must before he could figure out the owners of those three divine senses. He couldn’t just easily expose himself for it would be inviting troublesome issues otherwise.</p><p>His attention then shifted to the battle scene that was getting bloodier and more brutal. He no longer gave it more attention as he was eager to find out from where and who had sent those three divine senses were. Therefore, after watching the battle, he floated down and unleashed a strike with his sword. The sword beam slashed down like a lightning bolt and split the pine tree into halves as the felled tree fell next to its trunk.</p><p>Time passed and the intense battle on this mountain peak between the Joyous Palace and the Gene Camp had lasted for three hours, resulting in dreadful destruction to the surroundings. The battle of these thousands of people itself kept sending a number of souls to depart this world in nearly each second and dying this part of mountain peak red with their blood.</p><p>“Keep slaughtering them!”</p><p>Dragon Vanquisher Sage’s eyes had practically turned bloodshot due to the killings. In these three hours, he had killed at least 500 genetic warriors and severely injured tens of cultivators, as well as clashed with General Fukuda several times. He did gain the upper hands every time they clashed and was able to injure General Fukuda, yet he had no means to kill him.</p><p>Suddenly, he noticed that General Fukuda was rushing at him again and crazily brandished his long spear at him. It took only the blink of an eye for the man to dash and appear right before his eyes.</p><p>“You court your death, Fukuda geezer!”</p><p>Dragon Vanquisher Sage furiously roared and instantly blasted out the monk staff in his hand. In that instant, it clashed with the long spear for hundreds of times in but a moment. Right as he was able to suppress General Fukuda, his eyes suddenly caught a dazzling ray that kept enlarging and eventually forming a sword tip in a hundredth of a second.</p><p>“DAMMIT!”</p><p>Dragon Vanquisher Sage’s expression enormously changed and instantly avoided the surprise strike of that particular sword. But the moment after, General Fukuda’s long spear struck his back and tore open a bleeding wound on it. Right as he blasted out his power, however, the owner of that sword appeared like a shadow in his left rear.</p><p><em>Puff…</em></p><p>The sword stabbed the monk’s left arm, but the middle-aged man in a black suit was also hit by several silver needles flicked by Dragon Vanquisher Sage.</p><p>The man also lost his eyes and another silver needle pierced through his throat.</p><p>Dragon Vanquisher Sage suppressed the pain from his wound and slammed his staff to the man’s chest the moment he screamed and tried to retreat, causing him to spray out a mouthful of blood. His body was sent flying backward as he heavily fell on the ground and died.</p><p>“DAMN YOU!”</p><p>It was now General Fukuda who flew into a rage. He instantly took out a tube of dark blue gene agent, pulled the cork and drank it.</p><p><em>ROAR…</em></p><p>In just a few seconds, the General’s body suddenly enlarged and transformed. His original 1.85m height now turned to 1.9m, while his muscles, in particular, looked a bit thinner but, nonetheless, made him look extraordinarily strong and sturdy.</p><p>“Psycho Demon Spear!”</p><p>The long spear in his hand bolted away instantly and created layers of spear shadows which seeemingly moved chaotically, yet tightly sealed the surrounding area mid-air.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
