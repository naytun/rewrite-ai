A winding pathway was as though having no end while the towering palace atop the summit exuded a simple and vicissitude of time and life.</p><p><em>DING…</em></p><p>The melodious bell echoed over the mountains at this time, disturbing the peace of wild animals in tens of kilometers in the surroundings and causing them to look toward the palace direction at the highest peak.</p><p>With a sword sheathed on his back, Miao Wentang tracked along the seemingly endless winding mountain pathway, but the little monk dressed in Kasaya suit turned his head to glance at him from time to time with a look of curiosity on his face.</p><p>It was rather unlikely for any guest to visit this Buddhist sect, to begin with. The little monk had been living here for 2 years, yet it was his first time seeing a cultivator pay homage to this mountain.</p><p>Quickly after, the duo came to the palace at the summit. Miao Wentang didn’t spare any time to enjoy the beautiful scenery around him. He didn’t even glance at the lingering clouds in the surrounding and shifted his focus right on the four Kasaya-suited elder monks with sticks in their hands and benevolent eyes.</p><p>“Amitabha, it’s a blessing for my Buddhist monastery that Benefactor Miao has come from afar. May I know Benefactor Miao’s purpose in visiting our monastery?” the old man in Kasaya asked with a smile.</p><p>Miao Wentang saluted by joining both palms and said after the ceremony, “It’s been some time since our last meeting in the Himalayas, Grand Abbot Bright Crane. My visit is due to the plea of a friend of mine. I’m just his messenger.”</p><p>“Which friend is it?” asked Grand Abbot Bright Crane curiously. “And what is the message content exactly?”</p><p>“It’s from Tang Xiu,” answered Miao Wentang.</p><p>Grand Abbot Bright Crane’s expression changed and looked surprised, saying, “Ah, it turns out to be from Benefactor Tang, someone who’s a dragon among men. I was stationed to guard the western line in the Himalayas back then, but I met him a few times nonetheless. It can be said China can stay stable and peaceful mainly due to his merits.”</p><p>Smilingly nodded in approval, Miao Wentang said, “Anyway, Tang Xiu asked me to come to the Buddhist sect in person to tell you that he’s now in Japan and has found some remnants of the Joyous Sect. They have now become the biggest and most mysterious force there after years of development.”</p><p>“Joyous splinter sect?”</p><p>Grand Abbot Bright Crane and the other three Buddhist Sect elders had a drastic change in expression. The four exchanged glances and the former said in a deep voice, “The Joyous Sect is one of the Tantric Buddhist schools, yet it has violated the Buddha’s way and has committed enormous sins and thus, can no longer be tolerated by our sect, resulting in the extermination of their group. Little did we expect that some of those scourges survived to this day. Benefactor Miao, this is a very important issue for us. Could you tell us where is Benefactor Tang now and how can we get in touch with him?”</p><p>Miao Wentang gave him Tang Xiu’s cell number and then said, “Tang Xiu also asked me to convey another message. If Grand Abbot of Buddhist Sect wants to clean up the school, the Buddhist Sect can call him in advance as he’s now in Kyoto and is waiting for your honorable arrival.”</p><p>“We are deeply grateful for this news Benefactor Miao.” Grand Abbot Bright Crane replied in a deep voice, “Our Buddhist sect, however, needs to take some time to discuss this utmost important issue at hand. Also, I’d like to ask Benefactor Miao to stay for some time. You can leave the Shaoshi Mountain later with my Buddhist disciples.”</p><p>“Alright.” Miao Wentang nodded.</p><p>Two hours later, eight Section Heads of the Buddhist Sect rushed from each stationery peak and entered a meditation hall. Nine people, including Grand Abbot Bright Crane, waited cross-legged on a futon inside.</p><p>“You gathered us all eight together at the same time, what exactly happened, Senior Brother Bright Crane?” a fat monk with a bright face and smooth skin asked curiously.</p><p>The rest didn’t ask, but they had similar curious expressions on their faces, their eyes fixed on Grand Abbot Bright Crane’s face.</p><p>“Some of you have seen Benefactor Tang Xiu and some have heard of him. I believe you have some understanding pertaining to his character,” said Grand Abbot Bright Crane slowly.</p><p>The fat monk nodded firmly. “Benefactor Tang Xiu has a Buddha heart although he’s not one of us. Everyone in the cultivation world holds him in respect today. Even this poor monk who has been cultivation for 3 centuries feels the same way.”</p><p>Another one, a slim and dark-skinned monk followed. “Back in the Himalayas, Benefactor Tang risked his life and braved death to slaughter a large number of demonic beasts and saved a lot of souls. This Black Face Buddha truly admires him for taking that action at the moment a crisis was to befall our race.”</p><p>“I also trust Benefactor Tang, Senior Brother Bright Crane.”</p><p>“Well, I haven’t met him, but I’ve heard of him. It’s true that hearing and seeing in person is the truth, but I believe the judgment of my elder martial brothers that Benefactor Tang is a just person.”</p><p>“I concur.”</p><p>“…”</p><p>After quietly listened to their opinions, Grand Abbot Bright Crane nodded and said, “Since we all trust Benefactor Tang, then I’ll tell you the reason for summoning you here. Benefactor Tang asked Benefactor Miao to come to our monastery and convey to us that the surviving remnants of Joyous Sect have moved to Japan and created a very large force.”</p><p>“That Joyous splinter group?!”</p><p>“Haven’t we completely destroyed those ravisher scums of the Joyous Sect in the past already? How come some of them survived?”</p><p>“Those scourges from the Joyous Sect? Some of those demons survived? Who are they?”</p><p>“If the news is true, then we must find and kill them!”</p><p>“Let’s get rid of evil for the people!”</p><p>“Let’s clean up our school!”</p><p>“…”</p><p>Grand Abbot Bright Crane raised his hands and said, “Junior Brothers, our Buddhist school has long decreed that no one from the Joyous Sect can ever exist anymore. Master also made a vow that none of those demons of the Joyous Sect can become a scourge for women anymore. And thus, now that we know about them we must exterminate them.</p><p>“I gather you all here is to discuss some issues. Who will lead the team to Japan and how many disciples are we going to take there?”</p><p>The Black Face Buddha spoke in a deep voice, “Amitabha, this duty of cleaning up our school is a great service to the people, so let this poor monk take the duty! Meting out punishment for the remaining evil elements is our religious commandment, to begin with.”</p><p>The fat monk pressed the beads with his thumb and smilingly said, “Junior and Senior Brothers, this one also has once infiltrated the Joyous Sect for secret investigation then. I understand the sinful crimes they’ve committed and also secretly gathered a list of their disciples. This one can say to be the one who’s the most familiar with the Joyous Sect, so this one must be included in the campaign to Japan to see who the surviving evil is!”</p><p>Grand Abbot Bright Crane nodded and slowly raised his hand to stop the rest who also wanted to talk. “I hereby decide that the campaign will be carried out by Junior Brother Black Face and Jade Buddha, while each of the Peak Monasteries will send two of your Junior Brothers. So, eighteen of you must make sure to get rid of those Joyous Sect’s remnants.”</p><p>Black Face Buddha and Jade Buddha, as well as the other six High Abbots, exchanged glances in surprise. Two juniors from each peak monastery as mentioned by Grand Abbot Bright Crane had a very high status and were also very formidable. The weakest one among them was on par with Golden Core cultivators.</p><p>As dusk arrived, Miao Wentang and 18 High Monks left the Shaoshi Mountain and Miao Wentang took care of everything to send them to Japan by plane.</p><p>Afterward, however, an incident happened since these High Monks rarely left the Shaoshi Mountain and so, had no ID card. Thus, the plan to ride a plane to Japan was ruined.</p><p>****</p><p>Japan, the Inada Society.</p><p>Tang Xiu leisurely sat by the window on the second floor of the attic while enjoying and appreciating the beautiful scenery in the surroundings. The dead bodies in the venue had all been taken care of and any traces of blood had been cleaned up as well. At the same time, Kuwako’s subordinates were also repairing the broken things due to the fight before.</p><p>Fragrant tea and beautiful view. And next to him was also an exquisite and classical beauty in the form of Kuwako who served him tea. All in all, it made everything feel comfortable to Tang Xiu. He happily downed the fragrant tea completely and then slowly asked, “Have those men sent anything about the information I asked them?”</p><p>“Not yet.” Kuwako shook her head. “But our men are still keeping tabs on those three, and it may not take long before we can find out their identity. All the information will be delivered to you by then.”</p><p>“You’re truly capable, Kuwako.” Tang Xiu nodded smilingly. “Also, it seems the decision to make you stay in Japan before was correct. Japan may look like a small place, but it has a large population and thus provides crises and opportunities at the same time. You’ve collected a massive amount of cultivation resources for the sect. That’s a great contribution. You can speed up your pace after we’ve dealt with this incident! Also, once you’re in control of Japan, you can return to Nine Dragons Island to cultivate and rise to a higher level.”</p><p>“I’m certain I can have Japan under my control in 3 years max as long as the Miyaji of Joyous Palace is destroyed, Sect Master.” Kuwako respectfully replied.</p><p>“You deal with the schedule, but don’t delay the plan for collecting cultivation resources. Also, Jin Shi will send some intel operatives in about half a year to set up our intel network in Japan. Sum up the intel you’ve gathered and relinquished its control to Jin Shi at that time.”</p><p>Kuwako thought about it and then said, “Would you like me to set up the intel network in Japan myself and then hand it over to Jin Shi or the man he sent here later?”</p><p>“Building an intel network is not something you can accomplish in a matter of a day.” Tang Xiu shook his head. “Also, the person in charge of this department has undying loyalty to Tang Sect and not the slightest mistake is acceptable. You can involve yourself in it if you want, but don’t put too much of your energy since your top priority is to control more influential people and forces here. Be it those from the military, politics, and business, you must have them under control for me. Do remember my rules of conduct: submit and you thrive, oppose and you can perish.”</p><p>Kuwako’s face shifted with approval and said with a look of respect, “I understand.”</p><p>Suddenly, her expression shifted and she dashed to the door. As opened the door from the inside and looked at the burly man in a black night suit, she asked in a deep voice, “Have you brought the information?”</p><p>“Yes,” replied the big man respectfully.</p><p>After Kuwako received it, she waved to hint the man to retreat. Then, she took the documents to Tang Xiu.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
