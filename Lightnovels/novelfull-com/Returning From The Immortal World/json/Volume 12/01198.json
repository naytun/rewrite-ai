Ever since he landed here, he was keenly aware that the concentration of the world’s energy in this place was several times stronger than that of Kyoto.</p><p>And… it wasn’t due to an array! It was caused by a small spiritual vein deep under the isolated island that connected to the deep ocean floor. However, something made him curious. Someone, apparently a powerful expert with astonishing magical power, had sealed it off to only spread out for about tens of kilometers radius at most This isolated island could have been transformed into a paradise on earth otherwise.</p><p><em>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</em></p><p>A group of moving figures flickered fast from afar and quickly appeared in front of Tang Xiu. The excited-looking Mo Awu, Tang Guang, Kuwako Yamamato, Hei Xiong, and Xue Sha… everyone was focusing on Tang Xiu.</p><p>The harvest they just obtained was great.</p><p>Even the invisible Tang An was also wearing a beaming face. What she obtained was even more than Mo Awu and the rest, and she stuffed all those valuable stuff into the interspatial ring Tang Xiu bestowed her.</p><p>“Where’s Gong Wan’er?”</p><p>Finally, Tang Xiu took back the vision that set to the distance and shifted to the crowd in front of him.</p><p>“She left with Kitagawa and hasn’t returned yet,” answered Kuwako.</p><p>Tang Xiu frowned and slowly said, “We’ll wait for another half an hour. But if they still don’t come back in time, we won’t wait for them any longer.”</p><p>20 minutes later.</p><p>Two fast-moving figures bolted from afar and soon appeared in front of Tang Xiu and the rest. The two people who returned this time brought two big black suitcases each. It was evident that they were carrying heavy objects given how they put those suitcases on the ground.</p><p>“Where did you just head to?” asked Tang Xiu lightly after carefully observing them.</p><p>Kitagawa angrily glared at Gong Wan’er before he cupped his fists and replied immediately, “We went to the Gene Camp’s stronghold, Boss!”</p><p>“What for?” asked Tang Xiu with a frown.</p><p>“General Fukuda has been operating in Japan for centuries, so we thought that he definitely hoarded a lot of treasures there,” answered Kitagawa. “That’s why I headed there with Gong Wan’er. We also exterminated the remaining genetic warriors those Buddhist Sect’s monks have missed, and sneaked into the stronghold and found the Gene Camp’s secret vault. The things in these four suitcases were taken from the Gene Camp’s treasure vault and many more things are still on the shore.”</p><p>Tang Xiu’s brows raised and he ordered. “Open them.”</p><p>Immediately, the four big black suitcases were opened and a surprised expression appeared in Tang Xiu’s eyes. There was no gold or silver in those suitcases, three of which contained some precious jewelry, jade, some antique paintings, and calligraphies. But the last one was full of precious herbs even to Tang Xiu.</p><p>“Well done.”</p><p>Tang Xiu waved and all the objects in the four suitcases flew up and quickly entered his interspatial ring. Then, he took out two jade bottles and threw them to Kitagawa and Gong Wan’er, speaking to them lightly, “You’ve made a contribution, and these pills are your rewards. Wait until I’ve sorted everything up and I’ll bestow you another great fortune.”</p><p>Some great fortune?</p><p>Kitagawa exchanged glances with Gong Wan’er. But when he was about to leave to take the rest of the loot, the latter suddenly said, “Boss, will Kitagawa be punished if I report what he did?”</p><p>Tang Xiu squinted and asked, “What exactly do you want to report?”</p><p>Kitagawa’s expression enormously changed and shouted fiercely, “Cut the crap, Gong Wan’er!”</p><p>Gong Wan’er took out a string of golden rope the size of a chopstick from her sleeve and said, “This is the treasure we obtained from the Gene Camp’s vault. I have no idea what this thing is. Also, Kitagawa kept the other one, but it’s a fist-sized metal ball which I have no idea what is it either.”</p><p>Kitagawa’s face changed dramatically and glared at her with hostility. Then, he spoke very unwillingly, “What I took from the Gene Camp’s vault was originally mine, Boss. It has a special meaning to me.”</p><p>“Just take it out,” said Tang Xiu.</p><p>Kitagawa shivered a bit and gritted his teeth as he took out the fist-sized metal ball from his sleeves. Then, he said, “This is it. It’s just a common thing.”</p><p>Tang Xiu’s eyes flickered as he noticed the small runes etched on the metal ball. A suction force suddenly shot from his palm and attracted the metal ball in Kitagawa’s hand. He then cast a secret art and applied it to the object, causing golden light to suddenly glow from the seal rune and gradually turn into a dazzling golden star.</p><p><em>Crack!</em></p><p>The metal ball suddenly split into eight petals and revealed a translucent pearl the size of a Ping-Pong ball to everyone present. The object may be a mystery to others, but he could clearly observe the image contained within the pearl: Frost Jellyfish.</p><p>The appearance of such an object on Earth was truly unexpected to Tang Xiu. It must be noted that the Frost Jellyfish was a great treasure even in the Immortal World, and many major forces there hoarded it as it could deepen their foundation.</p><p>“Do you really not know what this object is?” Tang Xiu shot a stare at Kitagawa and slowly asked.</p><p>Kitagawa felt like that Tang Xiu’s eyes seemed to be able to penetrate his mind. It made him hesitate, but he braced himself and spoke, “I know it. It’s a Dragon Pearl. General Fukuda himself said that this object is a Dragon Pearl when he was drunk. He said that this Dragon Pearl can make his cultivation greatly soar. I sneaked into his secret abode a few times, but I’ve never had the chance to steal it even though I found where it was hidden.”</p><p>“Idiot!”</p><p>Tang Xiu threw a contemptuous curse at him and indifferently said, “This is not Dragon Pearl but a carrier for Frost Jellyfish which can be greatly beneficial to any cultivator. Kitagawa, you can choose to leave this object to me, or exchange it with great fortune. Choose one. I want your reply now.”</p><p>Kitagawa himself wanted to take the object back. But after seeing Tang Xiu’s indifference, he had to endure that urge painfully and respectfully said, “I choose to exchange it with the good fortune, Boss.”</p><p>“Go and bring everything here!” Tang Xiu nodded and ordered. “All of you who are present will also get your share of good fortune later!”</p><p>Having said that, he quickly flew away to the distance fast. After spending 4 hours, he managed to lay out an array that covered the entire island—a type of array that was against the natural order which could completely ruin the geomatic formation of the targeted treasure land. It was because this array would sever the spiritual vein underneath and then extract it to strengthen himself.</p><p>“Sky Pilfering Array!”</p><p>This array was actually created by his disciple back when he was in the Immortal World. That disciple was a stunning cultivation genius and only spent three millenniums to reach the Golden Immortal Stage. He was just a hair away from reaching the Perfected Golden Immortal Stage then. But unfortunately, he finally ceased to develop further and died in the battle without any wisp of his soul remaining and vanished.</p><p>After returning to the square, Tang Xiu saw the addition of tens more people there. One of whom was a slightly hunchbacked middle-aged man and a group of young women in white.</p><p>“Who are they?” asked Tang Xiu with a frown.</p><p>Yuji paced a step forward and said, “They are my trusted maids.”</p><p>Kitagawa followed suit and said, “He’s Jun Yuchu, my trusted aide.”</p><p>Tang Xiu slightly furrowed his brows and indifferently said, “They are no longer your maids and aides from now on! The sixteen of you, listen! You all now have two choices: To stay on this isolated island forever and be barred from leaving, or becoming Kuwako Yamamoto’s subordinates and stay in Japan to manage things for her!”</p><p>Both Yuji and Kitagawa exchanged looks and indignant looks could be seen flashing in their eyes. But none of them dared to speak.</p><p>The 16 people shot dismayed looks at each other with hesitation evident on their faces, looking suddenly at a loss as to which one to choose. In actuality, they knew nothing about Tang Xiu. But they were all smart people and could see how respectful their Masters were in front of him, so they conjectured that he was the leader of this mysterious force.</p><p>Jun Yuchu came to Tang Xiu’s front and cupped his fists, saying, “About that… Sir. I’m Sir Kitagawa’s retainer since he’s the one who trained me. If he commands me to follow others, I naturally dare not refute. But everyone else… has no right to dictate my decision.”</p><p>“Is that so?”</p><p>A chilling light flashed in Tang Xiu’s eyes. A silver needle appeared in his fingertips and shot it at Jun Yuchu in just a hundredth of a second later. The needle moved extremely fast and struck Jun Yuchu’s Qi Ocean that even the man himself was unable to avoid or block it despite having formidable strength.</p><p><em>Puah…</em></p><p>Jun Yuchu was staggeringly forced to step back a few steps and covered his abdomen with disbelief overflowing in his eyes. He could clearly sense his power rapidly dissipating and no matter how hard he tried to seal it off, it was all for naught.</p><p>“How insolent you are. Your Master chose to submit to me, yet you dare to talk to me like that?” said Tang Xiu apathetically. “Don’t blame me for being this harsh since you don’t want to obey. You will stay on this island forever from now on!”</p><p>“You… you abolished my cultivation?”</p><p>Jun Yuchu shot a glare full of hatred towards Tang Xiu and seemingly couldn’t wait to kill him at once.</p><p>“I spared you on the account of Kitagawa’s face already. Scram away from me, else you can expect to become a corpse the next moment,” said Tang Xiu coldly.</p><p>“Jun, draw back!”</p><p>With some killing intent aimed at Tang Xiu, Kitagawa shouted. But he was perfectly aware of Tang Xiu’s strength and knew that he would never be able to injure Tang Xiu much even if he risked his life for it. Hence, he could only suppress his killing intent, for the time being, waiting for the day when he had freed himself from his clutches and make him at the border of life and death at that time.</p><p><em>Puff…</em></p><p>An immortal sword suddenly impaled Kitagawa from the back as Tang An’s figure suddenly appeared and kicked the man’s body. She sent it flying to heavily fall in front of Tang Xiu’s feet. Then, she coldly snorted. “Hmph, you dare to harbor killing intent against Grand Master? Your court death!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
