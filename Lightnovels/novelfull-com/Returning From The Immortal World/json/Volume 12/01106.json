He had been following Tang Xiu for some time and knew well some of Tang Xiu’s side. Although he didn’t know the specific reasons, the fact that the people of House Dolan were already sentenced to death was impossible to change. Therefore, even if Angelo Dolan put out more than 1 billion dollars, it was unlikely he could change the outcome of his death.</p><p>“Online wire transfer.”</p><p>He took out a laptop from his interspatial ring as he spoke to Angelo in a deep voice.</p><p>Seeing Mo Awu take out a laptop as if summoning it made Angelo shocked immediately. He carefully observed Mo Awu for a while before receiving the laptop and said aloud to Tang Xiu, “I can transfer the money to your account now, but how can you guarantee you won’t kill me?”</p><p>“I always mean what I say. I promised I’ll spare your life, so I won’t kill you,” said Tang Xiu indifferently.</p><p><em>‘Guarantee? Oral statement is not a guarantee!’</em></p><p>Somehow, Angelo couldn’t help but feel a bit uneasy. But he still gritted his teeth and bit the bullet and deposited more than 1 billion dollars in his Swiss Bank account to the account Tang Xiu gave him. After the wire transfer was completed, he asked, “Can I contact my father now?”</p><p>“No hurry.” Tang Xiu waved and said, “Let’s deal with some other things first. Will Art, Angelo just transferred the money to my account, so… shouldn’t you also transfer the money? Don’t joke with me that what you just said is to amuse me. I’m pretty much a petty man and that will make me angry.”</p><p>Inwardly, Will Art had some regrets for he had already offended Angelo Dolan, but Tang Xiu didn’t intend to kill that fella anymore. It would mean that he must be careful to guard against this guy in the future.</p><p>“Alright, I’ll transfer the money now.”</p><p>Will took the laptop and transferred 5.5 billion USD to Tang Xiu’s account through a dozen bank accounts.</p><p>Wearing a happy smile, Tang Xiu thought that it was truly unexpected that he could earn such a big harvest while hunting Angelo Dolan. The money he squeezed out of the two men was nearly 7 billion dollars, which was a little over 40 billion in RMB!</p><p>“Making money by robbing and being a brigand is truly great. It’s so easy to make money. Anyways, Tang Guang, send Angelo and his men off. I hope they can learn a lesson from this and never trust others in the next life.” Tang Xiu sat back on the sofa and lifted one of his legs atop the other and issued an order with a smile.</p><p>“Got it!”</p><p>After storing the laptop into the interspatial ring, Mo Awu instantly appeared in front of Angelo Dolan. Before he attacked the fella, two sword lights directly flashed and slew the two old men who had been badly wounded. He then controlled the immortal sword and impaled Angelo the moment after.</p><p>“Puff…”</p><p>Angelo Dolan coughed up a mouthful of blood and covered his pierced chest. Disbelief was all his eyes showed as he shouted, “Why? You obviously took my money. Why still kill me?”</p><p>“I just said I wouldn’t kill you, but I never said that my men wouldn’t.” Tang Xiu mockingly replied, “Your House Dolan is already damned, and I’ll make sure to get rid of the SOE company as well as the rest of armed forces under your House.”</p><p>“But why?!” Angelo’s body trembled and shouted as dizziness began to engulf him.</p><p>” <em>Heh</em> , you may be known as the best genius of House Dolan, but your status is too low, so you’re not qualified to know anything.” Tang Xiu grinned.</p><p><em>BAM…</em></p><p>Angelo slammed into the floor and died in just half a minute.</p><p>Fear was evident in Will Art’s eyes, for he never expected that Tang Xiu would turn hostile in but a flash. He was all smiling and amiable when he just asked for money, but now he just directly killed Angelo Dolan. If… if he ordered his men to kill him, then he would…</p><p>Plopping down on his knees, Will Art said aloud with a face full of fear, “Please spare my life, dear Mr. Tang. We have no hatred whatsoever. I did threaten Mo Awu and Kuwako Yamamoto then, but it was because I valued their abilities. As long as you can spare me, I’m willing to pay you another $5.5 billion once I return. Please give me three days. The money will definitely be on your account within three days!”</p><p>Tang Xiu floated up and stepped on the void step by step. Looking at pleading Will Art, he smilingly said, “There’s no need to be afraid, Will. I just said I won’t kill you, so I won’t kill you myself. Besides, I know when to stop. You’ve given me 5.5 billion, so I can guarantee your life. And let’s spare the next 5.5 billion.”</p><p>The statement made Will Art more scared since Tang Xiu wouldn’t demand more money. His heart was like falling into a glacier and he bitterly said, “W-what… else do you need, Mr. Tang?”</p><p>Tang Xiu stroked his chin and said, “If I didn’t misunderstand, you just had a deal with Angelo Dolan about a diamond mine in Africa, right?”</p><p>“Yeah. House Dolan took over a large diamond mine in Africa; it was just recently discovered.” Will Art nodded without hesitation. “The mine has large diamond reserves that it will even impact the diamond market and prices around the world if all of it is mined.”</p><p>Tang Xiu’s eyes lit up and he smilingly said, “House Dolan robbed that diamond mine, so why can’t we snatch it from them? You’ve seen my power, and I can tell you that these men of mine are but a few among many others I have. I can dispatch a much more powerful team of cultivators if I want to.”</p><p>Will Art stared dumbly and probed. “Mr. Tang, you mean… you’d like to cooperate with us to snatch that Dante diamond mine from House Dolan? And then share the profits and interests later?”</p><p>Tang Xiu raised up five fingers and lightly said, “50-50 shares.”</p><p>Will Art’s eyes lit up and immediately said aloud, “30-70! You get 70% and House Art will take 30%. What do you think?”</p><p>“Like I said, 50-50.” Tang Xiu smiled. “You take it and we can plan the taking over of that Dante diamond mine now.”</p><p>“About that… alright, I agree!”</p><p>Earning much more was something Will Art didn’t dislike naturally. He was now more concerned about his own life and safety, to begin with.</p><p>“Alright, take your men and board my liner!” Tang Xiu waved and said, “I’ll deal with the present problem before finding you.”</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Will Art wasn’t afraid that Tang Xiu would resort to any machinations since such means were not needed. The man would just straightly kill him if he wanted to.</p><p>On the deck, Tang Xiu watched Will Art disappear into the cabin of the liner he boarded along with his four men. His eyes slowly shifted to Angelo Dolan’s dead body and he gently kicked its waist with his toe. Then, he coldly said, “Your life, those genetic warriors’ lives, and the 1 billion dollars you just transferred are nothing but interests. I’ll demand the principal debt with your family in the future, so I hope everyone from your House Dolan is living well now.”</p><p>After a while, he returned to the liner. As the liner slowly left and sailed away for five-plus nautical miles, those two luxury liners exploded.</p><p>Sitting on the cabin, Will Art watched the explosion scene. His heart twitched a few times as his losses this time were just too great—more than the figure he earned in the last five years. Further, he could expect to face some greatly troublesome issues even if he could go back alive this time.</p><p>“Sect Master!” Mo Awu quickly came to Tang Xiu’s side and whispered, “We’ve released those four models and some people who have nothing to do with them as per your order. We put them on four small canoes, but the chance of them to land ashore alive is almost zero.”</p><p>“They have encountered such a thing, so it doesn’t matter,” said Tang Xiu faintly. “Only, can they row those canoes to the nearby island?”</p><p>“The storm will sweep over the waters here in about 20 minutes, and the closest island is about 300 to 400 nautical miles away,” said Mo Awu. “Additionally, there are many sharks nearby, so they are dead already.”</p><p>“If they die, then just let them die!” replied Tang Xiu apathetically. “Those women are not chaste, virtuous, nor are they martyrs. Their deaths will rid the world of some disasters.”</p><p>Mo Awu looked at Will Art and asked, “Sect Master, what if this guy spreads what we’ve done today? Will it cause trouble for us?”</p><p>Tang Xiu shot a look at Will Art, whose complexion greatly changed, and smilingly asked, “Well, will you?”</p><p>Will Art raised his left arm and solemnly said, “I’ve already forgotten everything that happened today! I only remember that I got hit by a storm at sea that led to the deaths of many men. Only I and these four men of mine survived, and we were lucky to bump into Mr. Tang who saved our lives.”</p><p>“You’re very smart, Mr. Art.” Tang Xiu praised. “I love dealing with smart people, and you’ve also made it up with your money although you’ve offended me. Therefore, I hope we can be friends in the future, and even… partners.”</p><p>“That’s for sure!” replied Will Art respectfully.</p><p>“You’re a smart man, and you know how tremendous the power I have at my fingertips is,” continued Tang Xiu with a smile. “If I want to obliterate your family, I can just send a group of my men to slay every living thing in your House, be it humans or animals. Hence, you must know what should be said and what shouldn’t.”</p><p>“I understand. Please rest assured,” said Will Art respectfully.</p><p>“Alright, let’s chat about that diamond mine now!” said Tang Xiu with a happy face. “The mine is said to have large reserves of diamond deposit, so House Dolan will send a large number of elite soldiers to guard it. But what I want to know is, do you have any good idea to snatch this diamond mine?”</p><p>Eyes flickered with lights, Will Art said in a deep tone, “There’s no need for you to act, Mr. Tang. Just send someone to help and I’ll secure that diamond mine very quickly.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
