He let out a long face and cried out after hearing it, ” <em>Ugh</em> , how can you give me this thankless task, Cap’? If by any chance I go overboard and broke the spirit of… Young Master Tang, wouldn’t it be a grave offense?”</p><p>“Spare me the chit chat and just do it lightly, alright?!” said Li Zaibiao unhappily. “It will be fine given your skill to control your strength.”</p><p>Yang Hu rolled his eyes and murmured, “But fists and feet have no eyes, you know that! If I were to hurt Young Master Tang, you and idol will blame me.”</p><p>Sitting on a chair, Tang Yunde was at a loss whether he had to cry or laugh. Then, he said aloud, “Hey, Yang Hu, don’t worry and act like you always do! I won’t flinch even if you make this kid vegetative as long as you got the ability. But of course, you’ll lose face if you lose.”</p><p>“Waah, rest assured, idol!” Yang Hu grinningly said, “Maybe I dare not boast when facing others, but facing the Young Master… <em>uh, cough, cough</em> … well, I mean, I’m still a bit stronger.”</p><p>Tang Xiu frowned deeper and watched Yang Hu shake his arm. He immediately hooked his finger and said, “Let’s cease speaking rubbish so as to save you from making a fool of yourself. Just come. I’ll give you three moves handicap.”</p><p>His statement stunned Yang Hu, and the smile on his face disappeared. He immediately sneered as he saw Tang Xiu’s indifference. “Young Master Tang, your father is my idol, but it doesn’t mean I’ll treat you the same. Three strikes, huh? Then unleash everything you got. But I hope you’re not some weak shrimp and get done in by a few cuffs and kicks.”</p><p>Tang Xiu shook his head in response. His body flickered and appeared in front of Yang Hu in an instant, barring the fella of any room to react as he delivered a punch to his cheek. Though he only used a tiny fraction of his strength, Yang Hu’s big body was still sent flying backward.</p><p><em>Bam, bam, bam…</em></p><p>His figure followed closely like a shadow as a series of whipping kicks hit Yang Hu’s body. The latter could only scream pitifully and turned like a bottle that tumbled and rolled on the floor for six meters away before finally stopping at the feet of several stalwart men.</p><p><em>Cough, cough…</em></p><p>The series of blows almost made Yang Hu choke. Finally, he coughed violently for a while and then looked up with a disbelieving expression.</p><p>“…”</p><p>The room turned quiet.</p><p>No… accurately speaking, it was deathly still.</p><p>Apart from Tang Yunde, everyone in the entire warehouse was staring dumbly at Tang Xiu. Some rubbed their eyes to make sure they were not seeing things.</p><p>Tang Xiu shook his head and spoke, “You know, you should’ve figured out the strength of your opponent before you acted like some pretentious pricks. Know yourself and know thy enemies to be ever-victorious. And honestly speaking, you’re like an ant to me. You’re still not my opponent even if I use less than 1% of my strength.”</p><p>Li Zaibiao sobered up from his shock. A scowl suddenly appeared on his face upon hearing Tang Xiu’s remark. He just thought that Tang Xiu was nothing but a youngster with no strength to truss up a chicken. He didn’t expect he’d transform majestically in a flash and defeat the soldier whom he had trained and became an expert.</p><p>“How did you do it?” Li Zaibiao inquired with a gloomy face.</p><p>At this moment, intense curiosity was seen on the faces of the nearly 80 stalwart men in the surroundings as they quickly broke into discussions—</p><p>“Yeah! How did he do it? I just felt my eyes were seeing things. It was like an illusion. Yang Hu may not be the strongest here, but he still can last dozens of moves against most of us. He can deal with tens of hoodlums and still be fine. So, how can he got beaten that easily?”</p><p>“His speed was so fast that I missed his moving route. I’d similarly get beaten if I were in his shoes.”</p><p>“Holy cow! I truly lost my sight. I never thought he was a hidden expert. But… that Yang Hu brat is also at fault for taking him lightly. He wouldn’t have ended up that bad if he were to face him with caution.”</p><p>“I never thought of such an outcome, either. I thought the play wouldn’t be fun to watch. That kid is not bad, he can barely enter my eyes.”</p><p>“…”</p><p>All the comments were straightly ignored by Tang Xiu. He looked at Li Zaibiao who was staring at him and lightly smiled. “Well, Uncle Li, don’t tell me you’ve forgotten what I just said. It’s a taboo to look down upon anyone and we must never treat anyone lightly in the future even though the opponents you’re facing are children, since those kids may not be those you can deal with either.”</p><p>The man in question took a deep breath. He turned to look a certain burly man nearby and shouted, “Ah Lu, go ahead and exchange some blows with him. Remember, you won’t get dinner tonight if you lose.”</p><p>The burly man who got shouted at suddenly looked bitter. He scratched his head and said, “Uh, Cap’, can you change the punishment? I’m confident I can defeat… <em>umm</em> , Young Master Tang… but well… everything has some contingency, you know. If by any chance I were to lose like that Yang Hu brat, I don’t wanna starve!”</p><p>Li Zaibiao angrily growled. “Cut the crap! Just get your ass over there and do it. And fucking gimme your 100%, alright!”</p><p>The burly guy, Ah Lu, shrugged and looked at Tang Xiu. He let out an honest and pure smile. ” <em>Uh</em> , seems holding back isn’t allowed for the sake of my dinner, Young Master Tang. You gotta be smart here, and I’m afraid I’ll have no supper tomorrow if I display an awful show.”</p><p>“No worries. You can definitely have your meal for tomorrow’s dinner, but I’m sorry for today, though.” Tang Xiu hooked his finger and lightly smiled.</p><p>A cold light flashed in Ah Lu’s eyes, and he instantly charged toward Tang Xiu aggressively like a tiger coming out of the cage. His speed was very fast as he delivered a whooshing flying kick towards Tang Xiu in the blink of an eye.</p><p><em>BAM…</em></p><p>Tang Xiu raised his arm with a seemingly slow movement. Yet, in fact, it was very fast to the extreme and easily blocked the swift and fierce kick. In an instant, his figure was closing in to Ah Lu and his arm gently moved to the guy’s waist.</p><p>“Hiss…”</p><p>The sound of Ah Lu’s gasping for cold breath was heard, while the guy himself looked horrified. As he landed back to the floor, he staggered backward a few steps and rubbed his aching waist. He stared at Tang Xiu and said, “You can block my whipping kick in the air, huh? That’s awesome. You’re strong and your strength is really beyond my expectations, Young Master Tang. But I hope you’re also prepared for the following moves.”</p><p>He slammed the tip of his feet on the floor in the next instant. The moment his hand left his waist, Ah Lu was as though turning into a cannonball and dashed towards Tang Xiu faster than his first charge. A loud whooshing sound was heard when he delivered his punches. His charging trajectory was also very particular like a curved arc as his strike quickly went towards Tang Xiu’s nose.</p><p><em>PA…</em></p><p>Tang Xiu moved lightning-fast and instantly grabbed Ah Lu’s wrist, causing the man’s complexion to change. The fella felt like his waist was being clamped by an iron pincer, and the enormous impact rendered his arm unable to move forward. Just as he tried to punch Tang Xiu with another fist while using his leg to obstruct Tang Xiu’s respond, a pain suddenly struck his abdomen.</p><p><em>BAM…</em></p><p>Ah Lu’s body flew straight to the back, his bottom in front and feet and head behind. He flew for four-plus meters away before falling with a sitting posture on the floor.</p><p>“You’re too weak.” Tang Xiu shook his head and said, “I’m really disappointed if all of you here only got similar strength. Even the children I’ve trained are stronger than you all.”</p><p>“SHUT UP!!!”</p><p>Although these tens of big guys were shocked by Tang Xiu’s strength, they were much stronger than Yang Hu and Ah Lu. Tang Xiu’s statement caused some of them to storm forward.</p><p>Nearby, Ni Penggang, who was witnessing the scene just now, hurriedly got up to stop them. Tang Yunde, however, immediately grabbed his arm, shook his head and smiled. “Have I ever talked big to you before, Penggang? Lemme tell you something, this is just child’s play to Xiu’er. He hasn’t been serious all this while, else none here can face him, even if all of them are ganging up on him.”</p><p>Ni Penggang’s complexion looked ugly as he replied, “What nonsense are you talking about, Brother Tang? Don’t you know the strength of our brothers? Tang Xiu may be able to beat Yang Hu and Ah Lu, but the two of them are not ranked in the middle among our 80 brothers. But those who are charging at him now are all experts!”</p><p>Tang Yunde just smiled in response. “Our so-called experts are all like jokes in Xiu’er’s eyes, Penggang. Just let them play well since they wanna play. I’m not even worried as his father, so what are you worried about?”</p><p>Hesitating for a moment, Ni Penggang then sat again with a scowl on his face, saying, “You’re the one who said it, so I won’t say much. But I really wanna see if your cherished son can easily beat these brothers of ours like you just said.”</p><p>“Let’s just wait and see, shall we?” Tang Yunde meaningfully replied, “I promise you that Xiu’er will surprise you.”</p><p>“He has given me a pleasant surprise already, alright.” Ni Penggang groaned. “But thanks, and don’t scare me.”</p><p>Beside them, Ni Jie’s eyes were flashing bright as she heard the conversation between her father and Tang Yunde. She suddenly interjected. “Dad, I also think Tang Xiu is really strong, though. Have you noticed it yet? Yang Hu and Ah Lu didn’t succeed in giving any injury to him whatsoever and got easily beaten instead. Do you think Uncle Li can also do the same?”</p><p>Ni Penggang stared blankly for a moment, then his expression changed to disbelief. He got up yet again; his daughter’s reminder made him realize the issue. Let alone Li Zaibiao, he was an expert himself, yet such a feat was not something he could do!</p><p>“I also think you’ve yet to realize another issue, Dad,” Ni Jie went on. “Tang Xiu can easily defeat Yang Hu and Ah Lu, so what does that mean? It shows he didn’t go all out. Besides, his plain expression tells me he is much stronger than what he has displayed!”</p><p>“This…”</p><p>This time, Ni Penggang was completely shocked!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
