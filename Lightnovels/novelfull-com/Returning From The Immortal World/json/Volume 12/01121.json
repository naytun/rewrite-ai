He wasn’t even rated as a second-rate expert whatsoever, and he could only bully some street rats then. After cultivating for two years, however, his cultivation level progressed and was in the late-stage of Foundation Establishment. Killing experts at the martial arts grandmaster level was absolutely an easy task, as easy as killing an ant for him.</p><p>“Master…”</p><p>He began to speak but then hesitated.</p><p>Tang Xiu seemed to understand what was going through his mind. His eyebrows raised and he asked, “Do you have no confidence in yourself? Just because they are definitely experts from the state’s Special Abilities Bureau, so you dare not to meet them at all?”</p><p>“I feel like that a bit, indeed,” said Chen Zhizhong with a forced smile. “After all, I’ve only been a businessman before, while they are the armed forces of the country. They may not obey my command at a critical moment even if I want to, and the consequences will be unimaginable.”</p><p>“You also said that you used to be a businessman. But your current identity is different. You’re now a cultivator, more so, one who is at the Foundation Establishment Stage. You can say that the late-stage of Foundation Establishment is nothing in my eyes, but you’re like a powerhouse with god-like abilities in the eyes of others. Now, let me tell you something. There are no more than five people in the entire Special Abilities Bureau who can defeat you.”</p><p>Chen Zhizhong’s eyes lit up with self-confidence raising up in his heart. He looked at Tang Xiu’s serious expression before gritting his teeth and saying, “I won’t let you down, Master. Definitely.”</p><p>“Zhizhong, you must always remember that you’re no longer your past self.” Tang Xiu finally smiled and said, “The current you is no longer limited to the business world, nor to the country. You’re now my disciple, so your vision can’t be confined to this Earth only. The universe is vast and countless races exist. There’s also a higher plane above ours with myriad races and countless walks of life, countless of whom are experts who have the ability to destroy the sky and earth with a snap of their fingers. You’ll face these celestial immortal powerhouses with their godly powers in the future, not the mortal beings on Earth.”</p><p>“Hiss…”</p><p>Chen Zhizhong couldn’t help but gasp in cold air. It was his first time hearing such a shocking statement from Tang Xiu.</p><p>“M-Master… is what you said all true? There are countless aliens in our universe and there’s also a higher plane? Are there really existences who can destroy Earth with just a snap of their fingers?” Chen Zhizhong’s voice shivered, yet there were fear and expectation in his voice.</p><p>Tang Xiu sighed inwardly. He realized that Chen Zhizhong wasn’t given much guidance from him ever since the man had become his disciple. It felt rather pitiful to think that he even told him about the cultivation world and even some higher levels. After rekindling his cigarette, Tang Xiu said, “Zhizhong, I think it should be time you hand over your company to your son, no? Huh? You… something is amiss with you!”</p><p>His expression suddenly changed and intense killing intent overflowed in his eyes. He immediately grabbed Chen Zhizhong’s neck and a sharp dagger was ready to stab his heart.</p><p>“M-Master…?!”</p><p>Disbelief covering his face, Chen Zhizhong simply couldn’t believe that Tang Xiu would attack him all of a sudden.</p><p>“Hmph… extend your wrist!” Tang Xiu snorted coldly and ordered.</p><p>Upon hearing this, Chen Zhizhong immediately extended his left wrist and felt Tang Xiu move the sharp dagger away from his heart. Only then did his expression slightly relaxed.</p><p>Tang Xiu put away the dagger and checked the man’s pulse. He also used his spiritual sense to inspect him and was immediately furious since there was a seal on Chen Zhizhong’s body. This restriction seal was also extremely prohibiting, which not only blocked Chen Zhizhong’s strength but also affected his perception, causing his spiritual sense to be trapped within his mind sea, all the while creating a huge discrepancy in his memory.</p><p>“Master!” cried out Chen Zhizhong cautiously.</p><p>Loosening his neck, Tang Xiu then asked in a heavy voice with eyes full of killing intent, “Have you seen anyone after you left Kunlun Mountain? Can you think of anyone who has messed up with you and tampered with your mind?”</p><p>Chen Zhizhong looked confused and shook his head. “After that?! I just returned to Star City and immediately occupied myself with the company affairs, while handing over all the big and small things to my son. About every day… huh? How can I not remember anything after that?”</p><p>Tang Xiu released his wrist and said in a deep voice, “Come with me!”</p><p>****</p><p>Liangang City.</p><p>The Blue Ocean Goldfine Hotel was located in the new development zone of the city which was also a bustling area. Of the 24-story hotel building, the 20th floor was allotted as the presidential suite, which also had the most expensive rate among the hotels in the city.</p><p>The room of the presidential suite 2045 was dark and the cool, with the chilling wind blowing in from the outside due to the opened windows. Two figures flickered as they moved lightning-fast and entered through the window. A cigarette lighter lit up a cigarette as the light reflected Tang Xiu’s handsome face.</p><p>“We could’ve checked in and taken the room directly, Master.”</p><p>Chen Zhizhong had no idea as to why Tang Xiu didn’t want to check-in and rent the room but sneaked into this presidential suite instead. It must be noted that he brought a group of his men to come over and they were now staying at this hotel on the 19th floor.</p><p>“No can do.” Tang Xiu shook his head and said, “The entire Liangang City should be under the surveillance of the Darkwind’s intel operatives. If my guess is correct, Wen Feng must have caught the news that you’ve come to Liangang. It’s even highly likely that a lot of intel operatives of the Darkwind have been quietly lurking in the dark here. Once the news that I’m here is exposed, I’m sure they will start investigating my whereabouts.”</p><p>The explanation made Chen Zhizhong understand quickly. Then, he asked, “What exactly happened to me, Master? I just can’t seem to remember anything of what I was doing every day on the way here. I don’t even have a clue of where I was every day, either.”</p><p>“Someone has messed up with you and tampered with your memory,” said Tang Xiu lightly. “Although the seal hasn’t completely sealed your cultivation, they used the restriction seal technique very sophisticatedly. You could’ve lived up to three months safely if not for me finding out about it. But your internal organs would begin to fester and your meridians would be cut off three months later. At that time, no one will be able to save you unless a Perfected Golden Immortal Stage descends to Earth. Also, your memory has been affected by that restriction, causing you to forget many important things.”</p><p>Chen Zhizhong’s complexion turned pale and fear was evident on his face. Only after Tang Xiu was done explaining did he stutteringly speak, “M-Master… you’re right. I… I’ve always been feeling that my memory is dropping, and there’s a lot more I can’t even remember lately. It turns out that someone has unexpectedly tampered with it.”</p><p>Tang Xiu pointed to the floor in front of him and said, “Sit down and kneel! I’ll help you remove the restriction on your body. Further, I’ll also need a strain of Serene Articulation Grass to awaken your sealed memory.”</p><p>Chen Zhizhong hastily sat down cross-legged in front of Tang Xiu and asked, “What kind of herb is this Serene Articulation Grass, Master? I’ve never heard of it before.”</p><p>“Of course. This grass is not even a medicinal ingredient. It’s a plant that can cause serious damage to the human body, instead,” explained Tang Xiu lightly. “Generally, the poison experts and the likes who love tinkering with poison also act cautiously when dealing with this plant. They extract its internal essence and mix it up with a snake dragon to concoct a dreadful poison.”</p><p>“Where I can find such Serene Articulation Grass?” asked Chen Zhizhong.</p><p>“Spare yourself from worrying about that. Someone will send it tomorrow evening at the latest if there’s no accident,” said Tang Xiu.</p><p>Having said that, he reached down to hold Chen Zhizhong’s head and cast a secret art. It took only a few minutes for him to remove the restriction seal in his body.</p><p>****</p><p>Liangang City, Golden Coast Club.</p><p>In the exquisite garden European house filled with a faint jasmine scent, a thin and pale white-haired old man was sitting cross-legged on a futon in cultivation. Suddenly, his body slightly shook and he spurted out a mouthful of blood. His eyes suddenly opened and intense killing intent overflowed from his eyes.</p><p>“It’s broken?!!”</p><p>The skinny old man floated up and instantly appeared by the window. He watched the shadows of the trees swaying under the dark night as he slightly gripped his fists.</p><p>BANG…</p><p>The entire window was blasted out with just one punch.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>Figures flickered and headed over lightning-fast from the surroundings. In just a few breaths, tens of men in black night vests and black masks appeared outside the window.</p><p>“What happened, Elder Wei?”</p><p>Wen Feng, adorned in pajamas and slippers, moved over quickly from the distance. He looked at the old man by the window who looked sinister and furious. It suffocated him and he secretly trembled as he went forward and respectfully asked.</p><p>“The seal I cast on Chen Zhizhong’s body was broken,” said Elder Wei.</p><p>The statement surprised Wen Feng, and he said, “Elder Wei, didn’t you say previously that no one besides you in this world can break the seal you cast on Chen Zhizhong’s body? It was just cast for a bit of time, but how come…”</p><p>“SHUT THE HELL UP!!!”</p><p>Eyes full of killing intent, Elder Wei stared daggers at Wen Feng. Should the latter dare to say more, he would be in for torturing death even if they both belonged to the same organization.</p><p>Wen Fen held his breath. Even though he was angry inwardly, he still put on a respectful face on the surface. Others may not know how ruthless and dreadful this Elder Wei was, but he was crystal clear about it, for at least a few of the brothers who came out of the training camp with him in the past died in the hands of this geezer.</p><p>Elder Wei panted and gasped a few times. His murderous eyes left Wen Feng and shifted to the direction of the city. Then, he chillingly said, “Not even a Nascent Soul Stage expert is able to remove the seal I cast on Chen Zhizhong’s body. Unless that person is skilled in the secret art of my sect and is proficient in restriction rules. Now I ask you, is there any other expert around Chen Zhizhong?”</p><p>Wen Feng hesitated for a moment before saying, “I’ve sent men to investigate everything about Chen Zhizhong some time ago. They did find a very powerful expert around him, and the person in question is only a young man in his 20s. But… even if this person is very powerful, he shouldn’t be powerful to this degree, right?”</p><p>Note:</p><p>Another plot holes. The author definitely said that Chen Zhizhong has reached Nascent Soul after obtaining the Diablo Praecantator Clan’s inheritance in the previous chapters. Well, I just can’t change what is written in the raw as my job is just translating the series, though.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
