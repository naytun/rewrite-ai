I’m quite a celebrity now; don’t we have to pay attention?”</p><p>“Hahaha, so what? You got a great car and an amazing belle, what are you being unhappy for?” Ouyang Lulu crisply laughed. “Besides, you’re still young. That means radiating the passion around, right? Alright, let’s head off, you take the wheel and I’m sitting shotgun, okay?”</p><p>“Fine, then!”</p><p>It was Tang Xiu’s intention to leave this place quickly, so as to prevent waiting for Mu Wanying to wake up and let hell break loose. Hence, he directly took the driver’s seat and started the car to head outside right after the door was closed. However, although the road was very wide, it had been blocked by three supercars.</p><p>“What’s going on here?” Tang Xiu lowered the window and asked.</p><p>The middle-aged man went to greet him and respectfully said, “These little gangsters want to create trouble, so we’re stopping them, Boss.”</p><p>“I see. Just notify the security guards and throw them out directly.” Tang Xiu waved and said, “That’s right. Kang Xia called me some time ago and she also mentioned the issues here. Now that I’ve bought all the villas in this part, then the security work here must be dealt with, too. Let them go if they want to. The road is for everyone. Just straightly ignore them if they don’t trespass and disturb the villas.”</p><p>“Understood!” The middle-aged man nodded respectfully.</p><p>The bleached-haired youth, who had crawled up from the ground at this moment, looked at Tang Xiu like he wanted to swallow him. He immediately yelled furiously upon hearing Tang Xiu’s words, “Hey, get off your ass the car, Boy! Your dogs keep biting us at random. You must give me an explanation now, else this problem is far from over!”</p><p>Tang Xiu couldn’t help but burst into laughter and said, “We’re all adults here, can we not be so naïve? Besides, you’re all the haves judging from your looks, no? Haven’t you also gotten some nine years of compulsory education yourselves? Can’t you at least preserve some quality and dignity? Also, spare yourselves from swearing since it will lower your status.”</p><p>The youth held his breath. Expression twisted, he angrily yelled again, “What the hell? What does it have anything to do with you whether I have quality? This villa complex doesn’t belong to your family, yet you’re acting so arrogant, even your men are hitting people? Isn’t this obviously your mistake?”</p><p>Tang Xiu secretly sighed inwardly and got out of the car to stand in front of the youth. He deeply bowed to him and spoke with a sincere expression. “Then I apologize for my crude and reckless behavior. I hope you can forgive me since they are just doing their job.”</p><p>“This…”</p><p>Never once the youth dreamed that Tang Xiu would resort to such a move. Originally, he wanted to create some excuses as a pretext to attack him, but it was he who was now left helpless.</p><p>A young man next to him yelled, “Hey, do you think everything is over with such a casual apology? How can there be such a good thing in this world?”</p><p>“Apologies aren’t good, so what do you want then?” asked Tang Xiu back.</p><p>“Compensation, and all the expenses on medical, nutrition, mental loss, and delaying work!” The young man sneered. “Aren’t you rich, buying so many villas here? We are not blackmailing you, but paying 1 million in compensation is fine!”</p><p>“Paying 1 million in compensation will do just fine, huh?” asked Tang Xiu with a strange expression.</p><p>“That’s for sure.” The youth sneered.</p><p>Tang Xiu turned to the middle-aged man and lightly said, “I give you 20 minutes to bring me 1 million. Also, there’s a café nearby. Send the money there.”</p><p>“Affirmative!” The man immediately went to do his bidding.</p><p>Tang Xiu shifted to the four youths in front again and smilingly said, “You want me to pay compensation, so how about heading to the café with me, then? Things have been too boring for me recently, so you can accompany to chat there.”</p><p>The bleached-haired youth shot a glance at the Porsche, but consciously covered his cheek immediately after seeing Ouyang Lulu in the front seat. After a moment of pondering, he sneered. “Let’s head there. Don’t think we’re afraid of you.”</p><p>Tang Xiu just gave squinted eyes and returned to the car, heading straight out of the villa complex. Soon after, four supercars stopped outside the café and Tang Xiu brought Ouyang Lulu inside the café and headed straight to a quiet corner, followed by the four youths.</p><p>“Can I ask you something, Lulu?” asked Tang Xiu with a smile after taking a seat.</p><p>“What is it?” asked Ouyang Lulu back curiously.</p><p>“Do you know if there’s any abandoned factory around here?” asked Tang Xiu. “It’s best that it has a large area and is located in a very desolate place.”</p><p>Ouyang Lulu gave it a thought and then shook her head. “I have no idea. Shanghai’s development is literally everywhere. You may have to look outside Shanghai, I’m afraid. That’s right. Chang Xi! I just remembered. The junction of Shanghai and Chang Xi is kind of remote and desolate. I used to participate in the race game with Chi Nan and I remember passing by some spots with a very big factory. I asked Chi Nan out of curiosity then, and she said that it was an abandoned industrial area.”</p><p>“Take me there later.” Tang Xiu nodded.</p><p>“What will you do at such a place, though?” asked Ouyang Lulu.</p><p>“I want to refine some equipment,” said Tang Xiu.</p><p>Ouyang Lulu nodded in response. As she was about to speak, she suddenly heard Tang Xiu’s phone ringing in his pocket.</p><p>Tang Xiu stared blankly for a moment. He just took out his cell phone from the interspatial ring. It was rather unexpected to have someone call him now. Then, he took out the phone and looked at the screen, immediately patting his head and wryly smiling. “Alas, I forgot something.”</p><p>Having said that, he pressed the answer button and Li Cai’s voice then came out, “Is it you, Divine Doctor Tang?”</p><p>“I am. You’ve arrived?” asked Tang Xiu.</p><p>“I arrived in Shanghai yesterday afternoon,” said Li Cai. “I called you then, but your cell phone couldn’t be reached. Can we come to visit you now, Divine Doctor Tang?”</p><p>“Ah, where are you now?” asked Tang Xiu.</p><p>“At the Blue Starfish Mansion,” answered Li Cai.</p><p>Tang Xiu pondered for a moment, and then said, “Text me the address and I’ll come over later. We can speak about anything else when we meet.”</p><p>“Alright, then. Sorry for troubling you, Doctor Tang,” said Li Cai excitedly.</p><p>After hanging up, Tang Xiu looked at Ouyang Lulu and asked, “Anyway, where’s this Blue Starfish Mansion?”</p><p>Without waiting for Ouyang Lulu’s answer, the bleached-haired youth sitting not far from them wore a contemptuous look and mocked. ” <em>Hmph</em> , I thought you were a very powerful person, it turns out that you don’t even know the Blue Starfish Mansion at all. Really. The upper-class society is nothing like a hillbilly such as you can understand.”</p><p>Tang Xiu just shot him an indifferent glance and his eyes quickly went back to Ouyang Lulu.</p><p>The person in attention slammed the table and glared at the youth while glowering. “Don’t you dare run your mouth without concern, or I’ll slap you until your mother won’t be able to recognize you!”</p><p>The youth originally wanted to hit Tang Xiu in front of Ouyang Lulu and display his brilliance, but he didn’t expect that it would make her go mad at him, instead. His expression immediately turned ugly and he just glared at Tang Xiu, grunting with a lowered voice. ” <em>Hmph</em> , what a coward, hiding behind a woman.”</p><p>“You’ll know whether I’m a coward or not later,” replied Tang Xiu apathetically. “Also, no need to rush to bother them either, Lulu.”</p><p>Upon hearing this, Ouyang Lulu immediately understood Tang Xiu’s intention. She didn’t understand why Tang Xiu would compensate these fellas a million yuan before and then brought them here. Now, she figured out that Tang Xiu was waiting to give them the money and then make them pay for the arrogance.</p><p>“The Blue Starfish Mansion is located on the coastline southeast of Shanghai. It’s the most beautiful upscale resort area in Shanghai, slightly better than the Paradise Manor. Also, you need to drive to the Bay Port and take a boat from there.”</p><p>Tang Xiu nodded and got up. “Alright, let’s go there first.”</p><p>The bleached youth abruptly got up and jeered. “What’s up, mate? Did you just find an excuse to escape or something? I already told you I must get a million-yuan compensation from you, got it?”</p><p>“The money will be definitely yours. But I’m in a hurry, so I got no time to keep you accompany,” said Tang Xiu. “I’ll send someone to give you the money if you’re willing to stay here. But if you’re not, you can go with me to the Blue Starfish Mansion, and I’ll tell my subordinate to send the money there.”</p><p>“Of course I’m going with you! Whom do we ask for the money if you run?” After the bleached-haired youth was done speaking, he straightly took out his cell phone and dialed a number. After his call was picked up by the other party, he smilingly said, “It’s Dalong here, Young Master Kun. Anyway, I’m going to play at the Blue Starfish Mansion with Zizi and the rest, and um… let’s meet there and have a chat.”</p><p>****</p><p>The Blue Starfish Mansion was a small island surrounded by bodies of water and was as large as several football fields. The construction of the resort, however, was rather extraordinary. It depicted the exquisiteness of a garden in the southern region and the beauty of the northern landscape, the combination of both through wonderful workmanship created a marvelous creation excelling nature itself and became a sight to behold.</p><p>Inside a pavilion, Hu Shaokun hung up the phone, then looked at the 16-plus-years-old-looking girl in front of him and smilingly said, “You can rest your worries about Auntie Zhuang’s illness, Cai’er. I learned something about Divine Doctor Tang. He can definitely cure Auntie’s illness since he’s willing to help. I’ll definitely honor him as honorable guess and treat him to my best.”</p><p>“Thank you, Brother Shaokun,” said Li Cai.</p><p>The guy turned around and looked at the coastline not far away. His eyes swept at the sea surface and slowly took a breather, before saying, “Cai’er, it’s indeed very important to let Doctor Tang treat Auntie, but you had better let Doctor Tang to examine your body too. It’s been 9 years already, and you’ve always been looking like this. I’m afraid problems with your health will arise in the future.”</p><p>Li Cai was silent for a moment. She looked a bit helpless as she replied, “I’ve already checked my condition in many hospitals, both in the country and abroad. The current medical science just can’t examine whatever is happening to my body. I’m afraid…”</p><p>Hu Shaokun was back to his senses and sternly looked at her and said, “Cai’er, isn’t the check-up result of auntie’s illness similar even though we’ve brought her to tens of large hospitals? If Divine Doctor Tang can cure her illness, he’ll definitely be able to cure yours, too. But if you don’t want to talk to him about that when he comes, I’ll speak to him myself. I don’t care how much I must pay him.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
