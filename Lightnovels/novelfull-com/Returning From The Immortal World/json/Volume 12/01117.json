Just as they were a few meters away from him, he slowly raised his hand to stop them and spoke, “The three of you should be better than the duo from before, but it’s still not enough for me. Why don’t we raise up the level?”</p><p>Li Zaibiao paced back two steps and looked at Tang Xiu with fear in his eyes. At the same time, a deep sense of shame also filled his heart as he felt that he had made a spectacle of his own incompetent subordinates.</p><p>He was waiting. He needed to wait for the later sparring’s results. If Tang Xiu was defeated, he wouldn’t be too embarrassed, though he would lose some face. But if Tang Xiu won again, he would really lose face toward everyone in the entire warehouse.</p><p>One of the tree stalwart men snorted and asked, “How do you want to play?”</p><p>“You three may be regarded as experts in the eyes of others, but you’re still far from enough in my eyes,” said Tang Xiu with a light smile. “You wanna have a bout with me, so the seventy-plus of you might as well gang up on me so you can last longer.”</p><p>“Arrogant!”</p><p>“You’re too cocky!”</p><p>“Just put it off after we play!”</p><p>The three men looked angry and then charged at Tang Xiu at the same time.</p><p>Tang Xiu only shook his head and smiled in response. This time, he didn’t retreat or even try to evade. He moved forward to clash with their howling punches and kicks head-on. After connecting his punches, in but a flash, their bodies were sent flying upside down. Tang Xiu grinningly said, “I told you that you three are not enough, didn’t I? Suppressing and abusing you is too easy for me. Now you saw it for yourselves. You didn’t listen to my advice, isn’t that a shame?”</p><p>“Lost… this is disgraceful…”</p><p>The trio who fell to the floor at this time truly wished they could dig up a burrow to hide. They now had figured out how terrifying Tang Xiu was. Even though the three of them teamed up, they still… got beaten up by him, not even lasting for a second.</p><p>The remaining 70-plus people were now staring dumbly at Tang Xiu as if they were looking at a monster.</p><p>‘Powerful and valiant!’</p><p>They felt many adjectives had been cast into the shade, and there was no way to express how fierce Tang Xiu was. They were all well aware of the strength of those three brothers, yet they didn’t even last for a second—which was unbelievable.</p><p>Li Zaibiao was similarly dumbfounded. He never imagined the sparring match would develop this way. Tang Xiu was simply not a human. He was like a humanoid beast.</p><p>Sitting nearby, Ni Penggang had just sobered up from his shock. He directly covered his forehead after seeing such a situation. He then looked at the smiling Tang Yunde and said, “I’m now convinced, Brother Tang. Those who can make me feel so are not many in this life, but your son is definitely one. He’s really amazing! It turns out genuine cultivators are so powerful.”</p><p>“I already told you that, didn’t I?” responded Tang Yunde smilingly.</p><p>“Well, I admit I didn’t believe it in the slightest! I’ve heard Tang Xiu’s skill in Chinese medicine, but never heard of this side of him before!” said Ni Penggang with a dry smile. “I know the combat force possessed by cultivators, but it’s too far from I can grasp, so…”</p><p>Tang Yunde waved to interrupt him and smilingly said, “No need to continue. I brought Xiu’er today means that he’s capable of taking over the things here and manage our brothers. You should understand already how I do things, Penggang.”</p><p>With a solemn expression, Ni Penggang nodded. “I didn’t think it through, Brother Tang. I’m sorry about that.”</p><p>“Nah, leave out the formality. We’re all brothers.” Tang Yunde smiled.</p><p>Ni Penggang finally let out a sincere smile and nodded. “Well, I can finally be at ease to hand these brothers of ours to Tang Xiu, then!”</p><p>Tang Xiu looked at the shocked and stunned Li Zaibiao. Intending to give him a good lesson, he said aloud, “What are you guys gawking for? Apart from your Captain, all of you just come at me! My Dad and Uncle Ni want to give you guys to me and make me your leader, so you had best to unleash every ability you got and show me what you’re capable of. I want to see whether you’re qualified to be my men!”</p><p>“Say what?!”</p><p>“We are being given to him?”</p><p>“This…”</p><p>Each and every one of the 70-plus experts of this security firm was shocked, but they immediately shut their mouths upon looking at Yang Hu and the rest who hadn’t yet crawled up from the floor.</p><p>Li Zaibiao drew in a deep breath. His eyes flickered with lights and he said in a deep voice, “Didn’t you guys hear Tang Xiu’s order?! What the hell are you gawking for? Move your asses and join hands together. Don’t make me lose face!”</p><p>“MOVE!”</p><p>“ATTACK!”</p><p>“STRIKE!”</p><p>“…”</p><p>The 70-plus stalwart men finally unleashed their fierce sides and stormed over at Tang Xiu. They didn’t hold back and squeezed out every strength they could unleash as though fighting with their lives on the line, and quickly appeared in front of Tang Xiu.</p><p><em>BAM, BAM, BAM…</em></p><p>Still wearing a calm expression, Tang Xiu constantly walked in the midst of these men, while easily avoiding their attacks. But each time he moved, a strong man was sent flying. He used his strength in a particular and ingenious method. None of them was seriously injured since he could send them flying.</p><p>Li Zaibiao retreated four or five steps, his eyes bulging as though they were going to pop out of their sockets. The scene he was witnessing was like a dream.</p><p>It was too… scary! Too fierce and unbelievable to the extreme!</p><p>He was perfectly aware of the strength of these 70-plus brothers. Any one of them was an expert, a powerhouse in the eyes of numerous others. They could literally move everywhere on the battlefield and reap the lives of their enemies. At this moment, however, they were like docile lambs being ravaged by a ferocious hungry wolf.</p><p>By now, Ni Penggang was completely struck dumb. Many of these brothers were people he had trained personally, so he was well aware of their strength.</p><p>Yet now, was he dreaming?</p><p>Next to him, Ni Jie’s eyes were getting brighter and brighter and eventually turned into worship as the scene unfolded. She was a proud woman and, even though she was very polite on the surface, was a proud peacock to the bones. But now, her arrogance was completely defeated by Tang Xiu’s strength.</p><p>He was too fierce, amazing, and outright terrific!</p><p>This man not only got the looks and ability but also went against the natural order in terms of combat power! If she could find such a boyfriend… no… if she could find a husband like him, she would definitely feel safe in the future.</p><p>40 seconds!</p><p>It was all it took for Tang Xiu to beat them. Some of whom crawled on the floor while enduring the pain, losing their spirit to charge forward again.</p><p>They were simply scared! They used to face the hail of bullets. They were not afraid to face powerful enemies, yet such fear overwhelmed them at this moment. They felt they were not facing a human being. This young man was simply a Demon King—a great devil with fearsome strength.</p><p><em>‘Fighting him? You’re simply looking to get abused and beaten up!’</em></p><p>Tang Xiu clapped and nodded happily. “Well, you guys are not bad. At least you can persevere for some time, though it was just about 40 seconds. Anyhow, can we now have our sparring, Uncle Li? You blurted out that my arms and legs are too thin and I don’t have the strength to even truss up a chicken, no?”</p><p>Li Zaibia’s face turned red, and his shame almost cover his face and run. His lips squirmed as he stared at Tang Xiu’s vague smiling face. Then, he coughed a few times and waved. “Let’s forget that, shall we? I admit my mistake. I broke the taboo and looked down on you out of my arrogance. I apologize for my previous attitude, Tang Xiu. I’ve already learned my lesson. I’ll definitely keep it in mind.”</p><p>The man’s attitude was much to Tang Xiu’s satisfaction. The reason why he sparred with the rest of these guys was that he wanted to make Li Zaibiao, as the captain, understand that no matter what kind of enemy they faced, they must never take them lightly. Being responsible of the brothers, failure was just a minor issue, but it was a huge deal if they were killed due to this negligence.</p><p>“If that’s the case, then that’s all. And you guys, your injuries are nothing. I got impeccable control over my strength, so you’ll recover in about ten minutes. You won’t even feel pain by then.”</p><p>“…”</p><p>Everyone who heard this couldn’t help but twitch their mouths.</p><p><em>‘He has good control over… his strength?’</em></p><p>This kid is really going to be against the natural order! How can he still pay attention to employ such discretion in such chaotic brawl? Where is his bottom line, exactly? How strong is he, exactly?</p><p>Tang Xiu returned to Tang Yunde and Ni Penggang’s side. Then, he lightly smiled and said, “How was my performance, Uncle Ni? Do you feel relieved giving them to me now?”</p><p>“If I were to feel restless giving them to you, I’m afraid there’d be nothing in this world that can make me feel at ease anymore,” replied Ni Penggang with a forced smile. “But then, you’re amazing, and you deserve my admiration, Tang Xiu. Your old man has given birth to a good son!”</p><p>Pride instantly swelled up in Tang Yunde’s heart after hearing this. He then got up and smiled. “Xiu’er, you mustn’t be complacent and become arrogant even though your Uncle Ni praised you. These are our brothers. They are the most reliable and trustworthy people we have, so you had better treat them well in the future and help them become stronger.”</p><p>“You can rest assured about that, Dad, Uncle Ni.” Tang Xiu nodded.</p><p>Having said that, he turned to look at the stalwart men who had crawled up from the floor, saying, “Lemme introduce myself again. I’m Tang Xiu, Tang Yunde’s son. In your eyes, I’m just a 20-something young man. Further, I look frail and seemingly have not much strength. But I can tell you now that even hundreds of people with similar strength like you are still not my opponents.”</p><p>“…”</p><p>Everyone looked at Tang Xiu in silence. Although they felt the statement was exaggerated and extremely arrogant, they chose to be silent since it was them who were very arrogant previously, and it hurled back and struck them with more pain and shame.</p><p>“The current you are very weak. But that’s because you were not under my guidance.” Tang Xiu went on, “That’s why I won’t take you guys with me for the time being, so you’re staying here. However, I’ll teach you a set of cultivation techniques and develop a training program for you. If you don’t achieve the strength I’ve specified in three months, you’ll be eliminated since you’re not qualified to be my men.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
