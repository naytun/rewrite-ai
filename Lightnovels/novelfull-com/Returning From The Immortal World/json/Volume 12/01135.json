Though it’s also certain that I’m actually hoping that he could lose the bet since I can brazenly demand him to support me fully if that happens.”</p><p>Now, Hu Shaokun’s brows stretched so much that he shook his head and sighed. “I’d truly feel sorry for you if that happens. The annual profit of Paradise Manor should be quite a lot, more than enough to cover your spending. But why give it to a man just so he can take you up, though? I know Tang Xiu’s identity is by no means ordinary, but don’t you think you’d have more dignity if you can support your spending with your own income?”</p><p>“You know, I finally understand what Tang Xiu once told me, that it’s really very difficult to see eye to eye with others from the secular world. Hu Shaokun, you think you know everything about Tang Xiu, but do you really know him that deeply, though? Anyway, let’s drop this off. It’s meaningless speaking about this topic, to begin with. I’m sure you’ll get to understand it once Tang Xiu is done with his treatment.”</p><p>Hu Shaokun no longer talked, though he really sympathized with Ouyang Lulu at the moment. Words had it that women in love may lose their intelligence, and he used to not believe it. But now he experienced it firsthand.</p><p>It was like a blind trust—something no different from love-struck foolhardiness!</p><p>In the next room.</p><p>Tang Xiu walked to the table’s side as he took a seat and quickly wrote a set of cultivation art. He didn’t give it immediately to Li Cai, however, but mystifyingly said, “What do you think about Hu Shaokun giving me the 49% of the Blue Starfish Mansion?”</p><p>Li Cai was silent for a few seconds before slowly replying, “Brother Shaokun doesn’t have any side of him that can be suspected in this regard. Well, at least to me and my mother. But I understand what you wanna hear from me. I’d want nothing more than he’d lose 49% shares of the business, and then he’d ask compensation from me. But I believe that he’ll never do that. Absolutely.”</p><p>“What if I can really cure your mother, then?” asked Tang Xiu with a smile.</p><p>“If that happens, then I’m going to use my wealth to make up for his loss,” said Li Cai.</p><p>Tang Xiu gave a thumbs up and praised. “Hu Shaokun is so incensed, yet he can agree to exchange your mother’s life for 49% shares of the Blue Starfish Mansion. He has proven himself a very good man. But your trust in him also shows me what kind of people you two are. No worries! I won’t take those shares even if I can cure your mother’s illness. However, that 100-million-yuan payment is still not enough. The following treatment will cost quite a lot.”</p><p>“You’re really the legendary good doctor as rumors have it outside, Divine Doctor Tang!” Li Cai sincerely said with eyes lit up. “I’m even more convinced that you can cure mom now.”</p><p>“Alright, spare me the flattering and memorize this cultivation art which emphasizes on the heart and mind. Afterward, I’m going to teach you something else,” said Tang Xiu with a smile.</p><p>“State of mind cultivation art?”</p><p>Li Cai glanced at the paper with curious eyes. She read it seriously and asked in surprise, “Did you just say that this is a cultivation art, Divine Doctor Tang? What exactly are cultivation and this True Qi something? Is it the likes of something those experts from the martial world have?”</p><p>” <em>Haih</em> , after all is said and done, you actually have quite the good luck, you know.” Tang Xiu sighed. “So is your mother, since you both run into me. I’m really glad for you both. If anything, just memorize this set of mind cultivation art I taught you. But you can never tell another soul even if that person is the one who you trust the most like Hu Shaokun. Further, there’s still another promise I’d like to have from you.”</p><p>With a solemn expression, Li Cai seriously said, “Then I’ll never pass on what you just taught me to others, Divine Doctor Tang. And please tell me, what else do I need to promise you?”</p><p>“In this life and this world, you must never become enemies with House Tang of Beijing,” said Tang Xiu. “Additionally, you must remember that you owe me, which is equal that you owe House Tang a huge favor. If House Tang is in trouble in the future, then you have the obligation to do your best to help them once.”</p><p>“I, Li Cai, vow that as long as it is within my power, I’ll never sit back and ignore the Tang Family should such a situation arise. You told me that I only have the obligation to help the Tang Family once, but I vow before you that I’ll help them thrice, should I have the ability.”</p><p>Li Cai’s vow was much to Tang Xiu’s satisfaction, so he nodded and said, “Alright, then. I’ll teach you how to practice this cultivation art first.”</p><p>After spending two hours, Tang Xiu was able to convey all the aspects of cultivation to Li Cai. Certainly, it was also thanks to her own intelligence that she could quickly and completely memorize the circulation route for True Essence energy and the acupoints the energy must go through.</p><p>“Take this Life Essence Pill and begin cultivating the mind cultivation art I just taught you. And keep in mind that you must focus and calm your heart and mind when doing that.” Tang Xiu took out the longevity pill and handed it over to Li Cai.</p><p><em>Life Essence Pill?!</em></p><p>The medicinal pill aspect was something out of Li Cai’s knowledge, but she chose to believe in Tang Xiu at this moment and directly swallowed it without hesitation.</p><p>“AH?!!”</p><p>Torrential heatwaves rolled down from her throat into her belly, and she couldn’t help but scream due to such a mysterious situation.</p><p>“Don’t let your mind wander and immediately do what I just told you!” Tang Xiu ordered in a deep voice.</p><p>Li Cai quickly restrained her mind and focused it.</p><p>Time passed by. When seven hours passed, Li Cai’s body suddenly shook. She opened her eyes and could smell the stench from her own body.</p><p>Tang Xiu didn’t hesitate to take out the Essence Amassing Pill and spoke to her, “The stench is coming out of your system. But that’s because of the impurities discharged from your body. I know that you like cleanness, but it’s not yet the time for that. Take this Essence Amassing Pill first, I’ll help you to step on the cultivation path.”</p><p>Li Cai felt her cheek a bit hot since she didn’t think that she was so dirty with so many impurities contained in her system. However, after observing Tang Xiu’s reaction, she found that the man didn’t even seem bothered by the stench from her body. Only then did she finally feel relieved, taking the Essence Amassing Pill and swallowing it at once.</p><p>Night then came in the blink of an eye.</p><p>When she opened her eyes again, her lips squirmed a few times and her eyes were full of brilliance. She felt power was evident in her body, and she felt much better in shape than she ever had before.</p><p>Tang Xiu, who sat cross-legged in front of her, took out a jade bottle from his interspatial ring and handed it to Li Cai. “There are some Life Essence Pills here. You must take one every day without fail. Afterward, begin cultivating according to the mind cultivation art I taught you. After you’ve consumed all these Life Essence Pills, contact me directly, as that will be the time to treat your mother.”</p><p>Li Cai got up and her nose moved ever so slightly. Then, she said, “I’ll keep your instructions in mind, Divine Doctor Tang. But… could you please wait for a while? I… I wanna take… a shower.”</p><p>Tang Xiu let out a faint smile and waved. “It’s rather late now. I’m not going to stay longer. Go and have a bath. I’ll come back to see you after you’ve finished taking the Life Essence Pills.”</p><p>“But it’s late, and I didn’t see you eating today either, Divine Doctor Tang.” Li Cai hesitated before speaking out. “If anything, why don’t you stay for a bit longer and have a meal here? I’ll tell Brother Shaokun to provide you a room so you can spend the night here!”</p><p>Tang Xiu was about to reject but then suddenly remembered that Mu Wanying was still in the Bluestar Villa, while he was with Ouyang Lulu now. There would be no way to leave this imperial lady tonight, but God knew what would happen if he were to take her to the Bluestar Villa and run into Mu Wanying there.</p><p>“Alright, then! I’ll spend the night here.” Tang Xiu finally agreed and turned around to leave.</p><p>At this moment, Hu Shaokun was pacing back and forth with an anxious expression in the hallway outside the room. Tang Xiu and Li Cai hadn’t come out even once from the room all day long, keeping him restless.</p><p><em>Creak…</em></p><p>As the door was opened, Hu Shaokun trembled and looked up to see Tang Xiu coming out from the inside. He then hastily asked, “How’s Aunt Zhuang? Is she cured yet?”</p><p>“I already told you previously that I can’t treat the patient, for the time being, else Li Cai will be harmed, didn’t I?” replied Tang Xiu. “But no worries! I can begin the treatment in a few days.”</p><p>“What have you been doing all day, then?” asked Hu Shaokun hurriedly.</p><p>Li Cai came out from the door behind Tang Xiu at this moment. She didn’t even look at Hu Shaokun and hurriedly ran towards the bathroom.</p><p>“This stench…”</p><p>Hu Shaokun frowned deeply and raised his hand to pinch his nose. The intense stench gave him the urge to throw up. He was shocked that the stench was actually coming out from Li Cai’s body.</p><p>He knew her of her love of cleanness. She usually washed up even if she was only a little sweaty and sprayed herself with a fragrant perfume. And yet, how did she become so stinky today?</p><p>“Alright, stop gawking and staring blankly like that, will you?” said Tang Xiu. “Li Cai is fine. I just use a special means to discharge the impurities in her system, which will be very beneficial for her. Also, we’re staying here tonight, so please arrange a room for us.”</p><p>Hu Shaokun felt relieved upon hearing it. However, he was still very curious about how Tang Xiu was able to discharge impurities out of the human body. <em>Is it the likes of the marrow purifying and vein cleansing the experts from the Martial World do?</em></p><p>“Okay, I’ll tell someone to arrange it immediately. Do you want a room or two?”</p><p>Tang Xiu turned his head towards the next room’s door and replied back to Hu Shaokun lightly, “What do you think?”</p><p>“Ugh…”</p><p>Hu Shaokun raised his hand to touch his face with an awkward expression. Although he didn’t want to see Ouyang Lulu spend the night with Tang Xiu here, the reality was cruel. They were a man and a woman, and also a couple. It was perfectly justified for them to spend the night together.</p><p><em>Truly a pity!</em></p><p>He couldn’t help but shake his head in secret.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
