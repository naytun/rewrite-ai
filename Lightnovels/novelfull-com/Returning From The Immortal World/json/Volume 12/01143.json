She just watched the conversation of these youngsters and didn’t have any thoughts at all. But then, she thought about establishing a relationship with Tang Xiu and smilingly interjected. “I may hardly involve myself in the business now, but the Shens have too many mouths to feed and we need to make a living as well. How about adding the Shens into the count too?”</p><p>Tang Xiu shot a look at Miao Wentang and Zui Ying. He just shrugged in response and smilingly said, “Well, I don’t care much how many people cooperate in this matter. It’s all fine with me as long as Brother Gu agrees.”</p><p>Gu Changmin himself was, of course, excited. He knew the status and identity of Miao Wentang and old lady Zui Ying. Adding Tang Xiu, the endeavor would absolutely be a success with the four cooperating. The joined forces of the four could even easily surpass the largest online shopping platform and those large logistics companies in China, right?</p><p>What is the capital for one to have the say in doing business?</p><p>Money is for sure the answer!</p><p>You can do it as long as you have money—and to a certain extent, money can even make you smash the sky. With the four forces cooperating, you can demand money with money and gain power with power. Why would you worry about not making money from the investment?</p><p>Jin Xingkui smacked his lips and felt quite helpless inside. Most of his capital had been invested in the newly developed real estate project. Although he’d be able to withdraw a large sum in the next six months, his hands were tied as of now. Therefore, even if he realized that this project was a sure shot to make money, it was unfortunate that the desire didn’t conform to his energy.</p><p>Suddenly, Ji Mu jumped into the conversation with a dry smile. “Uh, everyone… can you count me in this project? The Jis may not have much capital, but it’s great to take a ride with you all.”</p><p><em>The Jis of Changxi don’t have much capital?</em></p><p>Gu Changmin couldn’t help but roll his eyes. He may be a man with 10 to 20 billion in assets, but compared to the Jis of Changxi, he was like a dwarf—nothing to speak of. The Ji Family was a very prominent family in Changxi, and even if their net worth was less than 100 billion, they had at least 80 billion in assets.</p><p>However, he realized a certain issue and inquired. “Brother Ji, both my hands are open if your family wants to join in too. Besides, you and Brother Tang are friends. I’m fine as long as he trusts you. Only, there’s a big issue I’d like to ask. Can you act on behalf of your patriarch?”</p><p>“Well, although my father is still the family patriarch, he has already handed over most of the power in the family to me,” answered Ji Mu with a smile. “I can humbly say that I do have the right to act on behalf of the Ji Family.”</p><p>Gu Changmin was excited to hear that and replied, “That’s great, then! Five parties have collaborated and each of us has our own strength, so we can really expect a great outcome. Alright, let’s discuss the specifics…”</p><p>The meeting by chance now turned into a business investment cooperation forum. Neither Tang Xiu nor the others had ever thought about it previously.</p><p>However, it was just natural that no one would refuse any businesses that could make money, to begin with.</p><p>After the discussion, the five parties finally decided to invest 10 billion each, with a total investment of 50 billion. Although Gu Changmin himself couldn’t afford such amount, for the time being, he was still willing to borrow the funds from the bank to make it up to 10 billion yuan.</p><p>With the pre-project cooperation agreement done, Tang Xiu waved and said, “Alright, everyone. We’ve done the talking, I won’t involve myself in the business affairs. But I’ll call Kang Xia about the contents we just discussed. You can discuss the specific operations with her later.”</p><p>Due to the time, everyone booked a room in the Blue Starfish Mansion after the discussion and prepared to rest for a night before leaving. However, although Ji Mu also took a room for himself, he didn’t immediately rest but stay with Tang Xiu while watching the others leave.</p><p>“You got something in mind?”</p><p>Tang Xiu shot a glance at Ouyang Lulu. As she headed to the guest room, Tang Xiu turned to Ji Mu and asked.</p><p>Ji Mu nodded and said, “Do you have some time, well, in the next few days, by chance? I’m going to marry my girlfriend and I’m hoping that you can attend the wedding.”</p><p>“Damn. Your marriage has been dragged on to the present?” blurted out Tang Xiu in amazement.</p><p>“It’s not like I wanted to drag it until now, mind you,” replied Ji Mu with a wry smile. “It’s just there’s something wrong with the child, so it kept getting delayed.”</p><p>“What happened?” asked Tang Xiu with a slightly shifted expression.</p><p>Ji Mu shook his head but didn’t say anything. He then helplessly said, “Let’s leave it at that. Simply put, the child is gone already, and I’ve been with her for a long time recently, so her mood is much better now. But you haven’t replied to me whether you got some time for the next few days, Brother Tang.”</p><p>“You got the fixed date?” asked Tang Xiu.</p><p>“The first day of the next month,” answered Ji Mu.</p><p>Tang Xiu calculated the time and said, “The first day next month is just several days later. I’m not sure if I won’t have any issues I need to deal with, but I’ll definitely come to Changxi if I got nothing urgent. But if I do, I’ll send someone else to deliver you the congratulatory gift. Don’t mind it if it does happen, though.”</p><p>Ji Mu immediately let out a happy smile after hearing this. Then, he nodded and said, “I got you. It’s fine with me.”</p><p>Quickly after, Ji Mu returned to his room and Tang Xiu took out a half-pack of cigarettes from the interspatial ring and lit one up. He didn’t rush back to the room to rest but stood in the corridor while watching the building reserved for the auction. The building was still brightly lit up and there was no other information passed to him.</p><p>In actuality, Tang Xiu already felt at ease after finding out that the problem originated from the military. He didn’t need to explain anything to Duanmu Lin as long as it was not a problem with the Magnificent Tang Corp. Honestly speaking, there was no effect whatsoever to him with the appearance of Aeroglider here, he could even gain some benefits instead. At the very least, these rich businesspeople now learned that this Aeroglider was a product manufactured by his company, some of whom would definitely jump out to support him when came the time to be sold to the public.</p><p>“You aren’t going to sleep?”</p><p>Half an hour later, Ouyang Lulu came out of the room and came to Tang Xiu’s side, asking softly.</p><p>“Don’t worry about that.” Tang Xiu shook his head and smilingly said, “It’s just that I haven’t yet heard anything from the auction hall. I just can’t fully set my mind at rest.”</p><p>“In fact, there’s nothing to worry about for you since the problem did not lie with your company.” Ouyang Lulu commented. “On the contrary, it’s Duanmu Lin who must give you an explanation since it was the military who erred.”</p><p>“I already know that you’re a smart one. Never thought you’ve completely grasped the issue too, though,” said Tang Xiu smilingly. “Well, let’s just hope Duanmu Lin can quickly figure out the problem since I won’t really feel at ease otherwise.”</p><p>“Why not directly involve yourself in the investigation since you don’t feel relieved, then?” commented Ouyang Lulu with a light smile.</p><p>“I get you on that. And Duanmu Li is also unlikely to bash the shit pot on our heads if the problem lies in the military.” Tang Xiu shook his head.</p><p>Ouyang Lulu was about to go on, but she suddenly noticed that a group of people was marching fast toward them, and her eyes finally caught Duanmu Lin leading them.</p><p>“Well, there they are. The result you’ve been waiting.”</p><p>Tang Xiu nodded lightly and just quietly waited for Duanmu Lin to come. Then, he asked the man, “Have you investigated it, Senior Duanmu?”</p><p>The man’s expression was a bit ugly as he nodded. “Let’s find a quiet room to speak about it.”</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Tang Xiu led Duanmu Lin and the rest to the room he had a drinking gathering with Miao Wentang and the rest. The attendants had it cleaned up already and it was very clean now.</p><p>After taking a seat, Duanmu Lin forced a wry smile and began speaking, “Tang Xiu, the investigation has been carried out, and it’s clear that there’s a problem within the military. I’ve already communicated with some people from the army and learned that a retired officer named Li Yuquan stole the Aeroglider from the army’s warehouse due to special reasons. We also inquired about its serial number. It’s exactly the Aeroglider that appeared in this auction.”</p><p>“What I want to know is, what’s the special reason you just said?” asked Tang Xiu.</p><p>“It’s hard for me to talk about the open and closed struggles in the army. Let’s save the topic and don’t ask about it anymore. I need to tell you now that Li Yuquan is now a wanted man all over the country, and the intelligence network from our state’s intel agency has been completely dispatched. We’ll definitely catch him in no time.”</p><p>Tang Xiu nodded in response and said, “This incident also gave me a wake-up call. It seems that the Magnificent Tang Corp. must also start strengthening our security. Senior Duanmu, I’m quite free for some time, and I kind of have an idea of forming my own security company. What do you think?”</p><p>“A security company?”</p><p>Duanmu Lin felt helpless inside and was left with no choice. Tang Xiu’s power was already big enough. He would be even more powerful if he set up a security company. Many things that were inconvenient for cultivators could be handed over to this security company.</p><p>Should he disagree with him?</p><p>He realized he really didn’t have the guts to do so. After all, this young man precisely hit the exact entry points. If he were to disagree with him and in case another incident happened that the Aeroglider produced by his company flowed to the outside, it would have nothing to do with Tang Xiu. He didn’t have to bear the responsibility after the incident if he disagreed with him forming his own security company.</p><p>“Just do what you see fit, Tang Xiu! I’ll contact some people concerning the formalities you need to set for the security company.” Duanmu Lin finally nodded.</p><p>“Thanks, Senior Duanmu,” said Tang Xiu smilingly. “Just contact me if you have anything I need to deal with. I’m obliged for the peace and stability of our country.”</p><p>Duanmu Lin got up and said, “I’ll keep your words, so I can sleep soundly in the future. Anyhow, I’ll disturb your rest no longer. This problem will come to an end when we catch Li Yuquan.”</p><p>“Ah, there’s another thing I want to ask you, Senior Duanmu.” Tang Xiu also got up and spoke again.</p><p>“And that is?” asked Duanmu Lin.</p><p>“What are you going to do with the wealthy business people and celebrities attending this auction?” asked Tang Xiu.</p><p>“What else can I do about them?” Duanmu Li forced a wry smile and said, “They only attended the auction and didn’t break any laws whatsoever. Even if I do hold the arbitrary power from the state, it’s not like I can just act unreasonably! But they all have signed a confidentiality agreement, and I’ll send people to keep tabs on them. Whoever dares to disclose any news of this Aeroglider, then it’s equal to them committing treason and be subjected to a death sentence.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
