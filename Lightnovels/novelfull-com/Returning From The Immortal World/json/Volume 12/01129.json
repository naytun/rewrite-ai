Shortly after, the lady herself caught up and gave him a message that caught him off guard.</p><p>“Anyhow, she just left, but she didn’t say anything where she’s heading. She passed this to me for you.” Mu Wanying opened her bag and took out a beautifully wrapped gift box from it.</p><p>Wearing a complicated look, Tang Xiu just looked at the gift box handed over to him. He fell into silence for a moment before receiving it wordlessly and stuffing it into the interspatial ring.</p><p><em>‘Everything has been buried in the past, and there’s no need to get entangled and be bothered too much, I think. Since she chose to leave and disappear into her own world, perhaps this is the best ending possible.’</em></p><p>It was Mu Wanying instead who looked surprised. “Aren’t you going to open it and have a look?”</p><p>“Is it necessary, though?” asked Tang Xiu back calmly.</p><p>Mu Wanying was silent. She kept having this feeling that an unclear relationship existed between Tang Xiu and Han Qingwu. She even had the thought the woman was someone who once hurt Tang Xiu deeply. But she could only suppress her intense curiosity since Tang Xiu never wanted to mention anything about Han Qingwu. She then changed the subject. “Anyhow, have you noticed something? There’s a kind of news on the Internet that a patient from the capital of Beihe Province has been shuttling back and forth to Star City and Shanghai. The person is hoping to find you to cure a disease and save someone. She hasn’t been able to find you yet, hence why she has been looking for you through the internet.”</p><p>Tang Xiu slightly furrowed his brows, then shook his head. “It’s not easy to find me ever since I stopped giving medical examination, though. Besides, I’m not purely a Chinese medicine practitioner, to begin with, so it’s up to fate to encounter patients, more so treating them and saving their lives. If anything, I won’t just sit by and watch if I happen to encounter them directly, but I won’t leave for the Beihe Province just because the person has been looking for me through the internet.”</p><p>“I get that.” Mu Wanying nodded. “Besides, there are too many patients needing treatment nowadays. You’re gonna die of exhaustion if each one of them finds you through the internet and you force yourself to visit them. But I’ve been curious about something, though. The person said that there’s a very valuable gift for you if you can cure her mother’s illness. What I really wanna know is what kind of gift it is.”</p><p><em>A gift?</em></p><p>“The world is full of precious and valuable gifts. It’s good if you can get them, but you can’t force it if you don’t.” Tang Xiu shook his head. “If anything, what should be mine will naturally appear in my hands, but there’s no need to force myself if it isn’t meant to be.”</p><p>“Well, forget it since you’re not interested in this matter, then.” Mu Wanying chuckled and said, “Anyway, let’s change the subject. What do you wanna do next, though? Are you going back to Nine Dragons Island?”</p><p><em>What I’m going to do next?</em></p><p>Confusion struck him all of a sudden. Tang Xiu had been feeling like there was always something pushing him forward, and he had to tend to all sorts of things. But now, he didn’t know what to do next.</p><p><em>Return to Nine Dragons Island?</em></p><p>Now that he had settled everything there, it didn’t matter whether he stayed there or not. Kang Xia was managing the Magnificent Tang Corporation and he didn’t need to be concerned about it, whereas some others were dealing with the minor things. All of a sudden, he found himself having nothing urgent to tend to.</p><p>Upon seeing Tang Xiu’s expression, Mu Wanying realized that Tang Xiu should be very leisurely for some time, so she smilingly said, “Well, might as well stay in Shanghai if you have nothing important to deal with, I think. Besides, we’ve been apart for a long time, so just stay with me.”</p><p>Tang Xiu gave it a thought for a moment and smilingly nodded. “Alright! I’m gonna stay in Shanghai for now, before busying myself on other issues. That’s right. How is it going with your advertising agency?”</p><p>“Business has been great as always. We got clients and orders because of you.” Mu Wanying chuckled and said, “You know, these Big Bosses have been introducing me to some other businesses ever since then. It’s likely that many people have heard of our relationship, and even some big companies from other provinces come visiting my company to seek cooperation.”</p><p>“So, you’ve been very busy then?” asked Tang Xiu.</p><p>“Not really.” Mu Wanying shook her head. “Although it keeps me occupied, I found myself a golden manager. His reputation may be inferior to Kang Xia’s, but he’s, nevertheless, a famous figure in the advertising industry, so he’s been dealing with the general affairs of the company. I don’t have much to do unless an important issue arises.”</p><p>“Is he reliable, though?” Tang Xiu was surprised.</p><p>“I dragged him out of the world’s Wall Street financial center myself. We are of the same alumni, whereas his wife and I can be called good sisters, and I know he’s a trustworthy person. Also, I’ve been paying attention to the financial aspect of the company and there are no problems so far,” explained Mu Wanying smilingly.</p><p>“Well, then it’s best putting your time to cultivation since you’re not that occupied,” said Tang Xiu smilingly. “Anyhow, I suddenly recalled something. I’m going to Beijing for sometime later. You can come with me if you want.”</p><p>“What for, exactly?” asked Mu Wanying curiously.</p><p>“I’m a cultivator. I want to make my family members stronger since I can do it,” answered Tang Xiu smilingly.</p><p>“You wanna teach cultivation arts to your Tang clansmen, by chance?” Mu Wanying was surprised.</p><p>“Yup.” Tang Xiu nodded. “I can shelter the Tang Family for a decade or two, but I can’t shelter them forever, can I? You must, nevertheless, have a generation of outstanding talents if you want to make your clan stand up. Also, you should also make your own family get stronger, too. I’ll give you a set of cultivation arts if you want, you can then decide whom you’ll teach it to.”</p><p>Mu Wanying pondered for a moment before shaking her head. “It won’t work for the time being, though.”</p><p>“And why is that?” asked Tang Xiu curiously.</p><p>“That cultivation art is yours, and it must be practiced by your Tang clansmen to a certain degree first,” explained Mu Wanying. “Only then can I teach to the Mus, though to only a handful few of them. You don’t know much about House Mu, Tang Xiu. Although grandpa has made the entire family shaken, the good days are long gone after a long time passed, and some people’s minds are no longer pure. I won’t say about the rest, as you can see that even my Dad…”</p><p>Tang Xiu was relieved and looked at her with a sympathetic gaze. Only now did he suddenly realize that it wasn’t a bad thing that House Tang had been careful in the storms of social circles in Shanghai and Beijing. Without the oppression of House Yao and being a target from other families, the Tangs never would have united as one. They could’ve been ended up like House Mu with so many silk pants scions, which would make House Tang fall sooner or later.</p><p>“You’re a smart person, Wanying. You know what you can do and what you cannot, so you can treat it as you see fit.”</p><p>Mu Wanying smilingly nodded, then suddenly said, “Anyway, since you’re gonna stay in Shanghai for some days, might as well contact the patient who’s been looking for you. I think you can spare your time to treat the patient if they’re willing to come to Shanghai. I’m sure you can govern their illness given your medical skills.”</p><p>Tang Xiu gave it a thought and felt that her reasoning was sound, so he smiled and said, “Alright, find out the contact info of the other party. I’ll call the person and set the time myself.”</p><p>“Alrighty!”</p><p>She quickly activated her phone and found the said post on the internet, and then told Tang Xiu the cell number left by the person—which was directly called by Tang Xiu.</p><p>“Hello, I’m Li Cai. May I know whom I’m speaking to?” a crisp voice was heard from the phone.</p><p>“I’m Tang Xiu. Is it you who have been looking for me on the internet?” replied Tang Xiu.</p><p>“…”</p><p>The person on the phone was silent for a few seconds, and then said, “Are you really Divine Doctor Tang? Can you prove your identity? Please forgive me. It’s because I’ve been receiving many calls recently. Some people are sympathetic and made a call to ask about my mother’s conditions, but some were just trolling about, impersonating you and making my mother’s life and mine worse.”</p><p>“How about we do a video call, then?” said Tang Xiu after pondering for a moment.</p><p>“That’s great!” the person immediately gave a happy response.</p><p>Quickly after, Tang Xiu saw the other party’s face. She was a 16-years-old beautiful girl with very fair skin. Her eyes were especially very pure and very pretty.</p><p>“It’s really you, Mr. Tang?! This is great, so great! My mother is as good as saved already.” Li Cai, who lived in the Beihe Province’s capital, immediately looked happily surprised upon seeing Tang Xiu’s face through the video call.</p><p>“Well, can you tell me about your mother’s condition first?” asked Tang Xiu. “Also, I’m afraid you need to come to Shanghai if your mother really needs my treatment.”</p><p>“That’s not a problem. We’ll head there.”</p><p>Li Cai’s response was ecstatic. Then, she reported the condition of her mother, and finally asked with a look of expectation, “Divine Doctor Tang, c-can… you determine what kind of disease my mother is afflicted with?”</p><p>Tang Xiu was silent for a moment, then shook his head before nodding to her. “I’ve never seen the patient, so I have no way to determine the disease contracted by your mother However, I do have some guesses in mind. But if my guess is correct, then, she can still be treated.”</p><p>“I-if I get your meaning…. then, I… I’ll take Mom to Shanghai immediately, Divine Doctor Tang. Is this your cell number? Where should we be looking for you once we arrive in Shanghai?” asked Li Cai excitedly.</p><p>“It’s indeed my cell number,” answered Tang Xiu. “Also, phone me when you arrive in Shanghai. I’ll send someone to the airport to fetch you.”</p><p>“That’s great! Thank you, Divine Doctor Tang. You’re a good man!” said Li Cai with a grateful face.</p><p>“Treating the illness and saving a patient is what I should do. Well then, we’ll chat again the next time we meet,” said Tang Xiu smilingly.</p><p>Having said that, he directly hung up and then turned to look at Mu Wanying next to him. He saw her face who was about to speak something but hesitated. Then, he immediately asked, “What’s up? Is there something wrong?”</p><p>“Well, I’m just very curious.” Mu Wanying chuckled. “If you cure that person’s illness, I’m sure they will thank you very deeply. I thought you’d ask about it on the phone just now! After all, she’s been looking for you on the internet and has repeatedly mentioned that the thank you gift would be great.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
