But she really couldn’t accept what Tang Xiu just said, even her trust in him was shaken. Her mother to her was the kindest woman in the world and she’d never kill anyone, let alone seven-plus billion people.</p><p>“You definitely made a mistake, Divine Doctor Tang.”</p><p>“My hands are tied. I can’t reveal too many secrets.” Tang Xiu shook his head and said, “But I can tell you some simple things. Your mother was a cultivator in her past life, who eventually ended up becoming a terrifyingly powerful female devil. But her past incarnation was not of this world, but from her memories, I can see scenes where blood flows like a river into a sea of corps piling up like a hill.”</p><p><em>A cultivator and also a female devil?!!</em></p><p>Tears began welling up in Li Cai’s eyes. She adamantly shook her head and said, “That’s impossible. Absolutely. Mom, she…”</p><p>“Each and every one of us has a fate of our own. You just began cultivating and, even though you can only feel the faint fluctuation of True Essence energy in your body, you’ve nevertheless already embarked on the journey of cultivation. There are things you’re eligible to know now, such as the Six Paths of Reincarnation of the Six Great Divisions in the wheel of karma. They exist along with the Netherworld and the King of Hell. Li Cai, the world is still full of mysteries and magic. Just that you haven’t experienced nor are able to imagine them doesn’t mean that they don’t exist.”</p><p>“I need… some time alone.”</p><p>Li Cai seemed to have lost her soul and stiffly left the room. She didn’t even glance at the fragrant dishes.</p><p>Ouyang Lulu watched her disappear with compassionate eyes, then rolled her eyes at Tang Xiu and snappily said, “Telling her such things was too much and too cruel for her, you know that? This may be my first time meeting her, but I can tell she’s just a pure and simple girl.”</p><p>“I taught her a shallow cultivation art just to increase her lifespan,” replied Tang Xiu calmly. “If she works hard and encounters a good opportunity, it’s still possible for her to reach the Great Ascension Stage in the future. However, her state of mind is kind of appalling. She’s like a small grass sheltered by a big tree and it’d be difficult for her to weather the storm. But so long as her mind transforms, she’ll be able to go further in the future. That’s why I think I’d rather act harsher and crueler to her now instead of letting her stumble later. Though it’s a pity…”</p><p>“A pity? On what exactly?” asked Ouyang Lulu, though she could understand Tang Xiu’s point of view.</p><p>“It’s a pity that the bad deeds and evil karma accumulated by her mother are too heavy.” Tang Xiu sighed. “Even if I can temporarily cure her mother, I’m afraid that she only has 10 years left. That’s also because I use Li Cai’s lifespan to prolong her life. That’s also why Li Cai can only live to at most 60 years old.”</p><p>“60 years?!!” Ouyang Lulu was shaken and couldn’t help but gasp a cold breath.</p><p>“That’s right.” Tang Xiu nodded and explained, “Li Cai should’ve had a lifespan up to more than 80 years old if she didn’t meet me. She’s already a little over 20 now, yet she’s gonna die soon. That’s why I gave her the Life Essence Pill and also helped her to step on the cultivation path. If… and I mean if she can work hard and finds a better opportunity in the future, she may live for 10 or 20 years more with the progress of her cultivation level.”</p><p>Ouyang Lulu abruptly got up from the chair, shaking her head and saying, “Isn’t this way too cruel to Li Cai, Tang Xiu? Why didn’t you tell her before?”</p><p>“Because she wouldn’t have even a shred of hesitation to choose to save her mother even if I told her that,” said Tang Xiu. “But being unaware of the consequences she won’t have any burdens in her heart and thus, will be able to live well. She could be unable to withstand the pressure of destiny otherwise.”</p><p>Ouyang Lulu fell into silence since she could understand the reasoning. Whoever knows how long they can live are usually inflicted by the heavy burden to their minds, much less a young girl who only had 10 or 20 years left to live—such a revelation would suffocate and overwhelm her very hard.</p><p>“She’s really pitiful.” Ouyang Lulu sighed faintly.</p><p>“This may be her fate, though it’s perhaps also… her chance,” said Tang Xiu. “Still, it’s up to her mother for what kind of future she’ll have.”</p><p>“What do you mean?” asked Ouyang Lulu, confused.</p><p>“If her mother dies early, I could take her as a disciple and make up for her lost lifespan even if I have to pay a higher price,” said Tang Xiu. “I can even make her stronger as time passes and still possible for her to ascend to immortality.”</p><p>Ouyang Lulu was speechless. It was a topic she was never good at, so she couldn’t say anything about this issue.</p><p>Ten minutes later, Hu Shaokun entered the room and saw Tang Xiu and Ouyang Lulu, who were dining, and curiously asked, “Eh? Wasn’t Cai’er coming over? Where’s she now?”</p><p>“She went back to rest,” answered Tang Xiu.</p><p>Nodding in response, Hu Shaokun then came to Tang Xiu’s front and handed over a bank card. “Anyway, Hao Zizi wanted to meet you in person to apologize to you. But I told him that you’re tired and went to rest, so he entrusted me to give this to you.”</p><p><em>A bank card?</em></p><p>Tang Xiu’s expression turned odd. It felt like every time people offended him, compensating with money became the final solution for them.</p><p>“I’m not short on money!” said Tang Xiu calmly.</p><p>Hu Shaokun hesitated and forced a smiled. “Tang Xiu, Hao Zizi and Wu Dalong are all my good friends. Can you at least look at my face and give them some slack? I know those boys. They’re not that bad, though I admit they got spoiled too much by their families. If anything, you can rest assured that I’ll definitely admonish them harshly so as to make them act low-key in the future.”</p><p>Tang Xiu then took the bank card and inquired. “How much is it?”</p><p>“40 million yuan. They gave 10 million each,” said Hu Shaokun, secretly relaxing.</p><p>Tang Xiu nodded. “This is the least compensation I’ve ever received, but let the matter drop here and now. Also, tell them to give less trouble for their families, lest they invite calamity to befall upon them. Not only will they fall into desperation, but even their Houses will also follow them.”</p><p>“I’ll definitely convey it to them.”</p><p>Still, Hu Shaokun’s face looked solemn. He could tell that Tang Xiu’s words were not only for Wu Dalong and Hao Zizi’s group but also for himself. He recalled Tang Xiu’s identity and felt a faint headache. He would’ve still dared to clash with this man if he was just an ordinary layman. But Tang Xiu was a scion of a super-prominent family, who had proven his brilliance and outstanding qualities—a powerful person who must never be offended.</p><p>“Anyways, do you mind chatting about another issue, Divine Doctor Tang?” Hu Shaokun took out another bankcard from his pocket and placed it in front of Tang Xiu after the latter took the previous one.</p><p>“Huh? Is it necessary for you to give me money since you just want to chat about something, though?” asked Tang Xiu with a strange expression. “If this is about the 49% shares, forget about it.”</p><p>“It’s not about that.” Hu Shaokun shook his head. “I’d have gladly offered it to you had it not been because of today’s issue. But what I want to discuss with you is something else.”</p><p>“Alright. I’m all ears.” Tang Xiu pointed the seat across.</p><p>After taking a seat in front of Tang Xiu, Hu Shaokun forced a smile and said, “Didn’t you tell me that I don’t have long to live? Please have a look at me again, and can you help me increase my lifespan?”</p><p>“Ehh? Didn’t you say you don’t trust me?” asked Tang Xiu oddly.</p><p>“I’d rather say I’d believe what she believes in and never trust what she doesn’t!” replied Hu Shaokun with a dry smile. “If anything, you’re also the famous young Divine Doctor in the country, to begin with. If what you said is real, then I…”</p><p>“Alright.” Tang Xiu smilingly replied, “How much do you have in that card, though?”</p><p>“100 million,” said Hu Shaokun hurriedly.</p><p>Tang Xiu gave a thumbs up and praised. “You’re bold indeed. You have doubts and suspicion about me, yet you still dare ask me to help you with 100 million yuan. Alright, I’ll give you another pill for the money. You can be safe and sound for at least 10 more years after taking it.”</p><p>Medicinal pill?!</p><p>Hu Shaokun shot Tang Xiu a puzzled look.</p><p>Tang Xiu threw a Life Essence Pill to him and spoke, “You got yourself some big benefits, I tell you. However, I already chose to be a good man, so I’m going to do the deed to the end. As long as you take this pill and do good deeds in the next days, you can live for more than 10 years. Also, the more good deeds you perform, the longer your lifespan will be. When you’ve done and accumulated good deeds to a certain extent, you can be guaranteed to have a long life and meet your natural death in bed of old age.”</p><p>Hu Shaokun carefully fondled the Life Essence Pill. After the wax paper cover was torn, he suddenly felt an invisible force hit the back of his hand and the pill instantly shot into his mouth. But when he hurriedly wanted to spit it out, the pill turned into a hot stream in his mouth and rushed into his stomach.</p><p>“This…”</p><p>Hu Shaokun was scared senseless, but he could feel that the surging heat flow didn’t harm him and instead scattered and flowed into his limbs and five bones. In just an instant, his body felt very comfortable and he could tell that his condition was much better than ever.</p><p><em>Is it the likes of a miraculous elixir?</em> Hu Shaokun was wild with joy inwardly.</p><p>A few minutes later, he felt that his body’s condition was much better and healthier. The comfortable feeling even made him feel the urge to sleep, so he bade farewell to Tang Xiu and headed outside. Just as he was about to leave the room, he seemed to recall something and returned to Tang Xiu, took out a golden card from his pocket and handed it over, saying, “Mr. Tang, a small auction will be held tomorrow. Are you interested in attending?”</p><p><em>An auction?</em></p><p>Tang Xiu curiously inquired. “What kind of items are auctioned there, though?”</p><p>“The items auctioned are but a few, but their value is guaranteed,” said Hu Shaokun. “In fact, I have always held two or three small auctions here every year, and only items worth more than 10 million yuan can be auctioned there.”</p><p>Tang Xiu thought that he had nothing to do tomorrow, so he asked the time when the auction would be held. He immediately agreed after hearing the answer. But Ouyang Lulu couldn’t bear with it and shot him rolling eyes. Her attractive and charming looks, however, made Hu Shaokun’s mind wander everywhere.</p><p>After Hu Shaokun left, Ouyang Lulu immediately blurted out. “You obviously promised me a date, shopping, and watching movies tomorrow, no?”</p><p>“Well, the shopping, dining, and watching movies won’t prevent us from participating in that auction, though!” Tang Xiu chuckled and said, “High-level auctions usually have some great stuff, after all. Also, if you happen to find something you like, I’ll buy it for you. Promise.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
