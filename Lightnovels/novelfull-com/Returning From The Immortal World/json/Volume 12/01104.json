Tang Xiu let out a smile and sat on it, put a leg atop the other, and then lit a cigarette. Looking at the two men with a happy smile, he grinningly said, “You see, I don’t think there’s a need for you to know who I am for your most respected god, the Satan himself, would feel ecstatic to see you and won’t ask who has sent you to him.”</p><p>Angelo Dolan stared daggers at Tang Xiu and asked, “Is there any enmity between us?”</p><p>“The grudge is there, and the hatred is as deep as the bloody ocean.” Tang Xiu nodded. “It’s not only you, though. Those men you brought with you and all those shits in House Dolan are damned, including the ones in the SOE company under your family’s control.”</p><p>Angelo shifted his gaze to Demonfreak geezer and furiously shouted, “Demonfreak geezer, we’ve been friends and worked together for many years, why the hell did you choose to betray us?!!”</p><p>“Any good birds will choose fine trees to nestle in. My Boss has tremendous strength. He even has the means to make me stronger, so it’s a given I’m willing to pledge allegiance to him.” Demonfreak geezer grinningly said, “You know, I can get some benefits from the cooperation with your House Dolan, indeed. But comparing what I get from you and what I can get from my Boss is simply like comparing the day and night. You can only blame your bad luck, Angelo. My Boss’ men are not easy to deal with, mind you.”</p><p>Angelo was greatly shaken inwardly. Even his dreams, he never thought that Demonfreak geezer would actually address that young man as his Boss. What kind of musical stage was this? This was clearly the music of a dog licking its Master!</p><p><em>‘This is bad!’</em></p><p>Angelo realized that he was in a crisis. He only brought out a few men from his House, four of whom were his closest confidantes. Although they were very strong, they were still no match for Demonfreak geezer. Even if these four were to join hands, they would only be able to contend with the old devil evenly at best.</p><p>However, the real crisis was not this old devil but that mysterious young man and his men. They could make such the geezer who only respected the strong to submit, that only meant that their strength was above his.</p><p><em>‘What should I do? Am I going to die in this sea today?!’</em></p><p>Uneasy filled Angelo’s whole being. He turned to look at Will Art nearby and immediately had a peace of mind a lot.</p><p>Will Art himself had been silent, but he calmly observed Tang Xiu and his men. When Angelo turned to look at him, he responded with a mocking face, “Give my House Art 40% shares of Africa’s Dante diamond mine and I’ll cooperate with you to solve this immediate trouble.”</p><p>Angelo paused for a moment and then nodded. “Agreed!”</p><p>Squeezing out a smile, Will Art shot a look at Mo Awu and smilingly spoke, “I’m sure you recognize me, Old Buddy. It’s been several years since we last met, but I never thought you’ve actually chosen your Master. I sent you some people to entertain you guys in the past and created a very powerful expert out of you.”</p><p>Tang Xiu raised his brows.</p><p>“He’s Will Art, Boss.” Mo Awu respectfully said, “The training camp I used to train in before was founded by his family. As far as I know, members of House Art are very strong; their strength is almost inhuman. This Will is the first-in-line of House Art. Je has great privileges and rights and he once tried to recruit me.”</p><p>“I see.” Tang Xiu nodded. “He just said ‘you guys’. Is there anyone else among you all?”</p><p>Kuwako’s expression was a bit ugly. She once witnessed Will Art’s killing scene. It was absolutely crazy and grotesquely bloody. She was even secretly glad she didn’t stand opposite him at that time, else she’d have died already. Upon hearing Tang Xiu’s words, she paced a step forward and respectfully reported. “Sect Master, the assassin organization I once belonged to received an assassination mission where my side was initially on the same side with him. Hence, I once witnessed what he could showcase at that time. He was very strong, definitely a top expert to me then. Further, he also wanted to recruit me, though my response was perfunctory. Then I found the opportunity to return to Japan.”</p><p>Tang Xiu understood in a flash and smilingly said, “I see. This Will Art seems to be a very powerful man in your eyes previously, then. If that’s the case, then I’ll give you two solutions. But remember not to kill him, though. Maybe he can be sold for a good price.”</p><p>Mo Awu and Kuwako Yamamoto exchanged glances and immediately nodded.</p><p>Tang Xiu looked at Angelo and Will on the opposite liner and lightly smiled. “I’m only here to avenge my men. But well, I never thought I’d have the chance to make a fortune, though. This is not bad.”</p><p>Hostile eyes staring at Tang Xiu, Angelo asked in a deep tone, “I’m still not clear what kind of enmity exists between us, Mister. Besides, is there a need for you to hide anything? You must be very strong yourself since you can make Demonfreak geezer your underling. Just who are you?”</p><p>“Let’s chat since I’m still smoking, then.” Tang Xiu looked at the cigarette in his hand and found it hadn’t finished yet, so he smiled and said, “Let me tell you. I’m Tang Xiu from China. And you, Angelo Dolan, you brought your SOE company’s genetic warriors to ambush my men in Saipan. That was uncalled for. That’s why I wanna ask you, why did you bring them to intercept and ambush them?”</p><p>Angelo’s head was full of confusion. He looked at Tang Xiu with a puzzled face and asked, “Your men? Who are they? I killed a lot of people in Saipan.”</p><p>“Troubles may be avoided when trouble befalls you from Heaven, but there’s no hope for escape when you ask for it. Truly.” Tang Xiu shook his head and said, “To think that you’re like a rabid dog to ambush and kill so many people in Saipan is truly unexpected. But I’ll tell you, his name is Golden Lion—Jin Shi. Haven’t you heard about him?”</p><p>“Golden Lion?”</p><p>A scowl appeared on Angelo’s face and he growled. “So, you’re Golden Lion’s Master, huh? It seems you’re the reason he became so powerful. That’s right, I ambushed his group then. That damn asshole killed my younger brother. I hate my bastard brother, but he’s still my brother, so that guy must die.”</p><p>Tang Xiu looked surprised. He flicked the cigarette butt leisurely and clapped smilingly. “Awu, remember this guy’s words. Jin Shi killed his brother, meaning he’s scored a great contribution! Make a note to give him some rewards after we get back.”</p><p>“Understood!”</p><p>Mo Awu himself couldn’t get why Tang Xiu had such deep hatred towards House Dolan. But he didn’t ask much and just made a mental note: “House Dolan is a mortal enemy, and killing them can be rewarded!”</p><p>“I admit you’re very strong, Tang Xiu. But we’re not some fucking weak layman either!” Angelo growled. “We can go all out and perish together with you if we think we can’t survive. Only a few of you will survive even if you kill us all, so it’s better to negotiate and let go of this matter today! How about it?”</p><p>“Hmph, the bloodshed from my men can never be exchanged or traded!” Tang Xiu sneered. “When you ambushed and besieged my men, you must be prepared to be retaliated. Seems like talking is useless. KILL THEM ALL!”</p><p><em>Whoosh! Whoosh!</em></p><p>Two figures flickered lightning-fast and landed first to the liner tens of meters away—Mo Awu and Kuwako Yamamoto. They instantly unleashed their respective immortal swords. However, their target was not Angelo Dolan but Will Art.</p><p>Tang Guang and Hao Lei exchanged glances and smiled. They followed suit to rush toward the passenger ship. But one person moved faster than them—Demonfreak geezer. The old devil just tasted the sweet benefit he got from Tang Xiu today which led to his cultivation level promotion. He broke through to the late-stage of Golden Core, so he couldn’t wait to display what he could do before Tang Xiu, hoping to get more rewards. He thought… it’d be worth it if Tang Xiu rewarded him with another Sanguine Pill.</p><p>Seeing the storming figures coming toward them, Angelo and Will dashed back nearly at the same time. Tens of their men quickly replaced their positions and prepared to fight.</p><p>“This is interesting!”</p><p>Four tall men with long white hair and ruddy complexions appeared in the air around Will Art, holding strange weapons. All of which emitting chilling aura—a proof that they were slaughtering weapons.</p><p>“Interesting? My thoughts exactly!”</p><p>Two placid-faced old men with burlap shoes and octagonal hats instantly appeared from the cabin, protecting Angelo Dolan from the right and left. They were experts of House Dolan who were responsible for protecting Angelo’s safety—genetic warriors who had been injected with genetic agents many times. The present them were definitely men with copper and iron bones and lightning-fast speed and inexhaustible strength.</p><p>Tang Xiu remained calm and didn’t even flinch as these all happened. In his eyes, everyone on those two liners was nothing but dead bodies to be fed to the sharks.</p><p>He may not have much self-confidence had it been two days ago. But now was completely different since Mo Awu and the rest had their strengths promoted by leaps and bounds. Even Kuwako was now at the mid-stage of Golden Stage, while the rest had advanced to the late-stage of Golden Core. It was absolutely a breeze for them to obliterate all the enemies there. What’s more, there was still Demonfreak geezer. This geezer’s power was so tyrannical that he could kill everyone by himself.</p><p>As expected, just as the group lunged to the liners in front, they immediately launched a bloody massacre. It only took less than 10 minutes except for Angelo Dolan, Will Art, and the four old men who protected him before the rest was all slaughtered.</p><p>Disbelief was evident in Angelo’s eyes. A chill filled his whole heart. He brought more than 40 genetic warriors from SOE, all of whom possessed formidable power and could be said to be the best elites of the SOE. Yet, they couldn’t even fight back facing these people, leaving him deep dread inside.</p><p><em>‘I gotta find a way to escape!!!’</em></p><p>No matter how unwilling Angelo was, the situation forced him and he didn’t want to die.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
