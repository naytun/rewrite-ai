After putting it through, Jin Shi’s voice came out from it. “Sect Master, we captured the target and Tang An also has caught one!”</p><p>“Give them to Tang An. She knows where we are,” said Tang Xiu.</p><p>After a while, Tang An appeared in front of Tang Xiu and Chen Zhizhong, dragging the stunned Wen Feng and Guo Tao. Immediately after, Jin Shi led the four members of Tang Sect and quickly entered the room.</p><p>“Pull down the curtain and turn on the lights!” Tang Xiu ordered calmly.</p><p>Click…</p><p>As the lights in the presidential suite were turned on, Tang Xiu went to the sofa and took a seat. He looked at Wen Feng and Guo Tao and asked, “Anyway, which is Wen Feng, Zhizhong?”</p><p>“That’s him!” Chen Zhizhong pointed to Wen Feng. “I know the other man, too. He’s Guo Tao, though I didn’t expect that you actually sent people to capture both of them, Master.”</p><p>Tang Xiu looked satisfied as he shifted to Tang An and said, “Wake them up!”</p><p>The most effective way to wake someone was to beat them up. The two fainted men immediately woke up, right as the two members of Tang Sect powerfully hit them.</p><p>“Alright, stop!”</p><p>Tang Xiu lit a cigarette. As he puffed out, he looked at the two men’s vigilant faces and lightly smiled. “Well, you two are Wen Feng and Guo Tao, right? I’ve long heard your big names, you know! It’s just quite unexpected that our first meeting is under this circumstance, though.”</p><p>Wen Feng and Guo Tao exchanged glances and the former then asked, “Who are you?!”</p><p>“Ah, let’s play a game, then,” replied Tang Xiu smilingly. “If you can guess who I am, I’ll tell my man to break your leg. But if your guess is wrong, he’ll break both of them! Of course, you can also opt not to answer. But the consequence is that he’ll break all your limbs. How about it?”</p><p>Wen Feng glared at Tang Xiu in response. Then, he said in a heavy voice, “This is our first meeting, Brothers. There should be no deep hatred between us.”</p><p>“Oh, no. We do have a deep feud, I think.” Tang Xiu shook his head and said, “Didn’t you notice who is standing behind you?”</p><p>Wen Feng and Guo Tao looked at the back at the same time and their expressions turned very ugly after they saw Chen Zhizhong. They finally realized to whose hands they had fallen at this very moment. Even the former also had figured out who the person sitting in front of him was.</p><p>It was Tang Xiu! The young Divine Doctor of Chinese medicine in China, as well as the owner of the Magnificent Tang Corporation!</p><p>“Alright. I’m giving you 10 seconds, Wen Feng,” said Tang Xiu smilingly. “If you haven’t answered my question by then, you’ll get your all limbs broken and you’ll have to live like a dead dog later on. Of course, you can hope that you’ll still be alive, though.”</p><p>Wen Feng’s heart was chilled and he hurriedly blurted out, “You’re Tang Xiu!”</p><p>“Well, well. The intel agents of your Darkwind organization are really amazing!” Tang Xiu gave a thumbs up and praised. “As I recall, the contacts between me and Chen Zhizhong are but numbered over the past two years, yet I didn’t expect that you’ve been able to dig out the relation between me and him.”</p><p>Tap, tap… CRACK—</p><p>Jin Shi strode forward and stepped on Wen Feng’s left leg, then quickly returned to his place.</p><p>“AAARGH…”</p><p>Wen Feng screamed and his whole face distorted. Never did he expect the other to be so ruthless and did what he just said and directly broke his left leg.</p><p>“Well then, answer me another question,” said Tang Xiu with a chuckle. “He’ll break your arm if your answer satisfies me, but if not, you can expect to have all the remaining limbs broken too!”</p><p>Wen Feng’s heart now fell into a glacier. He had his share of seeing ruthless and merciless men, and he was also one of them. But he was now exactly the said fish on the chopping block. Under the shadow of death, he straightly kneeled down before Tang Xiu and pleaded. “Brother Tang Xiu, I should’ve known I mustn’t scheme against Chen Zhizhong, nor did I have an enmity with him. Please let me go this time and I promise to hide far from you whenever I see you later. I’ll answer all the questions you throw at me, but please don’t hurt me anymore…”</p><p>Tang Xiu raised up his brows and asked Chen Zhizhong, “Well, would you like it if he’s willing to resolve the feud between you two?”</p><p>The man in question was silent for a moment, and then slowly said, “I’m very reluctant, Master. But I’ll listen to you. If you’d like me to no longer care about it, then I won’t do so in the future.”</p><p>“I see. Then I’ll take the responsibility as your Master. Your feud with them is over now! However, Wen Feng still needs to answer some questions!”</p><p>“Please do ask. I’ll say whatever I know,” said Wen Feng honestly.</p><p>“Well, you do know that those who can play according to circumstances are all wise men, don’t you?” Tang Xiu gave him a thumbs up. “So then, who has cast the restriction seal on Chen Zhizhong’s body?”</p><p>Once again, Wen Feng’s heart turned cold. He never thought that Tang Xiu had actually correctly guessed that this matter was related to him. He hesitated for a moment, then steeled his heart and spoke, “It was Elder Wei.”</p><p>“Elder Wei? Who the heck is that?” asked Tang Xiu.</p><p>“I have no idea what his full name is.” Wen Feng shook his head and explained, “I only know that he’s the top dog in the organization, and I’m assigned as his subordinate. The reason why he acted against Chen Zhizhong is, on the one hand, I have a feud with Chen Zhizhong, while on the other hand, he wants to control him, so he can obtain medicinal herbs and the wealth of the Endless Virtue Pharmaceuticals.”</p><p>“So, is your organization the one called the Darkwind?” asked Tang Xiu again.</p><p>“That’s correct.” Wen Feng nodded. “It’s the Darkwind. And I’m in charge of two cities in China, Liangang and Peng City, whereas Guo Tao next to me is responsible for the branch in Shaanxi province.”</p><p>“Your Darkwind organization is now gathering in Liangang City and it should be for the ‘Nether Swap’ meeting occasion, right?” Tang Xiu went on, “Are all the Heads of the Darkwind’s branches in China gathered here?”</p><p>“You even know this?” Wen Feng blurted out in surprise and amazement.</p><p>“I know more than this. That’s for sure.” Tang Xiu sneered.</p><p>Wen Feng was silent for a short while. Then, he suddenly asked, “Are you an official of Chinese authority, by chance?”</p><p>A weird smile appeared on Tang Xiu’s face. “Do you really want to know that?”</p><p>Wen Feng stared blankly, then his expression slightly changed. He hastily waved and said, “Please tell me nothing, Brother Tang. I don’t wanna know. It was just my cheap mouth running wild. I shouldn’t ask what I shouldn’t.”</p><p>“That’s right. You must know less if you wanna live longer,” said Tang Xiu with a chuckle. “Anyway, tell me. Where this Elder Wei is now? Is he also in the Golden Coast?”</p><p>“That’s right. He’s indeed in the Golden Coast at the moment.” Wen Feng nodded. “Also, it’s actually impossible for me to leave at this time, but since his seal on Chen Zhizhong’s body was broken and he received a backlash, he went ballistic and drove me out to take information about you.”</p><p>The answer made Tang Xiu happily nod. “Now, the last question. If you can make me happy with your answer, you can be sure that I won’t only kill you, but also will reward you.”</p><p>“Please ask!” responded Wen Feng hurriedly.</p><p>“Who’s the one in charge of the Darkwind organization in China?” asked Tang Xiu. “Also, does he have a list of all the members of this organization in China?”</p><p>“I can’t answer this since I have no idea who the person in charge of Darkwind’s operations in China is.” Wen Feng looked bitter and shook his head. “But I think I know who can answer you.”</p><p>Tang Xiu then turned to Guo Tao.</p><p>Guo Tang sighed inwardly before speaking, “It’s Wang Sheng. He’s the chief in charge of the Darkwind operations in China. But he mysteriously appears and disappears. Unless he proactively finds me, I can only contact him through the intel network of the Darkwind at the end of the year. Additionally, the structure of the intel network changes annually, and I haven’t gotten into contact with him this year, so I don’t know where he is.”</p><p>“What about the list, then?” asked Tang Xiu in a deep voice.</p><p>“Wang Sheng is the general manager of China’s Darkwind, so he naturally holds the list of all the Darkwind’s intel operatives in China.” Guo Tao nodded and added, “I only have a list of all intel agents in Shaanxi.”</p><p>Tang Xiu was very satisfied with their answers. Although he already knew that both of them were ruthless and brutal men, they also feared death. They would never be loyal to the Darkwind organization when being faced with death itself. Loyalty to the organization was absolutely not worth losing their lives.</p><p>Thus, they would definitely be able to play some good roles if he were to make good use of such people.</p><p>“Alrighty. Jin Shi, heal his leg!” Tang Xiu ordered.</p><p>Jin Shi quickly complied and strode towards Wen Feng. He grabbed his bare feet and connected his leg bones. Amid the man’s screeching screams, he used his True Essence energy to nourish the man’s broken bones and slowly said, “Don’t use your left leg for 10 days.”</p><p>Wen Feng was ecstatic as he finally realized that Tang Xiu wouldn’t kill him at all, else he would’ve never let his man carry out such unnecessary action to heal himself.</p><p>“What else do you wanna know, Boss Tang? I’ll tell you everything I know!”</p><p>“Yeah, me too!” blurted Guo Tao in a muffled voice.</p><p>“I’ve already asked everything I wanted to know, and I’m happy with your answers.” Tang Xiu smilingly said, “But if I’m going easy with you, though, you’re gonna kick me into troublesome issues once you ran back to the Golden Coast and tell the Darkwind’s people about me. So, you two will still need to accept my condition. You can leave if you accept it.”</p><p>“We’ll comply with any conditions!”</p><p>“I’ll comply too!”</p><p>Both answered at the same time.</p><p>Tang Xiu instantly seized Wen Feng’s and Guo Tao’s shoulders. After he cast the Soul Ruling Spell on the two men, he then spoke with satisfaction, “I have cast a seal on you. My restriction seal is 100 times stronger than the one old ghost Wei cast. So to say, your lives will be in my hands from now on, and you two will die without a burial place with just a thought of mine.”</p><p>Wen Feng and Guo Tao exchanged dismayed glances and looked at a loss. They were already well aware that Tang Xiu wouldn’t just let them go that easily. They could feel a dark and faint sensation that let them know that Tang Xiu didn’t tell lie. Their lives were indeed in his hands.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
