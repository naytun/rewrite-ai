Now that he had confirmed it himself, it made her heart completely fall to the ditch. Ever since she was taken into the bed of the Palace Master, she had been severely warned that she could provoke any practitioners from the Western cultivation world and anywhere else, save from Chinese cultivators and the Buddhist schools.</p><p>The Joyous supernatural power had been helping her to constantly improve in the last 80 years. She kept getting stronger and thus, began casting away the Palace Master’s warning. But now, she finally experienced how powerful a cultivator was first hand. She was also finally crystal clear that Kuwako’s backer turned out to be some cultivators from China.</p><p>To live? Or to die? Or wish to die but be unable to?</p><p>Facing these three options, Yuji finally cast away all her hesitations and directly said, “I’ll tell you everything you want to know. My only hope is to leave Japan or better, Asia, after I do that.”</p><p>“You don’t have the leverage to ask anything.” Tang Xiu shook his head. “Besides, wouldn’t you have gone already if you can just fly off to some faraway place?”</p><p>“How did you know that?” Yuji’s expression changed.</p><p>“Heh, there must be someone in that Joyous Palace you fear.” Tang Xiu sneered. “I’m sure he can find you easily. It’s very likely that you can never escape from him even if you run away to the ends of the earth, whereas you’ll also face endless chase should you reveal anything about this person.”</p><p>Yuji fell into silence as she knew that Tang Xiu was just telling the facts. The Miyaji of the palace did have strange supernatural power. Once she betrayed him and no matter where she ran away, he had the means to find her. He didn’t even have to move in person. She could expect to have numerous assassins from Joyous Palace hot on her tails until they killed her. Another possibility was the Miyaji himself would act. But her end wouldn’t be that simple and would be very likely to be at the border of life and death as well.</p><p>“You may be strong, but you’re just like an ant to me,” said Tang Xiu calmly. “Comply with my demand and you can expect that not only can I save your life, but also preserve your cultivation.”</p><p>“That’s impossible.” Yuji shook her head. “My injuries are too heavy and have seriously damaged my physique. Not even immortals can heal me. The only best ending I can hope for is to use the soul secret art to capture someone’s body that fits for my soul to possess. However, the chance is very low. And it’s likely that it’d be very difficult to cultivate anymore.”</p><p>Noticing her unwillingness, Tang Xiu immediately took out a bottle of Holy Healing pills from the interspatial ring and quickly stuffed one into her mouth. He then carefully picked her up and examined the wounds all over her body. He immediately took her to the bathroom and filled the bathtub with warm water and dripped a drop of Body Tempering Liquid into it, saying, “I believe you’ve felt the Holy Healing pill working on you. Soak yourself in this warm water for half an hour. You’ll live and even obtain great benefits. Now, tell me, are you willing to work for me?”</p><p>Yuji’s heart hiked up after realizing that Chinese cultivators had many mysterious magical powers. She had experienced first hand and might have other effects on her as well, so she immediately replied, “I’m willing.”</p><p>Tang Xiu threw her into the tub and quickly unsealed her from the restrictions. Then, he spoke in a deep voice, “Those who work for me will thrive, and those against must die. You should be clear about the consequence of betrayal. Also, persist and bear the enormous pain you’ll face next. The longer you can persist, the better the benefits you’ll get. I’ll be waiting for you outside.”</p><p>Having said that, he went straight out of the bathroom. Yuji’s naked body didn’t interest him in the slightest as her body was even worse than a prostitute to him.</p><p>“Aaargh…”</p><p>Heartbreaking screams came from the bathroom in the back, but Tang Xiu just ignored it. Even those who were uninjured would feel the suffering and pain from Body Tempering Liquid, even wishing to die because of it. In Yuji’s case, she had many injuries, and many of them touched her internal organs. Thus, the pain caused by the Body Tempering Liquid would definitely be ten times more than felt by the average people.</p><p>Half an hour passed by. Tang Xiu had covered Shaofang’s venue with an array. The array itself didn’t have great offensive power, but it was very strong in defense. Be it from the interior or outside, nobody could easily break it and rush out if they didn’t understand the array.</p><p>It was a contingency. He may be formidable enough to even defeat those at the Spirit Formation Stage, but if she planned to escape and also had some escaping technique, he didn’t have 100% assurance that he could force her to stay.</p><p>After arranging the array, Tang Xiu came to the place where Osashi Kitagishi was detained. The man told him everything he knew in just ten seconds, literally everything. He even blurted out all his ideas and guesses.</p><p>However, Tang Xiu didn’t spare him and killed him directly.</p><p>Early in the morning when the first sunshine rose from the East, Yuji, now in clean clothes, walked out of the room and came to the courtyard. After seeing Tang Xiu sitting cross-legged on the bluestone, a chilling light flashed in her eyes.</p><p>“What’s your name, Sir?”</p><p>This time, she didn’t speak English but asked in fluent Mandarin.</p><p>Tang Xiu glanced at her and lightly answered, “Tang Xiu.”</p><p>“You’re very powerful, Mr. Tang.” Yuji smiled and said, “You’re the most powerful person I’ve ever seen aside from Palace Master. Also, I feel much better now. I’ve never been better, in fact. That’s why I feel like asking Mr. Tang to enlighten me in a spar.”</p><p>Did she challenge me?</p><p>Disdain flitted across Tang Xiu’s eyes as he coolly said, “Your injuries are just impossible to heal this fast even though you have taken the Holy Healing pill and the Body Tempering Liquid. The sensation you’re feeling is due to having your body improved for some reason. You’re completely mistaken if you really think you can challenge me now.”</p><p>Yuji’s expression changed, but then it was instantly restored to a smiling one as she chuckled. “Mr. Tang, the Japanese always hold respect for the strong. I think that’s the reason Kuwako is lowering herself to serve you, to begin with. You want me to be your subordinate, so you must make me submit completely.”</p><p>“Let me do it, Sect Master.”</p><p>Mo Awu interjected said with a respectful face.</p><p>“Nah, she chose to challenge me, so I’ll give her that.” Tang Xiu shook his head. “Awu, your physique is in good condition today, so let me teach you something. You can also defeat the enemy with your formidable body even though your cultivation is slightly weaker.”</p><p>Having said that, Tang Xiu instantly appeared in front of Yuji and sent her punches without any flashy movements. But his punches were very fast and hit the woman’s belly in nearly an instant. Then, he floated up and sent hundreds of kicks in a second, tens of which hit Yuji’s body.</p><p>The scene was like a showering gale, frantic and crazily berserk.</p><p>Yuji may feel that she was in a great state and realized that Tang Xiu’s strength was very strong, but it never occurred to her that the gap between them was so great.</p><p>Sparring was not a fight where the fighters had to fight with all they had at all. Thus, it was very difficult to unleash their most powerful attack as they must be careful not to kill the opponent. She thought that Tang Xiu’s strike yesterday with the sword was his most powerful strike, so he wouldn’t be able to do much without it even though he was very powerful.</p><p>However, the constant blows her body was suffering under right now proved that she was completely mistaken.</p><p>“I yield!”</p><p>In less than half a minute, Yuji, who screamed many times already due to the barrage of punches, couldn’t help but shout aloud, begging for mercy.</p><p>Tang Xiu ceased attacking and returned to the bluestone and sat cross-legged. He then looked at the distressed Yuji. There was blood flowing from her mouth now. Then, he spoke, “I got the intention to recruit you, so I didn’t crush you yesterday. You’re asking for trouble now, so I’m simply helping you.”</p><p>Yuji wiped the blood off the corner of her mouth and looked at Tang Xiu with especially bright eyes. Staggeringly walking forward, she came to Tang Xiu’s forward, knelt and said, “Thank you for not killing me. You’re indeed very strong, but the gap between you and Miyaji is still like a chasm, while the Joyous Palace still also has lots of experts. You won’t be able to fight against them given your strength. Kuwako Yamamoto is nothing but an insignificant person. She can’t even enter the top 30 people in Joyous Palace with her cultivation. Therefore, please take her and leave Japan immediately! Don’t worry. I won’t reveal your secrets!”</p><p>Having said that, her feet trampled the ground and streaked away to the distance like a bolt. Her speed was extremely fast and took just a blink of the eye as she had already appeared in the vicinity outside Shaofang.</p><p>“Nobody pursuing, huh?”</p><p>Feeling excited, a beautiful smile appeared on Yuji’s pretty face. Just a second later, however, her smile directly frozen solid.</p><p>BANG…</p><p>A transparent energy shield suddenly emerged and pain struck Yuji while her body was sent flying upside-down instantly. Fortunately, she had good reflexes and was very sensitive to movements. Therefore, she didn’t fall to the ground.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>A few figures appeared around her, but none attacked her. Yet, each and every one of them wore a strange smirk while looking at her distressed appearance.</p><p>Xue Sha stroked his chin and let out an odd grin. “Yo, belle. Sect Master arranged this array himself. Multiply your power several times more and you can expect to still fail on cracking and leave this array. Just try if you don’t buy it, though. I hope you don’t end up crying later and ask for mercy before my Sovereign.”</p><p>An array?!!</p><p>Yuji turned pale. She knew the might the array could unleash because her Master, the princess of the Joyous Palace, was also proficient in arrays, some of which made her frightened.</p><p>“BREAK!!!”</p><p>She didn’t accept it and bombarded the energy shield, only to find that the shield swayed and rippled before returning to normal. However, it was enough to make her shaken and retreat.</p><p>Tang Guang didn’t speak but directly threw her a sharp sword.</p><p>Yuji held her breath and received the sword. Sword images then swayed and attacked the energy shield in front of her. However, all her efforts were futile. She couldn’t break the array, nor did she have any means to run away.</p><p>Finally, Yuji returned to Tang Xiu with fearful, profound respect and humility. Without any more tricks, she honestly knelt down.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
