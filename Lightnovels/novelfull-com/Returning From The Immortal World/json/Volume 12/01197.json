Neatly arranged rows of cabinets were placed in the small half area of the place, while gold bars the size of bricks neatly piled up high next to it. Despite having seen a large amount of gold before, the scene really gave Tang Xiu quite the surprise.</p><p><em>These gold bars are at least over 100 tons.</em></p><p>He secretly estimated the amount and thought that his estimation likely wouldn’t quite far off.</p><p>On either side of the row of shelves were piles of silver. Tang Xiu’s rough estimation counted that the number of these fist-sized silver ingots was no less than those gold bars, but the most important thing here was a large number of beautifully carved silverware that were piled with it. On the other side was a massive amount of gold, silver, and pearl jewelry. Tang Xiu released his spiritual sense and was shocked by the number of diamonds he found in the piles.</p><p>Mo Awu noticed his stunned expression and happily said, “Does the scene give you a shock, Sect Master? We got our share too when we first entered this place. The enemy this time can definitely be called filthy rich with so much wealth here. I just don’t get it. From where did that Joyous Palace Master obtain so much wealth?”</p><p>Tang Xiu took a deep breath and turned to look at him, asking, “Do you know the fastest way to get so much wealth in the world?”</p><p>“Um… open a bank?” answered Mo Awu after thinking for a moment.</p><p>Tang Xiu rolled his eyes at him and was about to explain when he suddenly heard the elevator door open. Then, Yuji’s voice sounded. “The fastest means to get such wealth in the world is to be a bandit. Raiding and plundering homes are nothing, but robbing those rich people is the best course. The Joyous Palace existed for decades and looted those tens of rich Japanese. It also set up a large number of companies here, with over 30 of them now being listed companies. It’s just unfortunate that we have no access to Dragon Vanquisher Sage’s account, else Boss would’ve been propelled up into the top ranks of the richest people in the world.”</p><p>Tang Xiu glanced at her and lightly said, “Men must learn to be content with what they get. These gold, silver, and jewelry are already a good harvest, but those banks got a pie falling from the sky from that monk’s money, indeed.”</p><p>“Anyway, I’m the one who cracked the Joyous Palace’s array, Boss, else they would have been still outside trying to destroy the array! How are you going to reward me for such a great contribution?”</p><p>Tang Xiu walked towards her and watched her smiling face. A smile sketched on his face and asked, “What reward do you want, then?”</p><p>Yuji’s heart went cold and she hurriedly bowed. “It was a joke, Boss. Yuji won’t dare to object even if you don’t reward me anything.”</p><p>“Hmph.” Tang Xiu snorted and indifferently said, “The smart and the wise never ask for a reward. But you did have done well, so a reward is due. But you asked me about it, so I will tell you that the reward you’re going to get is pills.”</p><p>After saying that, Tang Xiu took out two bottles of pills from his interspatial ring and threw them to her. “These pills will help your cultivation go a level further.”</p><p>Looking ecstatic, Yuji hurriedly bowed with a grateful face. “Thanks a lot, Boss.”</p><p>“En!”</p><p>Tang Xiu turned around and headed to the interior. He found some peculiarities from some of those gold bars back when he released his spiritual sense. He guessed that some of them likely contained gold essence.</p><p>Mo Awu approached Yuji and glanced at Tang Xiu’s back as he walked away. After taking back his vision, he patted Yuji’s shoulder and said in a low voice, “I hope you take today’s lesson well and be smarter in the future.”</p><p>Having said that, he quickly left to catch up with Tang Xiu.</p><p>Yuji was stunned and looked confused. <em>How could it be a lesson? Didn’t he give me a reward already?</em></p><p>After giving it a thought, she quickly sped up to catch up with Mo Awu and asked in a whisper, “What did you mean by saying that?”</p><p>Mo Awu lightly smiled and replied with a voice that only both of them could hear, “You’re not yet a formal Tang Sect disciple, so you have no idea what Boss usually does when he rewards everyone’s merits. Your contribution this time is great, so I’ll tell you a bit. With your contributions this time, the amount you could’ve gotten is likely ten times more than what you just received had you not proactively asked the reward from Boss.”</p><p>“Over ten times, you say?” Yuji blurted out with disbelief and contracted pupils.</p><p>Mo Awu went on to mock her. “The Chinese have conventional wisdom that one would get smarter after falling into a pit, though. Just take it and keep this lesson in mind.”</p><p>Yuji’s expression constantly changed and deep regret finally appeared on her face. That was ten times the number of pills she just received! Her cultivation could have improved much further and become much stronger in a short time had she gotten those pills!</p><p>Suddenly, she seemed to recall something else and caught up with Mo Awu again and asked in a whisper, “Tell me, are there a lot more chances to render merits in Tang Sect?”</p><p>Mo Awu shook his head. “Sect Master told me that Earth is a peaceful world. There may be some disputes and clashes, but it’s just that and far from… some other places. Therefore, some disciples must wait for a long while before they can render some merits. No worries, though. As long as you’re successful in passing the trial Sect Master gave you and become an official disciple of the sect, you’ll obtain the allotted cultivation resources annually. Additionally, you can also purchase other resources, such as precious herbs, ores, or fierce beasts’ parts and bones somewhere else, and then exchange them for the pills from the sect.”</p><p>Yuji’s regret dissipated a lot after hearing the explanation. She had money and could be said to be filthy rich herself. Some industries under her control over the years could bring her huge profits annually, which she had been keeping a secret after she joined the Joyous Palace.</p><p>At the gold piles spot.</p><p>Tang Xiu took some gold bars. These gold bars had undergone smelting, but the gold essence contained in it was still intact. After giving it some thought, he then decided to stuff all the gold, silver, jewelry, and other goods in the third basement floor into his interspatial ring.</p><p>Several minutes later, Yuji dumbfoundedly looked around at the now-empty third basement floor. The shock in her heart was indescribable. The then Joyous Palace Master, Dragon Vanquisher Sage, once obtained some interspatial storage artifacts like that, which he obtained from some vestiges with great luck. She heard the biggest space those interspatial artifacts had was about the size of a room, only a trivial several square meters.</p><p>But now, Tang Xiu actually stuffed all the piles of gold, silver and everything else in the third basement floor into his storage artifact? How big could the space inside it be? Didn’t that mean that its space was tens of times bigger than those few artifacts possessed by Dragon Vanquisher Sage?</p><p>Tang Xiu didn’t want to waste time in any thoughts and feelings. This place was not his territory and he had taken everything that could be brought and thus, was against staying any longer. When the elevator stopped on the second basement floor, he went out and found a lot of antiques, precious ores, and fierce beasts’ bones.</p><p>“Umm?”</p><p>His figure flashed and instantly appeared in front of the wall tens of meters away. He looked at the complete skeleton of a certain fierce beast on the floor with a surprised look. He chanted a secret art and, as it fell on what was supposed to be the beast’s chest bones, a tens of centimeters golden bone suddenly floated out from the inside and appeared before his eyes.</p><p>“A bone finger of an Immortal Beast?”</p><p>He could sense the enormous immortal power contained in this bone finger. He realized that if he could exploit this bone properly, not only could he enhance his physical strength by several times, but also increase his cultivation by a large margin.</p><p>This place was simply fully littered with treasures. Just randomly taking one of them and sold it outside would fetch a sky-high price. But to Tang Xiu, the rest of the treasures including those gold and silver from the third floor were not as valuable as this piece of bone.</p><p>Shortly after, he also stuffed all the goods here into the interspatial ring and then headed to the first basement floor. It was rather unexpected to him that the Joyous Palace turned out to have hoarded a massive amount of precious herbs. They even stored tens of Millennium Wild Ginseng here.</p><p>After leaving the underground space, Tang Xiu toured the entire isolated island accompanied by Mo Awu and Yuji. He then learned that Mo Awu’s group had looted nearly all the valuable things in the site. He even saw Mo Awu put out the bed usually used by Dragon Vanquisher Sage to sleep from his interspatial ring. It was because that bed was fully made of Golden Silkwood Cedar.</p><p>“I saved this one for you, Sect Master.”</p><p>Mo Awu apparently didn’t want to give Tang Xiu the stuff he had looted, but there was something he didn’t dare to keep, which was a translucent carved chair made of ice jade.</p><p>“That’s some great stuff you got there.” Tang Xiu was surprised.</p><p>“Indeed.” Mo Awu smilingly replied, “That’s why this subordinate doesn’t dare to keep it.”</p><p>Tang Xiu patted his shoulder and smilingly said, “Take these Soul Accruing Pills. It took me tons of precious herbs to barely concoct four pills before. Quickly take one now. Then take another when you return to Nine Dragons and go into seclusion to cultivate.”</p><p>Mo Awu jolted inwardly and hurriedly asked, “Sect Master, the effect of this Soul Accruing Pill is…”</p><p>“Your spiritual sense will be greatly enhanced if you take this Soul Accruing Pill,” Tang Xiu answered with a smile. “Taking it will at least improve your spiritual sense to be on par with the spiritual sense possessed by those peak Nascent Soul experts.”</p><p><em>Gasp…</em></p><p>Mo Awu couldn’t help but draw in cold air. His strength had been improving rapidly, but the improvement of his spiritual sense was much slower. His spiritual sense was even much weaker than his younger brother, Mo Awen. Therefore, what he had been eager to find was not pills to increase his cultivation at the present, but rather this type of pill that could enhance his spiritual sense!</p><p>“Sect Master…”</p><p>Mo Awu was greatly touched and opened his mouth but he swallowed back the grateful words.</p><p><em>A devoted and loyal retainer would die for his Master.</em></p><p>Only at this moment did Mo Awu finally realize the meaning of this sentence. He knew he wouldn’t bat an eye even if Tang Xiu ordered him to die at this moment.</p><p>Tang Xiu patted his shoulder again and smilingly said, “Keep cultivating well. It’s my hope that you will always be my Senior General.”</p><p>At the side, Yuji had been listening to their conversation and was so envious. She was also a cultivator, so how could she not understand how precious this Soul Accruing Pill was? Her power was very likely to soar greatly if it was she who obtained this pill.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
