How come Gu Changmin jumped out at this time to support that young man? Who exactly is this guy?”</p><p>“Does it make sense? Has Gu Changmin lost his mind or something?! He said whoever stands up this time to bid will take him as an enemy? That’s equal to having everyone present as enemies! He’s a businessman, for God’s sake. Isn’t he afraid of offending all the rich people in Shanghai and from nearby cities?”</p><p>“Something doesn’t add up here. What exactly is the origin of this young man? To think that he can actually have Gu Changmin’s support? Is he Gu Changmin’s illegitimate child or something?”</p><p>“There’s gotta be some demons at work when such queer thing like this happens. I know that flying disk is kind of special, but to think that someone would directly jump to take it for himself when nobody started bidding for it is unexpected.”</p><p>“Let’s see where this is heading. It’s not like I’m afraid of Gu Changmin’s declaration.”</p><p>“…”</p><p>The old man sitting in the second row looked angry. He knew Gu Changmin and was on good terms with him a bit. But he didn’t expect that the man would jump out and stand up for this arrogant young man at this time.</p><p><em>What the hell is he doing? Does he really want to take me as his enemy or something?</em></p><p>Even if Gu Changmin and his Dingshen Media were powerful, he was not weak either. He could also make use of his own wealth and connections and was absolutely capable of pressing back.</p><p>“Boss Gu, I hope you know what you’re doing. This brat is clearly on the opposite side of everyone else here. For you jump out to stand up for him, do you really want to tear all the decorum with everyone present?” asked the old man indifferently after pondering for a short while.</p><p>Gu Changmin shot a look at Tang Xiu and slowly replied, “I already said that whoever takes him as an enemy will have to take me on as well. He wants that object, so nobody can take it from him today.”</p><p>The old man abruptly got up and chillingly said, “You’re not qualified to even speak like that, Gu Changmin! This flying disk is a great object, that’s for sure. Everyone here knows that clearly. Are you colluding with him to possess such a great thing for yourself?”</p><p>At this moment, Jin Xingkui directly got up and indifferently said, “If Gu Changmin alone doesn’t have the qualification, then put me into the tab. This Jin Xingkui may not be a powerful man, but I stand up on this matter. Anyone who dares to snatch that Avion stuff with him will take me as his enemy too!”</p><p>Ji Mu shot an admiring gaze at Tang Xiu and immediately got up, shouting his piece, “Then also add the Ji Family of Changxi! Whoever dares to take him as the enemy will have to take the Jis as an adversary as well. My family may be nothing in Shanghai, but I do believe we still got what it takes to crunch some hard bones if necessary.”</p><p>Ouyang Lulu followed suit and apathetically said, “And count the Ouyangs of Jingmen Island as well!”</p><p>The old lady, Zui Ying, also added with a faint smile, “This old lady has never left the Northern region for many years and hardly knows how my boys at home have been dealing with the family’s businesses all this while. But you can have my word that those who take Mr. Tang as their enemies will have to face the Shen Family of the Northern region.”</p><p>Disbelief, horrified, and incredulous expressions were evident on the faces of everyone present in the venue as they watched these people who stood up.</p><p>Jin Xingkui, the owner of Jinda Estate?</p><p>The Boss of Dingshen Media, Gu Changmin?</p><p>The Ji Family of Changxi?</p><p>House Ouyang of Jingmen Island?</p><p>And the famous and illustrious Shen Family from the Northern region?!</p><p>At that instant, everyone present was puzzled and confused. Never in their wildest dreams did they think things would develop into this situation. Who exactly was this distinguished bigwig? To think that so many prominent families and big bosses would support him without hesitation?</p><p>In the second-row seats, the old man’s expression turned extremely ugly and disbelief was truly reflecting his feelings. It was a situation he never expected to happen.</p><p>Suddenly, a loud voice came from the back row of the venue, “The person on that auction stage is Brother Tang whom I, Miao Wentang, have sworn with as life-and-death brothers! Whoever dares to fight him will become the mortal enemy of the Miaos of Haiqing Province!”</p><p>A few seconds passed by and another voice sounded, “I don’t know who the little brother on the auction floor is, but Ms. Ouyang of the Jingmen Island’s House Ouyang is my sister-in-law. Those who make her unhappy will also make House Tang of Beijing unhappy.”</p><p>The Miao Family of Haiqing Province?</p><p>And… Beijing’s… Tang Family?!!</p><p>Instantly, over 200 guests who came to the auction venue felt dizzy by the identity of these two people. The Miaos of Haiqing were still fine. They may have big power but hardly sent any dread to their hearts. But House Tang in the capital… was a very different story. It was literally a colossus! Who could possibly dare to offend them?</p><p>On the auction stage, Tang Xiu himself didn’t expect that Miao Wentang actually came to this place. But the one surprised him the most was that Tang Wei kiddo, who even came here, but sitting very low-key in the last row with an elegant young lady as a companion.</p><p>Tang Xiu let out a faint smile and said, “I’m grateful to so many people for supporting me, but I can deal with today’s matter by myself. Please have a seat again, everyone. There’s something I’d like to say.”</p><p>As everyone sat down, Tang Xiu shot a glance to the back and indifferently said, “Although I don’t know who the organizer of this auction is, you should have been watching the situation unfold here. I hope you can stand up to answer some questions.”</p><p>In a second, the venue turned deathly still. Everyone looked around, wanting to see who the organizer of this action really was.</p><p><em>Cough, cough…</em></p><p>An old man in a Chinese tunic suit and wearing reading glasses, who sat on the tenth row of the venue, got up and lightly smiled. “This little brother is surnamed Tang, isn’t it? Are you perhaps someone from House Tang of Beijing?”</p><p>“Who I am is not necessarily important. What’s important is your name,” replied Tang Xiu lightly.</p><p>That old man slowly left his seat and walked to Tang Xiu on the auction stage. After he came before Tang Xiu, he carefully observed the latter and smilingly said, “The surname is Mei, as in Mei for the blossoming Plum Flowers character. You can address me as Elder Wei.”</p><p>“How to address you is my own business as I demand you to answer me a few questions,” said Tang Xiu apathetically. “Else, you can expect to have bad luck to befall upon you, including the influence backing you up!”</p><p>The old man’s smiling face froze. He squinted and asked, “And if I don’t buy it?”</p><p>Tang Xiu fished out his cell phone and dialed a certain number. After his call was picked up by the other party, he began speaking in a deep voice, “Something happened in the Blue Starfish Mansion. I’d like you to send your men to blockade the establishment within half an hour. Also, seal off any means of communication to the outside world at the fastest speed possible!”</p><p>“Copy that!” a deep voice belonging to Duanmu Lin replied from the mobile phone.</p><p>Tang Xiu hung up and his eyes moved back to the old man, whose expression was now slightly changed. Then, he shouted in a heavy voice, “Hu Shaokun, come out now!”</p><p>Hu Shaokun had been staying in the auction venue from the beginning but stayed low-key among the crowd. He heard Tang Xiu’s voice and knew what his real identity was, so he hurriedly stood up and forced a smile. “Uh, Tang… umm, anything you want to tell me?”</p><p>“Notice all the security guards of the Blue Starfish Mansion seal off all the exits of this island at once!” Tang Xiu said in a deep voice. “I give you the right to do so, and you’re allowed to kill anyone who dares to leave directly!”</p><p>“Ugh!” Hu Shaokun’s complexion changed and he hesitantly said, “That’s not good… they are all…”</p><p>“I don’t care in the slightest of what kind of people they are,” replied Tang Xiu in a heavy voice. “If you don’t want to be charged as an insurgent for treason later, immediately carry out what I just told you!”</p><p>Treason… insurgents?!</p><p>Hu Shaokun was trembling. He never doubted Tang Xiu’s ability to do so. After all, House Tang was behind him, and it was hard to predict what this House could do.</p><p>Immediately after, he quickly grabbed his phone to dial a number and shouted in a heavy voice, “Notice all the security guards to immediately seal off the entire Blue Starfish Mansion! Seal every exit passage on the island and allow no one to leave, no one! Whoever dares to resist… you’re authorized to kill!”</p><p>At this moment, everyone was truly shocked. The “treason” emphasized by Tang Xiu frightened them. Only then did they realize that Tang Xiu’s identity was very likely to be very terrifying. Else, it was impossible for the owner of the Blue Starfish Mansion to be so afraid of him.</p><p>Who is he?</p><p>Who in the world is he exactly?</p><p>The old in the second row suddenly stood up and shouted, “What you did is a bit too much, youngster Tang! We may still consider this issue amicably if you can show us some reliable identity, yet you threaten us and even limit our freedom. This is literally a grave crime!”</p><p>“A felony, huh?” sneered Tang Xiu. “Whether it’s true or not, what you say still doesn’t count for I… have the final say!”</p><p>Having said that, he took out the green book from the interspatial ring and shoved it on the old man Mei’s face and asked in a cold tone, “Now, answer me the first question, who entrusted you to auction this Aeroglider at this auction?”</p><p>The old man’s pupils shrunk and he looked bitter. He shook his head and said, “That person demanded his name to be confidential and we didn’t investigate his identity at all. But he’s a young man of around 27 years old with tanned skin and smells like… a soldier.”</p><p>Smells like a soldier?</p><p>Tang Xiu immediately realized the issue the moment he heard it. He took a deep breath and asked again, “Who are all those who have touched this Aeroglider? Summon them here. Can you do it?”</p><p>“I can arrange it at once,” replied Elder Mei with a forced smile.</p><p>In just a few minutes, the over 200 guests could finally tell how grave the issue was. Many of those braver took out their mobile phones and prepared to make a call to pass the matter out, trying to protect themselves. The incident unfolding today was strange to the extreme, but they had to face it seriously now.</p><p>“What exactly is going on? How come my phone doesn’t work at all?”</p><p>“No signal? He just said that he wanted someone to seal off any signal here. It really got blocked already?”</p><p>“Who in the world is he? Who has such a great ability to even make the communication department to block the signals here?”</p><p>“Dammit! Are we really trapped here?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
