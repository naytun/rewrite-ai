But, he’s only 8 years old now! An 8 years old boy, what aspect does he have to make him worth cultivating?</em></p><p>Tang Xiu watched Li Yuquan with a tranquil face and lightly said, “I know you have concerns in mind. You think that I’m training your son as a threat to bind you to me. If you do have such a thought, you can scram now since your ability isn’t even worth it in my eyes.”</p><p>At this time, Tang Xiu glanced around. There were only two members of the Special Abilities Bureau, himself, Jin Shi, and Wolf Head next to the two cars. Tang Xiu instantly grabbed Li Yuquan’s arm with speed like a bolt of lightning. In just the blink of an eye, he had already dragged Li Yuquan and appeared in front of Jin Shi and Wolf Head.</p><p>“What?!!”</p><p>The sudden change scared Li Yuquan out of his wits. He felt Tang Xiu release his arm and immediately raised his hand to rub his eyes and even fiercely pinched his own waist.</p><p><em>This is not an illusion and I’m not dreaming? This…</em></p><p>Tang Xiu took a seat in the car and looked at the dumbfounded Li Yuquan outside, lightly saying, “Now you understand what I mean, don’t you? You’re just one weak man who’s worth cultivating in my eyes. But weak people like you are countless in this world, so you’re not worthy of threatening by taking your son, to begin with.”</p><p>The car started and Li Yuquan looked as the car began to move forward. Turning his head to the faintly smiling Wolf Head with difficulty, Wolf Head said lightly, “You should be happy and not suspect the Boss’ intention, you know. Only a handful few made him interested, so you need to cherish this chance for you and your son.”</p><p>Li Yuquan could feel his heart accelerating. It was like the sound of muffled thunder. He suddenly seemed to realize something and turned to Wolf Head, asking, “How do you know that Boss wants to cultivate my son?”</p><p>Wolf Head rolled his eyes at his question and went to the driver’s seat. Then, he lightly said, “Boss’ voice was not that loud, but I could still hear it from here, got that? But then, I forgot to tell you that my hearing is at least ten times the average person.”</p><p><em>He just heard it? It was tens of meters away, yet Wolf Head could hear it clearly?</em></p><p>Li Yuquan quickly drilled into the front seat and saw Wolf Head started the car, so he quickly asked, “What and who exactly are you guys?”</p><p>“We’re from the Tang Sect,” said Wolf Head indifferently.</p><p>“Tang Sect? What the heck is that?” asked Li Yuquan once again.</p><p>Pride could be seen on Wolf Head’s face as he emphasized every word of his reply, “It’s a sect consisted of cultivators. If you want to be an outer member of the sect, you need to pay by accomplishing a lot of missions first. Only then will you have the qualification to become a disciple.”</p><p><em>Cultivators?</em></p><p>Li Yuquan was not an average person with no experience in this aspect. He was the former leader of the Blue Eagle special force and thus, knew a lot of secrets. Even when he carried out his mission overseas, he ran into various ability users and cultivators.</p><p><em>Unexpectedly, they are… cultivators—all of them?</em></p><p>He suppressed the excitement that threatened to overwhelm him and asked again quickly, “Then what’s Boss Tang’s status in the Tang Sect? Am I one of its disciples now?”</p><p>Wolf Head couldn’t help but burst into laughter. He rolled his eyes at Li Yuquan and snappily said, “Are you dreaming or what? Even if Sect Master is willing to take you as his subordinate, you can only become an outer member, no less! You can only enter the inner circle after accomplishing major merits.”</p><p>“Huh?” Li Yuquan wore a disbelieving face and asked, “Boss Tang is actually Tang Sect’s Sovereign?”</p><p>With deep respect on his face, Wolf Head nodded. “Boss created the sect himself, so he’s naturally the Sect Master. But let me give you a piece of advice before you formally enter the inner court. Absolute obedience in carrying out orders is a must when carrying out missions in the outer court. The Sect may have few rules, but the distinction between status is very clear. You must give anyone from the inner court their due respect whenever you meet them and act humbly should you see any Elders. You bet that even I must act respectfully before those inner court Elders.”</p><p>“How many disciples does the Tang Sect has, though? And how many outer disciples there are?” asked Li Yuquan.</p><p>Wolf Head glanced at him and slowly answered, “That’s the sect’s secret, I can’t tell you anything. But let me warn you in advance. You may meet some people in the sect who used to be your enemies in the past. Some you may be familiar with and even has deep hatred. But you must cast away all those past feuds with them from now on, while treating them as your closest comrades, like brothers and sisters, or even your own family. The biggest merit of the Tang Sect is that every disciple of the sect will give up his or her life for the other disciples if necessary.”</p><p>“I don’t think I have enemies, nor have I ever any feud with others, though.” Li Yuquan shook his head.</p><p>“Heh, that’s what you say. Jin Shi doesn’t look familiar to you?” Wolf Head sneered.</p><p>Li Yuquan thought for a while and answered, “I did feel that he’s a bit familiar the first time I met him. But I can’t recall where I saw him before.”</p><p>“Does the Bloodthirsty Golden Lion ring any bells? The one who massacred everyone in a captured city in Africa?” asked Wolf Head lightly.</p><p>Li Yuquan’s eyes nearly popped out instantly after hearing this. He gasped and exclaimed, “He’s <em>that</em> Bloodthirsty Golden Lion? The butcher who carried the bloodbath of hundreds or so arm dealers in a certain city?”</p><p>“You call him a butcher, huh?” Wolf Head scoffed and smilingly continued, “That’s because you haven’t met the more ruthless disciples in the sect. Let’s save it for later. I’m hoping you can become the latest inner disciple so you can follow Spectre later.”</p><p>“Spectre? As in <em>that</em> lunatic Spectre?” Li Yuquan’s face was now devoid of color as he screamed out yet again.</p><p>“If you dare to call him a lunatic right before his face, he’ll definitely drill you in the training really good for three days straight. Those children soldiers who got trained by him for three days nearly lost a few layers of their skins. Well, you’re not as good as them, though.”</p><p>Li Yuquan’s lips wriggled a few times. His shock went through the roof.</p><p>It was Spectre—the number one assassin in the world!</p><p>The man was simply the devil incarnation in many people’s eyes. Even the most powerful bigwigs in various countries were very afraid of his devil, for fear that they would appear on his contract list.</p><p>“You mentioned about children soldiers… and tens of thousands of them, right?” asked Li Yuquan with a dazed face. “Is my son is going to be sent there?”</p><p>“Well, unless your son can stand out from tens of thousands of children, only then will he enter Sect Master’s eyes again. Else he can only succumb to the breakneck training in the children’s army. That’s for sure since Tang Sect’s custom heavily favors the strong and the weak can only stay at the bottom. Honestly speaking, even if you can become an outer sect disciple, I don’t think you can enter the inner court as early as your son, though.”</p><p>Li Yuquan fell into silence. He realized that he really had a chance of becoming a carp that leaped through the dragon gate. The person who gave him this chance not only saved his life but also rescued his wife and son. It was very likely that he would also be able to make them—father and son—to become terrifying figures.</p><p>He took a deep breath and asked again, “One last question. About that labor camp #1319 in Israel and more than 200 SSS criminals, they…”</p><p>Wolf Head raised his hand to interrupt him and faintly said, “There’s only the two of us now, so I can answer this question. But keep in mind that you must never mention anything about the Tang Sect to outsiders after you’ve become Sect Master’s subordinate. The same goes for everything I just told you. You guessed it right. It’s one of the Boss’ deeds. He went into action himself then, and those people including Spectre have now become outer disciples and each carry out some missions from the sect.”</p><p>Li Yuquan was completely frightened after learning that Tang Xiu’s men were all a group of outlaws, a bunch of monsters and devils that many people feared.</p><p>Wolf Head seemed to notice his thought and added faintly, “If you think that Tang Sect is a den of demons, monsters, and lunatics, then you’re completely mistaken. The sect has a rule that killing good people and bullying the weak are forbidden. We must treat ordinary people amiably but can treat your enemies with ruthlessness. The entire Tang Sect is like a sharp blade in Sect Master’s hand, but it’s like the sword of justice for good people and the death scythe for evil.”</p><p>The explanation instantly relieved Li Yuquan. But another issue immediately popped up in his head. <em>These people are murderers, outlaws who can kill without batting an eye, can they behave themselves as Wolf Head says?</em></p><p>****</p><p>Late at night, at the Xue Family’s residence in Dongshan Province.</p><p>Wearing a coat, Xue Guanzhong looked through the window at the dark night while listening to the strange melody with flickering eyes. When he came to the window, he saw the figure standing in the dark corner of the building and suddenly had a bad feeling.</p><p>It was Xue Zengmei. She was his daughter and the most outstanding member of the younger generation in the Xue Family, whom he had been tasked with an important mission to manage the family’s security company. But she came back secretly and stayed in such a hidden spot now, while also summoning him with the strange syllables that only they knew the meaning of—the means they used to notify each other when something urgent happened.</p><p>“What’s up, Guanzhong?”</p><p>On the bed behind him, Lin Ping sat up in a daze and asked, looking at her husband standing at the window.</p><p>“Go back to sleep. There’s something I need to tend to,” said Xue Guanzhong in a deep voice.</p><p>Having said that, he headed to the door and soon appeared outside the building. He quickly entered the dark shade of the trees as the father and daughter tacitly walked toward a darker spot.</p><p>“What happened?” asked Xue Guanzhong in a very low voice that even Xue Zengmei in front of him was barely able to hear it.</p><p>“Tang Xiu wants to see you, Dad,” said Xue Zengmei.</p><p>“Tang Xiu? Which Tang Xiu?” asked Xue Guanzhong, stunned.</p><p>“Tang Xiu of House Tang from Beijing,” answered Xue Zengmei.</p><p>Xue Guanzhong’s face changed and he furrowed his brows. “He’s the most brilliant junior of that House and also the owner of the Magnificent Tang Corp. What does he want with me?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
