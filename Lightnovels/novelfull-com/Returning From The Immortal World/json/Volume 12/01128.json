He even imagined that it’d have been unlikely that he’d get caught by the mysterious woman had this Finisher appeared.</p><p>“Tang Xiu!”</p><p>With a rapid change in his state of mind, Wang Sheng looked up at Tang Xiu, who floated down from the sky. Wearing a firm and decisive face, he said in a deep tone, “I’ll tell you anything you want to know.”</p><p>Tang Xiu was surprised and scrutinized the man’s face as he asked, “Is it because of the assassin who just wanted to kill you?”</p><p>A chilling light flashed in Wang Sheng’s eyes and he nodded. “That’s right. I’m one of the Darkwind’s top executives and have contributed a lot to the organization all these years. Yet, the Finisher didn’t come to aid me when I was in a desperate situation but wanted to kill me instead. Such an organization doesn’t deserve me keeping its secrets. And my old man… he can just abandon his own son, then…”</p><p>Tang Xiu frowned and asked, “You said your father? Who’s he?”</p><p>“The name is Wang Xian, one of the three founders of the Darkwind—the most influential and powerful figure in the organization,” answered Wang Sheng.</p><p>The revelation gave quite a shock to Tang Xiu as he quickly exchanged glances with the shocked Duanmu Lin. Then, he immediately asked in a deep voice, “You just said your father is the founder of the Darkwind organization, meaning as his son, you must know a lot of secrets of this organization, am I right?”</p><p>“That’s correct.” Wang Sheng nodded and said, “I do know a lot of things about them.”</p><p>Tang Xiu fell into silence for a moment before taking out a Holy Healing pill from the interspatial ring and stuffing it to Wang Sheng’s mouth quickly. “This pill is enough to ensure your life. We won’t kill you, but you must cooperate with us. As far as I’m concerned, the Darkwind poses an enormous threat either to me or to China as a state, so that’s why we need to figure out this organization and find methods to guard against it.”</p><p>Wang Sheng wryly smiled and said, “To live or die doesn’t mean anything to me anymore. It’s not like I can still live a normal life anymore. Your subordinate is very ruthless indeed.”</p><p>“Treating your enemies with softness and kindness is nothing but acting cruelly to yourself,” replied Tang Xiu lightly. “I may not be able to fully restore your strength if you cooperate with me, but I can guarantee that I can heal your injuries. You can still live like a normal person and spend the rest of your life safely.”</p><p>Wang Sheng looked at Tang Xiu for a long while and then said slowly, “I don’t have a problem with fully cooperating with you. But there’s one thing I want to ask you. I’ll tell you everything I know about the Darkwind if you answer it seriously.”</p><p>“Go ahead.” Tang Xiu nodded.</p><p>“You said you’ve grasped the Soul Scouring Art, but why didn’t you cast it on me directly to scour my soul and read my memories, then?” asked Wang Sheng. “You can make sure that I don’t hide anything or lie to you when I tell you everything later.”</p><p>The question made Tang Xiu think for a moment. But then, he shook his head. “There’s a drawback in using the Soul Scouring Art. I may be able to see your memory, but I myself will also be affected. After all, I’m using my spiritual sense to observe your past life and your character. Furthermore, I don’t have much time, and my present strength is still too weak. It’d have been unrealistic if I were to check all of your memories in a short time. It would likely that I’d waste a lot more time than it should if I were to read your every memory for a long time.”</p><p>“You still don’t tell me the whole thing.” Wang Sheng shook his head.</p><p>“You’re very smart. It’s an understatement indeed to not call you wise.” Tang Xiu applauded. “If anything, your memory will turn chaotic once I use the Soul Scouring Art. And you may turn into an idiot even if you survive. Further, the memories obtained by the Soul Scouring Art are hardly a complete one, and some contents would be very disorderly due to the memory collapse caused by the gap in time from the time of death and thus, will lead to the loss of a lot of important information.”</p><p>Wang Sheng quickly grasped the explanation and forced a smile. “I’d rather die than to live like an idiot. Anyhow, I’m done with the question. Just ask your questions directly.”</p><p>“No hurries.” Tang Xiu waved and said, “Things are still not over here. Besides, we got tons of time to talk, to begin with.”</p><p>Having said that, he shifted to Duanmu Lin and said, “Senior Duanmu, everything that happened tonight is very confidential and mustn’t get exposed. You should immediately seal off any channel of news and make sure everything that happened here won’t be known to outsiders for at least a few days.”</p><p>“I understand.” Duanmu Lin nodded. “But I still need the list of all the Darkwind members in China.”</p><p>“The list is stored at the HQ in Fukang Province,” replied Wang Sheng.</p><p>“Then let’s head to the Fukang Province now,” responded Duanmu Lin.</p><p>“I don’t wanna go back there anymore.” Wang Sheng shook his head. “But I’ll call someone to deliver me that list. You can rest your worry about that person. He’s absolutely very loyal to me, so there won’t be any accidents.”</p><p>“Tang Xiu…” Duanmu Lin turned to Tang Xiu, hesitating.</p><p>Tang Xiu scrutinized Wang Sheng’s expression carefully before nodding. “I think we can believe him, Senior Duanmu. I know what it feels like to be betrayed by those close to you. Such betrayal hurts so much.”</p><p>Duanmu Lin also felt that Tang Xiu was right. Therefore, he took his mobile phone and handed it to Wang Sheng. He then stood at the ready next to the man, just in case the man spoke something wrong so he could immediately end the call.</p><p>“No can do.” Wang Sheng shook his head. “Nearly all my bones have been broken by Tang Xiu’s underling. I was still able to resist previously due to the support of my internal energy, but barely. And my Qi has now dispersed due to the serious injuries. Let alone holding a phone, I don’t think I can even lift a piece of paper.”</p><p>Tang Xiu took the phone and said, “Alright, just tell me the number and I’ll help you dial it.”</p><p>Wang Sheng told Tang Xiu the cell number of his trusted adjutant. The number was dialed and the call was quickly picked up, followed by a low and deep voice. “Who is this?”</p><p>“It’s me, Ah Le,” said Wang Sheng. “Go immediately to the vault in the HQ. There’s a box with a combination lock in the innermost corner which stores the list of all the Darkwind members in China. Take it and head straight to Liangang city by yourself. I need it badly now.”</p><p>“Understood!” the other party respectfully replied.</p><p>Wang Sheng nodded to Tang Xiu. After seeing him hang up the phone, he said, “I don’t think you guys need to guard against me. I never would have made that call just now if I had any intention to deceit you.”</p><p>“You’re right.” Tang Xiu nodded. “You could have said something else when you called. Anyway, let’s head inside and find the meeting room to have some good chats about the Darkwind agency. I expect you to tell us everything truthfully.”</p><p>“I have crossed over. I’m a traitor of the Darkwind organization, and they always treat traitors like hell, extremely brutal,” said Wang Sheng bitterly. “I won’t feel anything but happy if you can really exterminate the entire Darkwind organization.”</p><p>“The Darkwind is a very frightening force with terrifying strength. It’s absolutely impossible to destroy it completely given the number of their intel operatives, which are literally in every corner of the world. Your hope is too tall an order. However, I can assure you that China’s Special Abilities Bureau will put you in the protection program for a very long time. At least, your safety can be guaranteed in the next few years.”</p><p>Wang Sheng just nodded wordlessly in response.</p><p>After a while, Tang Xiu and Duanmu Lin took Wang Sheng to a small meeting room, followed by Chen Zhizhong and Zhu Long.</p><p>A long time passed by and everyone stayed in that room. As Tang Xiu and Duanmu Lin left the meeting room together, their expressions looked a bit ugly, especially the former. Tang Xiu heard a lot of things from Wang Sheng, one of which was something he never expected: One of the three leaders of the Darkwind organization turned out to be the patriarch of House Dolan, Angelo Dolan’s grandfather.</p><p>As such, Tang Xiu came to the realization that he must also uproot the Darkwind organization if he wanted to eradicate House Dolan. If these two entities were to join hands and even if the Tang Sect could get rid of these serious troubles, it was close to impossible to not suffer a great loss.</p><p>“We don’t have much time.”</p><p>Tang Xiu looked at the direction of the Golden Coast club’s gate and murmured.</p><p>Duanmu Lin squinted and nodded. “You’re right. It’s about time we leave. Tang Xiu, what do you think about Wang Sheng’s confession? How much of it is reliable and how much is false?”</p><p>“I still have the ability to judge and determine truth from falsehood,” said Tang Xiu. “But at least 80% of his information is true. Looking at it from the other side, it’s also very likely that everything is true as he wants to use our hands to give the Darkwind a lesson.”</p><p>Duanmu Lin didn’t give his opinion and just walked side by side with Tang Xiu to the outside, when Jin Shi came at them half-running from the distance.</p><p>“Someone just came and wants to see Wang Sheng, Sect Master,” reported Jin Shi respectfully. “He said he’s from the Fukang province.”</p><p>Tang Xiu hadn’t yet replied as Duanmu Lin rapidly asked, “Where’s this man?”</p><p>“He’s near the pond in front,” answered Jin Shi.</p><p>Quickly, the few people saw a stalwart man with a vigilant look. It was Tang Xiu who greeted him lightly. “Did you bring ‘it’?”</p><p>“Who are you?” the strong man coldly asked back, “Where’s my Boss?”</p><p>“Your Boss is Wang Sheng, right? He’s injured and is now recovering,” replied Tang Xiu. “Just give me the list you brought and then I’ll send someone to deliver you to Wang Sheng.”</p><p>The big man’s face turned colder as he replied, “I absolutely can’t give you this list with all the Darkwind’s members in China written on it! I must see my Boss. Else, I’ll activate the self-destruct mechanism of this combination-locked suitcase and destroy all the information in it!”</p><p>“Oy, Jin Shi, go fetch Wang Sheng!” Tang Xiu coldly snorted and ordered.</p><p>“Affirmative!” Jin Shi curtly replied and quickly ran towards the conference room.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
