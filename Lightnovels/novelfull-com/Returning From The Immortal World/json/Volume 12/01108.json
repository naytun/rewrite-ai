He couldn’t ignore this old devil’s threat, so he nodded and said, “State your conditions then!”</p><p>“Tang Xiu mustn’t know anything about our deal,” said Demonfreak geezer. “I may be loyal to him for now, but that’s because he can give me what I want. Hence, the deal between us must be kept a secret, and not even a peep of it can be disclosed.”</p><p>In actuality, this issue was also what Will wanted to state out, so he nodded firmly. Medicinal herbs were just minor issues in this deal since he had many people literally everywhere and thus, finding precious herbs was easy. However, the genetic agents were very rare—something he must take under his sole possession so as to train a large number of genetic warriors he could use in the future.</p><p>“I promise!”</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Happy laughter was heard as the two men came to an agreement.</p><p>****</p><p>On Nine Dragons Island.</p><p>Cheng Yannan was sitting atop the palace roof, looking bored while basking in the warm sun and enjoying the gentle breeze. Such a leisure life was something that couldn’t be compared with her situation back when in the South China Sea, which was much more satisfying. It was because this island had too many restrictions. Many stern guards always stopped her whenever she wanted to stroll freely to some places.</p><p>“What exactly is Tang Xiu doing? He hasn’t settled me here, yet he straightly left Nine Dragons Island. Didn’t he agree to train me?”</p><p>She grabbed some salted dried melon seeds from the plate at the side while looking at the sea.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>A figure flickered and instantly appeared near her. Gu Yin grabbed the melon seeds from the plate, threw it into her mouth and smiled. “You’re really enjoying yourself, Big Sis Yannan! But, don’t you have to practice, though?”</p><p>The latter rolled her eyes. “What should I practice? I’ve cultivated the cultivation technique I’ve been taught all these days, but I can’t cultivate any True Essence energy at all!”</p><p>“How could so easy to cultivate True Essence?!” Gu Yin chuckled and said, “But haven’t you sensed the energy in your body from your own special ability? Why don’t you try manipulating that energy and circulate it according to the cultivation route? Master says the universe has innumerable types of energy, it’s fine as long as you can make that energy for your own use.”</p><p>Cheng Yannan’s eyes lit up. She immediately patted her own forehead and cried out, “Alas, why didn’t I think about it before?! Dear Yinyin, you’re really smart. Alright, wait here. I’m going to try to cultivate now. Wait until I succeed and I’ll take you to fly with me into the sky in the future and enjoy the scenery from above.”</p><p>“Ah, I don’t need you to take me to the sky to enjoy the scenery, Big Sis Yannan. I can do it myself,” said Gu Yin.</p><p>“Yinyin dear, just wait and see!” said Cheng Yannan confidently. “Big Sis will be able to fly to the sky sooner than you.”</p><p>“Tee hee…”</p><p>Gu Yin let out crisp laughter. Her slender arm grabbed Cheng Yannan’s waist and they both streaked up to the sky instantly.</p><p>“Aaah…”</p><p>A sharp cry came from Cheng Yannan’s mouth. She was so scared that her body felt cold, disbelief fully painting her face.</p><p><em>‘Fly… I’m… flying?!!’</em></p><p><em>‘A 10-year-old little girl can actually fly?’</em></p><p>“Well, I think you have no hope to fly sooner than me, Big Sis Yannan.” Gu Yin laughed. “But I’ll take you to watch the scenery in the sky now!”</p><p>Cheng Yannan gulped and turned her head to look at Gu Yin’s beaming face with difficulty. After a long time was spent stabilizing her mood, she said, “I was really like a frog at the bottom of a well. I never thought you were already this powerful. But Yinyin dear, don’t tease big sis, got it?”</p><p>She spoke like that, but she was, in fact, so ashamed that she wanted to find a burrow to hide in. It was really unfortunate that they were about 100 meters in mid-air, making it impossible for any hole to exist.</p><p>“No worries, Big Sis Yannan!” Gu Yin laughed. “I’ll never tease nor make fun of you. Besides, you’ve just begun cultivating and you even haven’t yet embarked on the cultivation path. After you’ve cultivated for some time in the future, I’m sure you’ll be able to fly freely in the sky like me. But then again, there’s none other than me who can fly in the sky above Nine Dragons Island, though.”</p><p>“Huh? Why?” Cheng Yannan was confused. “Aren’t there many powerful people here? How can’t they fly in the sky?”</p><p>“It’s an order from Master,” answered Gu Yin.</p><p>Cheng Yannan instantly understood the reason after she remembered some areas she wanted to go but were forbidden to visit. Then, she nodded and said, “It seems once Big Sis has succeeded in cultivating True Essence and has the ability to fly, Big Sis still won’t be able to fly on Nine Dragons Island and take you with me to enjoy the scenery, then.”</p><p>Gu Yin chuckled in response. As she was about to speak, her face suddenly shifted and her eyes lit up as they fixated on a certain direction in the distance. Her face looked happy and she loudly cried out, “Great, Master’s back!”</p><p>Having said that, she towed Cheng Yannan and came to the entrance of the Nine Dragons Island’s array instantly. The duo then saw as a liner quickly entered and docked at the port.</p><p>“Master!”</p><p>Releasing Cheng Yannan, Gu Yin flashed and instantly appeared before Tang Xiu.</p><p>Tang Xiu slightly smiled and touched her ear, asking, “Well, how’s your cultivation recently? Did you happen to breakthrough again?”</p><p>“Nah, Yinyin hasn’t advanced yet, but my cultivation has grown deeper.” Gu Yin shook her head and grinningly said, “But don’t feel disappointed in me, Master. Yinyin will soon break through to the Nascent Soul Stage.”</p><p><em>‘Nascent Soul Stage?’</em></p><p>A terrified look appeared on Cheng Yannan’s face. She had learned about the cultivators’ cultivation levels. But even her dreams, she never ever thought that Gu Yin would soon advance to the Nascent Soul Stage at just 10 years old.</p><p>Behind Tang Xiu.</p><p>Mo Awu, Tang Guang, and the rest exchanged dismayed glances and looked ashamed. They thought they had a great talent for cultivation. They had True Qi foundation back then and, after taking a lot of pills, it was already very amazing to them to have advanced to the Golden Core Stage.</p><p>And yet, every time they heard Gu Yin’s progress, they were always greatly stimulated and agitated. No matter how hard their efforts were, they had always been unable to be on par with Gu Yin’s cultivation speed.</p><p><em>‘Damn, she’s a little monster!’</em></p><p>Everyone in the group secretly sighed inwardly.</p><p>“You know that haste makes waste on the cultivation path, don’t you? You don’t need to rush to advance to the Nascent Soul Stage at once.” Tang Xiu chuckled and said, “Just stay at the Golden Core Stage for a while to sense your cultivation level as well as improving your state of mind. Your future progress will be much faster if your state of mind improves fast enough, .”</p><p>Gu Yin seemed to vaguely understand it and nodded. “Yinyin will remember it, Master. However, I’m already able to fully control my power now. You told me that I can only practice for up to four hours a day, and I only need less to practice every day now.”</p><p>“…”</p><p>The mouths of Mo Awu’s group twitched and they looked up at the sky. They suddenly felt so stupid comparing their cultivation speed with Gu Yin. Her cultivation speed literally made them have no face as her elders on the cultivation path!</p><p>Tang Xiu patted Gu Yin’s shoulder and his eyes then landed on Cheng Yannan. He took her to Nine Dragons Island out of the intention to make her stay and cultivate seriously in this place to then embark on the cultivation path as soon as possible. But the incident where Jin Shi’s team was ambushed and returned seriously injured and the turbulent situation in Saipan made him lead his men to rush to Saipan. Thus, there was no time to settle her down.</p><p>“How’s the place to you, Cheng Yannan?” asked Tang Xiu.</p><p>“It’s great, but… I got nothing to do, so it’s boring.” Cheng Yannan nodded.</p><p>“You won’t get bored again since I’ve come back, though.” Tang Xiu lightly smiled. “Anyway, Awu, escort Cheng Yannan to the training camp later to train with the children and cultivate there. Additionally, allocate some cultivation resources for her and let her start taking some pills once she breaks through to the Qi Refining Stage.”</p><p>“Understood!” Mo Awu replied and turned to look at Cheng Yannan.</p><p>After hearing Tang Xiu’s arrangement, Cheng Yannan immediately felt excited. She had long been looking forward to training. Now that she was finally listed in the arrangement, she couldn’t wait to go there immediately. Furthermore, Gu Yin’s reminder gave her some insights and made her impatient to try it.</p><p>Tang Xiu then shifted his eyes to Tang Guang and the rest. “Kuwako, you’re staying. The rest are dismissed!”</p><p>Shortly after, Tang Guang and the rest left, leaving only Tang Xiu and a respectful Kuwako Yamamoto.</p><p>Tang Xiu paced forward and headed to the palace while lightly speaking, “I told you then I didn’t expect that your progress in cultivation was so fast and advanced to the Golden Core Stage so soon. But you’ve never experienced cultivating in our sect, and just fumbled around by yourself. Therefore, I’m going to teach you some knowledge on the cultivation path in the next few days and help you absorb all the medicinal efficacy accumulated in your system.”</p><p>“I’ll listen to all your arrangements, Sect Master,” replied Kuwako respectfully.</p><p>Tang Xiu lightly smiled and entered the palace with Kuwako. After having a quick meal, he changed his clothes and took her to the beach.</p><p>“Get on board!” called Tang Xiu after jumping on a speedboat and starting it.</p><p>Kuwako didn’t hesitate. After she jumped on the speedboat, Tang Xiu took a quick voyage to the outer array of the island and then stopped the speedboat on the sea after several minutes.</p><p>“What’s this, Sect Master?” asked Kuwako with a puzzled face as she looked at Tang Xiu.</p><p>“Jump into the deep sea and keep sinking all the way down. And remember, you’re to hold on and keep doing it until you’ve reached your limit,” said Tang Xiu lightly.</p><p>Having said that, he produced energy fluctuations around him and quickly jumped off the speedboat and sank down. Kuwako couldn’t make heads or tails of what training Tang Xiu had in store for her, but she still gritted her teeth and followed suit. At the same time, she released her own True Essence and made a half-inch barrier to make sure she wouldn’t be drenched wet by the water.</p><p>50 meters.</p><p>100 meters.</p><p>200 meters.</p><p>As the 200 meters depth beneath the sea surface was reached, Tang Xiu stopped and waited calmly. Soon after, Kuwako then appeared in front of him.</p><p>“Can you still keep up?” said Tang Xiu, transmitting his voice.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
