Gong Wan’er has already briefed you about the Joyous Palace’s situation here. I wonder if you have any good ideas?” Tang Xiu took a sip of hot tea and then asked.</p><p>“May I know how many experts you’ve brought from Tang Sect to Japan?” asked Blackface Buddha in a deep voice.</p><p>“Coming here secretly was not easy, so our number here is very few, less than 10 people to be exact.” Tang Xiu shook his head and replied, “However, my subordinate has been operating in Japan for a long time and we have quite a number of available manpower at the ready. Though most of them are not experts—the strongest among them are at the Foundation Establishment Stage. But we have quite a number of them here, so they can also take part in the battle.”</p><p>Blackface Buddha shook his head and replied, “The number is still too few, way too few. It seems this monk must inform the sect to ask the Grand Abbot to dispatch another group of people. What about you, Sect Master Tang? Will your Tang Sect also dispatch a number of exports to come here?”</p><p>Tang Xiu somehow felt disappointed, but when he saw Jade Buddha wearing a faint smile, his expression was slightly shifted and asked that monk, “What do you think, Jade Buddha?”</p><p>Jade Buddha glanced at Blackface Buddha and calmly said, “Sometimes using too much force is not necessary for killing as we can use our brain to work around it. The remnant of Joyous Sect, the one who calls himself Joyous Palace Master, has managed to operate in Japan for so many years. I believe he doesn’t want to give up his foundation here, while the Japanese authority sees them as a thorn in their eyes. If anything, we can make use of the official force of this country to kill them first. They would then end up exchanging heavy blows against each other and we can reap the benefits as the third party.”</p><p>Raising his thumbs up to him, Tang Xiu praised. “Jade Buddha’s idea happens to coincide with mine. Also, that mysterious official of Japan, General Fukuda, not only has trained lots of practitioners, but he has also been using living people for some cruel experiments to secretly form an army of genetic warriors. I assume that all the Masters here are not aware of this term, so I’ll explain it to you. Genetic warriors are those who have been injected with some beasts’ genes and thus, inherit some of these beasts’ traits and characteristics. Drawing an analogy to make it clearer, let’s assume that someone was injected by cheetah genes. His speed and strength will increase tremendously, yet they will also turn berserk and cruel as a cheetah when fighting. Another instance is an injection with monkey genes. They will be very energetic, vigorous, fast and also have sharp claws and teeth. All in all, they are like mutants.”</p><p>The smile on Jade Buddha’s face froze and intense killing intent overflowed in his eyes after listening to Tang Xiu’s explanation. Then, he said in a deep voice, “Listening to your description, then they’re no longer human, Sect Master Tang.”</p><p>“They are no longer genuine human, indeed.” Tang Xiu nodded. “The extremely savage beastly nature overcame them, yet their strengths are also remarkable. Most importantly, I once helped those from the state department to wipe out certain biochemistry and genetic research lab belonging to a certain force in China, from which I learned that such genetic research requires lots of living humans to experiment on. Allegedly, only about 10% survived in the early phase of the experiment.”</p><p>“I know a certain state agency in Japan that runs such genetic labs.” Kuwako interjected all of a sudden. “House Yamamoto has many people in politics and some work for the government. It happens that some of them are in charge of the security work of these secret research labs. The report he told me said that several hundreds of people have died in the research at these labs.”</p><p>“Damn!”</p><p>“They deserve to be thrown into the Avici Hell!”</p><p>Both Jade Buddha and Blackface Buddha angrily blurted out.</p><p>For Tang Xiu himself, it was rather unexpected to him that Kuwako would speak out. It was his original intention to drive the fury of these Buddhist Sect monks toward this Japanese agency, but Kuwako’s interjection had a much better effect than what he had planned out. Without being noticed, he threw her a praising look and then solemnly said, “Two Masters, I’m sure you are also aware that these Japanese have once committed sins and crimes in China in the past. Maybe you also experienced and witnessed that catastrophe then. I do admit that Japan still has many good people, but right now, some ruthless and inhuman people are holding the power here. The Japanese people will end up having a difficult time if we just let them off. Even likely… we can see the emergence of a massive army of genetic warriors in Japan. There’s no guarantee they won’t strike other countries and persecute its people with such a powerful force.”</p><p>“While we’re cleaning up our school, we might as well deal a heavy blow to this General Fukuda,” said Blackface Buddha in a heavy tone. “At least, we must destroy their labs and those harmful genetic agents.”</p><p>Jade Buddha squinted his glittering eyes as he looked at Tang Xiu and asked, “What’s your take on this one, Sect Master Tang?”</p><p>“My idea is similar to Blackface Buddha’s,” said Tang Xiu. “Destroy the Joyous Palace completely and ruin the army of genetic warriors and General Fukuda’s underlings. We can easily move and accomplish our purpose here as long as we have both of them locked up.”</p><p>“The question now is, how can we accomplish it?” asked Jade Buddha.</p><p>“The Joyous Palace and the Japanese authority have just been engaged in a large skirmish a while ago,” said Tang Xiu. “The latter ended up the victor and the former suffered a huge loss. I’m sure both sides can’t wait to decimate each other now, so we just need to instigate and incite them to make it explode.”</p><p>“You seem to have devised a plan, Sect Master Tang,” said Jade Buddha, “The Buddhist Sect may not bother to machinate such schemes and intrigues, though I myself think that schemes are also part of our wisdom. I guarantee we’ll listen to your command in fighting them as long as your plan can get my approval.”</p><p>“My plan is to assassinate some members of the Joyous Palace and some of General Fukuda’s underlings,” said Tang Xiu. “We’ll show ourselves as people from Japanese authority when killing the Joyous Palace members. Japan is now full of surging undercurrents and what we must do is to make it more chaotic, inciting their anger, and based on that, keep adding fuel to the flames, driving them to tear all decorum and go into a full-blown war that devours each other.”</p><p>“If so, then we need accurate intel, Sect Master Tang,” commented Jade Buddha.</p><p>“The information about the Joyous Palace shouldn’t be difficult to gather. Isn’t that right, Gong Wan’er?” said Tang Xiu.</p><p>Gong Wan’er was silent for a few seconds before nodding without a word. Then, she said, “Give me some time, I’ll deal with the intel on Joyous Palace.”</p><p>“Well, since Gong Wan’er is willing to cooperate, we can expect to have the intel on Joyous Palace smoothly,” said Tang Xiu smilingly. “As for the underlings of General Fukuda, it’s also easy to find them out. They are Japanese officials, to begin with. Further, they have just delivered heavy blows to the Joyous Palace. It’s a turbulent time, so, as long as we are alert and pay more attention, it won’t be difficult to find a few leads to them. However, there’s one person that needs to be neutralized in advance.”</p><p>“Who is it?”</p><p>Everyone in the hall looked curious.</p><p>“Ki Kitagawa. He’s a Joyous Palace’s renegade, while his true identity is someone from <em>that</em> Japanese state department,” said Tang Xiu.</p><p>Afterward, everyone was engaged in the discussion and analysis for a long time and a rough operation plan was finally devised. The Joyous Palace was now in a bad state, so it was likely they wouldn’t have time to pay attention to Kuwako’s issue. Therefore, whether it was House Yamamoto or the manpower under Kuwako’s control, all of them were ordered to spread out to various cities in Japan to conduct a secret investigation on the Joyous Palace and that particular armed forces of Japan state agency.</p><p>A piece of information was like a snowflake that kept piling and interweaving in front of Tang Xiu and the rest. The rough planning framework was constantly being filled and becoming more detailed and complex.</p><p>****</p><p>Two days later.</p><p>Deafening music filled a certain nightclub’s hall in the capital as unceasing flashing multicolored lights decorated the scene. The dance floor was full of many men and women dancing crazily. Many addicts could be seen scattered in each corner, sipping or smoking their “delicious stuff” while young waiters brought a plate of wine and fruit each and constantly shuttled back and forth in the rest area, but their vigilant eyes kept scanning the crowds around.</p><p>Tang Xiu and Kuwako, who had changed their appearances, looked for an empty table and finally found it. They leisurely took a seat and he called the waiter to order several beers and then asked Kuwako with a smile, “Have you noticed those eyes around you, Kuwako? Well, it seems that you can’t stop the prying eyes of those wolves around you even though you’re hiding most of your beauty. How about having a bet with me? Will someone come over and hit a conversation with you?”</p><p>A smile sketched on the corner of Kuwako’s mouth. She never dared think that Sect Master would tease her one day and even praise her beauty. She did have such a thought that she was a peerless beauty and a rare belle in the world, but that pride of hers slowly faded away ever since she knew Tang Xiu and learned about the women around him.</p><p>However, right at this moment, she saw Gong Wan’er. Despite the veil covering the latter’s face, she could see her face clearly and was a little perturbed by her suffocating beauty.</p><p>“Well, how about having a date once our work here is done since you think that I’m not bad, Boss?” Kuwako stared at Tang Xiu with a faint smile.</p><p>“Ugh…”</p><p>Tang Xiu’s expression stiffened and he immediately forced out an awkward smile. “Well, the weather is really great tonight, it’s just dark and windy—the best time for killing. I hope we got the right news about that big fish coming here tonight.”</p><p>Kuwako chuckled at his response and was about to speak when someone approached her. The man decorated himself with a very expensive suit, neatly combed hair straight to the back, and slightly raised his sleeve to reveal a famous watch on his wrist.</p><p>“Care to dance with me, pretty?”</p><p>The middle-aged man was smiling, but his eyes lingered on Kuwako’s bosom.</p><p>Kuwako rolled her eyes at him and waved her hands as though she was driving a fly away. “Just go back to where you come from and don’t bother me. God! How come there are so many blind people these days? Can’t they see I got a male partner next to me?”</p><p>“YOU…”</p><p>The middle-aged man himself had an uncommon and extraordinary manner, but Kuwako’s remark made him furious and he loudly cursed. “B****h, do you know who I am?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
