He took out two cigs and handed them to the man and his father before lighting them up. After lit one for himself, he took two deep puffs slowly and then smilingly spoke, “How can I lie to you, Uncle? Your current strength should exceed what you have previously. You can give it a try if you don’t believe me.”</p><p>Ni Penggang hesitated for a moment before he immediately looked at the two middle-aged men standing nearby. After waving at them, he said, “You two are powerful experts. I can defeat you one on one, but I’d have a hard time facing you both at the same time. I wanna have a spar with you both.”</p><p>The two middle-aged men exchanged glances and one of them wore a strange smile. “Are you sure, Boss?”</p><p>Ni Penggang paced a step forward in response, hooking a finger at him and saying, “Come at me and unleash everything you got.”</p><p>“Roger that!”</p><p>The two men exchanged glances and immediately charged toward Ni Penggang. Their speed was very fast and their strength was strong as well. Each of their movements created whistling sounds, and their striking punch had already reached Ni Penggang.</p><p>Brows slightly furrowed, Ni Penggang engaged in footwork and instantly evaded the two men’s strikes and shouted sternly, “Did you guys not eat yet or something? I told you to give me everything you got!”</p><p>The two middle-aged men looked confused. They had clearly gone all out, for God’s sake! Their joint attack just now carried their rich combat experience and was flawless, and yet, why did Ni Penggang avoid them so easily?</p><p>“His speed,” whispered a middle-aged man.</p><p>The other one squinted and replied, “Even if he is stronger than before, we’re not weak ourselves. Let’s continue.”</p><p>“Got it!”</p><p>Both of them were hardened experts and had rich actual combat experience. They constantly forced Ni Penggang to retreat with their joint attack. No matter what they did, however, they were still unable to injure him and weren’t able to take any advantage. Even Ni Penggang’s counterattacking punches and kicks hit them instead.</p><p>“STOP!”</p><p>Ni Penggang ceased attacking and stood still in his spot. He furrowed his brows and shouted, “What the hell are you two doing, huh? I told you to give me all you got, didn’t I? Your strikes today are too soft, and your speed is so slow! I could have swept your teeth clean if I wanted to in just half a minute.”</p><p>“What?!!”</p><p>The two men’s eyes stared wide and just dumbly stared at Ni Penggang’s angry face. Suddenly, they seemed to realize something and turned to look at Tang Xiu with a burning hope.</p><p>It took only half a day, but Tang Xiu was able to make their Boss, Ni Penggang, more formidable. It was a method that went against the natural order. They both also wanted to become stronger and advance a level in a short time like that.</p><p>Tang Xiu felt a bit amused inwardly after seeing their looks. He came to Ni Penggang’s side and half-smilingly said, “Well, it wasn’t that they didn’t go all out, Uncle Ni. It’s because you’ve become stronger. You may not realize it yet, but you’ll only understand how formidable a cultivator is after you’ve really advanced to the Qi Refining Stage. You’ll see that you’re ten times stronger than the current you by then.”</p><p>Ni Penggang stared blankly at Tang Xiu for a moment. Then, he shifted his focus to his two men and asked in a deep voice, “Are you sure you have gone all out just now?”</p><p>“We are 100% sure. We even squeezed out every bit of our power.”</p><p>The two men were secretly disappointed to find that Tang Xiu just straightly ignored them. They immediately answered seriously upon hearing Ni Penggang’s inquiry.</p><p>Ni Penggang turned silent. Only after a long time did he finally look up and touch his chin, saying, “I’m going to follow and work under you later, Tang Xiu.”</p><p>“Ehh? Please don’t say that, Uncle Ni!” Tang Xiu hurriedly interjected. “Dad is watching us, and you’ll only make him give me some lessons!”</p><p>A smile appeared on Tang Yunde’s face. He was very satisfied with his son’s performance today. He and Ni Penggang were life-and-death brothers and had common enemies. Yet, he didn’t have 100% assurance that the latter didn’t felt any dissent and disloyalty after so many years. But regardless of that, he had literally submitted to his son.</p><p>“Anyway, hand over the security company and its manpower to Xiu’er, Penggang! I’m sure he can train a large number of elite soldiers under his leadership, so we can avenge our enmity by then,” said Tang Yunde smilingly.</p><p>“The senior members of our security company were all formed by you, Brother Tang. I’ve only been replenishing the new blood, so the number of manpower of the company has now reached 80 people,” said Ni Penggang without hesitation. “You can be assured that all of them are loyal and reliable brothers, so I’m very relieved to give them to Tang Xiu since this boy has the abilities.”</p><p>In the warehouse, the entire 80 members of Cloud Cauldron Security Company were all performing physical training. Beads of sweat had them drenched wet and they looked tired at this moment, yet none of them stopped training.</p><p>BAM…</p><p>A man who was as strong as an ox was kicking the hanging sandbags swiftly and fiercely. His naked upper body looked glossy, and awful scars decorated his streamlined muscles, which showed that he had faced and frequented life-and-death battles countless times. A scar also painted his face from the right eyebrow to the left, looking like a lying scorpion, making him look fearsome.</p><p>“Change your sandbag to the one that is more resistant to kicking, Yang Hu!”</p><p>A stalwart man grabbed a towel and wiped the sweat from his face and neck. He squeezed the towel to force the sweat out, shook his head and shouted.</p><p>“We got no sandbag more resistant to kicking, Captain. You kicked and blasted two of them this month. That was our last stock,” a similarly tall young man in a black exercise suit rolled his eyes and answered with a helpless face.</p><p>The burly man’s brows turned 川 and he angrily retorted. “Are all the manufacturers that produce these shitty sandbags trash or something? Or are those bastards in the arsenal embezzling the funds and materials? These damn sandbags are not even enough for me to use even for 3 to 5 days—so fucking rubbish!”</p><p>The young man flung his face to the side directly. He was crystal clear about his captain’s strength and power. Even if his punching power didn’t reach 250kg, it shouldn’t be far off either. His kicking power was even more exaggerated at around 600kg each foot. Coupled with his 1.9-meter height, he was absolutely a humanoid monster.</p><p>Clap, clap, clap…</p><p>Following his father and Ni Penggang into the warehouse, Tang Xiu’s vision swept over the burly man and he applauded smilingly. “What good strength. It’s very rare for the average person to have such a big strength. But well, the quality of sandbags produced by the factories is indeed appalling. But if you need some sandbags, I’ll have my men send you some that are impossible to explode even if you have thousands of pounds of punching power.”</p><p>“Boss!”</p><p>The burly man nodded to Ni Penggang and just glanced at Tang Xiu apathetically. When his gaze shifted to Tang Yunde, his pupils shrunk and disbelief overflowed from his eyes. The towel in his hand fell to the floor and his body trembled. He charged forward like crazy toward Tang Yunde and loudly exclaimed, “You… are… Captain?!!”</p><p>Tang Yunde’s eyes were a bit moist. He didn’t allow Ni Penggang to tell the news that he was still alive to the rest of their brothers. He had been planning to hand them over to his son one day, so they could work for him.</p><p>“Zaibiao.” Tang Yunde’s lips squirmed as he looked at the burly Li Zaibiao’s disbelieving face and slowly raised his arms.</p><p>Clap…</p><p>The two men’s palm tightly gripped one another. They hugged tightly and patted each other’s back. They were unable to calm their stirred-up emotions for a long time.</p><p>“Captain!”</p><p>“Instructor!!”</p><p>“Brother Tang!!!”</p><p>Moving fast like a whirlwind, a dozen drenched wet middle-aged men quickly dashed to Tang Yunde’s front. All of them wore shocked and pleasantly surprised expressions.</p><p>Tang Yunde released Li Zaibiao and embraced each and every one of the burly middle-aged men.</p><p>Words were not necessary among men, for they only needed to know that you were safe and sound to show their sincerest attitude.</p><p>But the rest of these stalwart men, more than 60 of them, were looking confused, though they felt that Tang Yunde was vaguely familiar.</p><p>“Who’s this guy?” asked a big man who was holding a dumbbell with blue veins protruding on his forehead.</p><p>“No idea, mate!”</p><p>“But he looks familiar, though?”</p><p>“Well, could he be one of us? Besides, Cap’ seems to forget himself meeting him.”</p><p>“Did you hear what Cap’ just addressed him? Captain?”</p><p>As the last person’s voice faded away, the tens of strong men around him were all stunned and surprised. Disbelief covered their faces after half a minute and they shot fervent and fanatical looks toward Tang Yunde.</p><p>“That’s right… it’s Captain Tang Yunde!”</p><p>“It’s him!”</p><p>“Damn right you’re. It’s definitely him!”</p><p>“That’s our idol, guys!”</p><p>“…”</p><p>They were all iron-blooded warriors—soldiers who had retired from the army and had experienced countless life-and-death battles. But they were unified by one role model in their hearts, which was the heroic captain of the special forces more than two decades ago, Tang Yunde.</p><p>He was like a legend in the army, a powerful God of War.</p><p>Tang Yunde’s gaze swept over the old brothers lined up before him. His lips squirmed a few times as he hoarsely spoke with a happy face, “Great! This is great! You’re all still alive. I never thought that I could see you again after waking up, brothers.”</p><p>Li Zaibiao asked, “Where have you been all these years, Captain? And what do you mean by waking up?”</p><p>It was Ni Penggang who explained it to him. “Brothers, Brother Tang was secretly schemed against and attacked by powerful enemies and then turned into vegetative all these years. He has spent two decades in bed, but now he woke up and returned back to us while harboring the same hatred as us!”</p><p><em>‘He went vegetative for 20 years?!!’</em></p><p>Everyone looked shocked. They never dreamed that Tang Yunde could actually wake up from that condition. Further, he looked like he was no different from normal people.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
