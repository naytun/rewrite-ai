Following the announcement of the important news by Wang Sheng, the position transfer for supervisors had also been announced for the next 3 years, so they needed to go back and prepare for the handover.</p><p>Time passed by, and plates of dishes and wines were constantly consumed to their hearts’ content. After feeling full, some began conversing and others were ready to leave together, though some also prepared to stay for the night and leave early in the morning.</p><p>In the vicinity near the Golden Coast club, ten black cars silently parked in a remote spot. No lights, people, nor sound could be seen or heard. Duanmu Lin’s eyes were glittering in the dark, looking at the tranquil and calm-looking Tang Xiu at his side. He couldn’t help but ask, “I think we came too early, Tang Xiu. The best time to get them should be at 2 or 3 AM!”</p><p>“Haih, would you please calm yourself, Senior Duanmu?” Tang Xiu slightly shook his head and replied smilingly, “I told you I already have it arranged, didn’t I? It’s 8:05 PM now, and I guarantee you we’ll start the motion in half an hour at most.”</p><p>Duanmu Lin could only shake his head with a bitter smile. “You keep holding everything until the story reaches the climax, Brat! You’re really making me feel like hundreds of claws scratching my heart, you know that? That leaves me in a foul mood!”</p><p>“Well, at least I can make sure you can slay those people happily like chopping a melon later, Senior Duanmu,” said Tang Xiu smilingly.</p><p>Duanmu Lin couldn’t help but chuckle after hearing his remark. “Just when the hell is you seeing those Darkwind people like some soft shrimp, Kid?! You dare say chopping them will be just like chopping melon? Wait until the critical time and any of them slips through the net, kiddo. If we can catch all these top executives of Darkwind in one fell swoop this time, the remaining ones will definitely hide much deeper and it will be very difficult to find their traces, much less eliminating them again in the future.”</p><p>“No worries.”</p><p>Tang Xiu let out a faint smile and was about to continue speaking as a text message prompt sound was heard from his phone. He quickly opened the text message and immediately handed the phone to Duanmu Lin, saying, “This is the photo taken from the interior, Senior Duanmu. The one in the photo is called Wang Sheng, the General Director of Darkwind branch in China. He holds the list of the Darkwind’s intel operatives in entire China.”</p><p>Eyes contracted, Duanmu Lin replied in a deep voice, “We must apprehend this Wang Seng and get that list from him no matter how big the price is!”</p><p>“Yeah.” Tang Xiu nodded. “The Darkwind’s intel network in China will indeed be paralyzed if we kill their top executives in that club. But the rest of their intel operatives will definitely choose to become sleeper cells. Then it will be very difficult for us to dig them out again in the future.”</p><p>“True that.” Duanmu Lin replied with a solemn look, “We must get that list no matter what it takes. I don’t give a damn about other countries, but we must purify the mainland from this Darkwind cancer thoroughly!”</p><p>While the man was speaking, the ringtone of Tang Xiu’s mobile phone rang again. It was still a text message, but the content was short: It’s time!</p><p>“It’s time!”</p><p>Tang Xiu patted the seat in front and said in a deep tone, “Head straight to the Golden Coast club. Straightly neutralize any resistance you encounter!”</p><p><em>Vroom, vroom…</em></p><p>The roaring engines of ten black cars were like wild horses’ neighs as they vroomed and moved fast toward the Golden Coast club. As the club’s majestic gate appeared in sight, eight stalwart men who were on guard at the gate instantly scrambled into defensive positions as though they were about to face formidable enemies.</p><p>“We’re from the Special Abilities Bureau. Make way or die!”</p><p>A chilling shout was heard from the black car at the front. The sound of sudden braking and car drifting were then heard as four ability users from the agency bolted out from the car. Right at the instant the eight stalwart men’s face drastically changed, sparks of lightning suddenly struck and blades of wind swept over even before they were able to remove the safety lock of their guns, causing those eight burly men to meet their deaths in just a few breaths.</p><p>“BREAK!!!”</p><p>An Earth bender waved his arms and an earth dragon formed by a pile of mud struck into the gate and crashed down to the ground, to clear the path from the black cars to drive fast to the interior.</p><p>“ENEMIES!!!”</p><p>Furious roars from tens of security guards came from the distance, followed by a rain of bullets. The glass windows shattered and bullets drilled holes in the cars’ body. Yet, the cars kept speeding up to the front. Shadows then flickered, bolting out from the car and moving like the Gods of Death that summoned forth various supernatural abilities to carry out a frenzied slaughter toward the security guards.</p><p>Inside the black car in the middle, Duanmu Lin’s eyes kept flickering. He was using his special ability to block the bullets shot at their car. He turned to look at Tang Xiu and said, “It’s about time you show your card, isn’t it? There are no experts in the surroundings, but we got too many people to deal with in the interior and likely, we’ll have many experts there. It’s just impossible for our men to accomplish the expected outcome with none of them slipping out!”</p><p>“Haste makes waste, Senior Duanmu. Please be patient,” replied Tang Xiu with a smile yet again.</p><p>Duanmu Lin was eager to retort but hesitated. He just realized that he wasn’t like a mature and steady old man whenever he was with Tang Xiu. It was this young man who looked wiser and more prudent than he was, the old geezer who was supposed to have experienced the vicissitudes of life and the world.</p><p>At this moment, Tang Xiu instantly released his perception and covered the range of several hundreds of meters. He felt satisfied with his previous plan since there were at least hundreds of people who had been rendered incapable and were weakling sitting on the floor, some of whom were struggling to stand up but failed due to the effect of the drug.</p><p>“Not bad.”</p><p>A smile sported on his face. But as he shifted his eyes to Duanmu Lin and found the old man wanting to speak but hesitating, he patted the front seat and smilingly spoke, “Park at the front! Well, you should remember what I told you before, Senior Duanmu. I promised you that you can easily chop or slay those people, didn’t I? I guarantee you can do so with those enemies inside with ease.”</p><p><em>Screech…</em></p><p>As the cars stopped, more than 30 people, members of the Special Abilities Bureau and Tang Sect disciples, quickly neutralized the resistance in the surrounding and quickly gathered in front of Tang Xiu and Duanmu Lin.</p><p>“Tang Xiu, this operation is yours to command,” said Duanmu Lin solemnly.</p><p>Tang Xiu didn’t refuse and said, “I’ll obey the order. Everyone, heed my order! Secure the interior and make those people lose their ability to act and have them under control, and kill those who resist without mercy!”</p><p>“Yes, Sir!”</p><p>Figures charged inside one after another, leaving only Jin Shi and Chen Zhizhong behind.</p><p>“Interesting! Collaborating with ability users from the Special Abilities Bureau, trying to eradicate my Darkwind organization in China… or not… aren’t you too arrogant and conceited?”</p><p>Just as the voice faded away, more than a dozen cultivators emitting out an enormous pressuring aura rushed out of the clubhouse lightning-fast and arrived in front of Tang Xiu and Duanmu Lin’s group of four.</p><p>Tang Xiu stroked his chin and smilingly said, “If my guess is correct, you should be that Elder Wei, yes? Weren’t you the one who cast that restriction seal on my useless nothing disciple?”</p><p>Old Wei, their leader, sneered. “I heard that Boss Tang is young and promising, though it never occurred to me that you’re also a powerful cultivator yourself. To think that you can break the seal on Chen Zhizhong’s body… no wonder you can be his Master, huh. Yet, I never thought you’re also a member of China’s Special Abilities Bureau.”</p><p>“Well, well. I think I still have tons of things you have yet to find out, Old Wei.” Tang Xiu smiled and said, “I’m gonna show them to you later, though.”</p><p>A look of fear flashed in Duanmu Lin’s eyes and he snorted coldly. “It turns out to be you, Wei Xianyong. It’s been two decades since I last saw you. I didn’t expect that you’ve become the Darkwind’s dog.”</p><p>“Heh, I gave you a lesson about your special abilities more than two decades ago, didn’t I, Duanmu Lin?” sneered Wei Xianyong. “If anything, you were no threat then, and definitely pose no threat now. Call your rats back to where you come from if you know your limitations, else don’t blame for being ruthless, for I’m gonna butcher you first before I raze your Special Abilities Bureau again.”</p><p>Duanmu Lin sneered and scowled again and again. He may have yielded and retreated if Tang Xiu wasn’t here today as he didn’t want to be Wei Xianyong’s enemy. But today’s situation was different since Tang Xiu was a powerful expert who was at least on par with a Nascent Soul Stage powerhouse. No matter how powerful Wei Xianyong was, it was unlikely for Tang Xiu to even need to use his palm to slap him dead.</p><p>“They are yours, Tang Xiu,” said Duanmu Lin in a deep tone.</p><p>“Rest assured, Senior Duanmu.” Tang Xiu smilingly said, “This jumping clown isn’t worth it entering my eyes, to begin with.”</p><p>Duanmu Lin shot a cold glance at Wei Xianyong and strode to the distance. What he wanted to apprehend the most was the General Director of Darkwind Branch in China… Wang Sheng.</p><p>Tang Xiu just let out a faint smile, hooking his fingers to Wei Xianyong and his men, saying, “You see, I also think you got a quite surprising power for being able to cast a restriction seal on my disciple, Elder Wei. But no matter how powerful the enemy is, I’m his Master, so I can’t just sit by and watch as my disciple is schemed against and ignore it, can I? Come, you got your lackeys to graze here, so let me taste how strong your teaching is.”</p><p>In response, Wei Xianyong shot Tang Xiu a contemptuous look since he couldn’t sense any aura of an expert from Tang Xiu whatsoever. It was Jin Shi who was next to Tang Xiu whose aura somewhat gave him a chill, instead.</p><p>“Deal with those two puppies around Tang Xiu. I wanna have a look at whether this brat actually has the capital to be so arrogant!” Wei Xianyong waved, and several experts instantly charged forward toward Jin Shi and Chen Zhizhong.</p><p>“Bring it on!”</p><p>Jin Shi hideously grinned, and two daggers instantly appeared in his hands, whereas a long spear suddenly appeared out of thin air in Chen Zhizhong’s hand. With a shake of his arm, the image of the spear then emerged.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
