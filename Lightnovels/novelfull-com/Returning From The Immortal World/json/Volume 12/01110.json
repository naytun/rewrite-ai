He never thought Cheng Yannan still had such a narrow vision after she became an ability user. The children on the training ground were indeed really young, but they, nevertheless, possessed powerful strength; any of them could easily kill a martial arts grandmaster should they go outside.</p><p>“Follow me!”</p><p>Leaving this order, he took Cheng Yannan, Gu Yin, Kuwako Yamamoto, Mo Awu, and the rest to the training ground quickly.</p><p>The discontent in Cheng Yannan’s heart was not small, and her eyes constantly stared daggers at Tang Xiu’s back. She was somewhat disappointed with him because she felt she wasn’t taken seriously at all. He attended the training of that Japanese woman, Kuwako Yamamoto, by himself, while she used to be his old classmate. And yet, she was thrown into a group of children soldiers. Did that mean she must play babysitter for those children?</p><p>Quickly after, Tang Xiu came to the training ground with the group. They saw some children carrying heavy sandbags while running—part of their weight training to exercise their physical strength, whereas some other children were sitting cross-legged on a stone slab and silently practicing.</p><p>“Get set!”</p><p>Tang Xiu stepped on the air and walked step by step for a dozen meters high. He shouted loudly to the nearly 1,000 children on the training ground.</p><p><em>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</em></p><p>Figures flashed and moved quickly. In just ten seconds, nearly 1,000 children were arranged in an orderly formation.</p><p>Cheng Yannan still held a contemptuous look as she followed Tang Xiu. She thought that Tang Xiu brought her here to make her lose face.</p><p>However, when she saw how fast they moved, her heartbeat rapidly sped up and she couldn’t help but exclaim, “How is that possible?”</p><p>Tang Xiu just shot her an indifferent glance. After the nearly 1,000 children gave the salute, he spoke in a deep voice. “You looked down on them, Cheng Yannan, so I’ll let them give you a good lesson today.”</p><p>After saying that, he shifted his vision to the children and said aloud, “All of you are the future talents of the sect, who will become a corps of powerhouses that follow me which I can summon at will. Though you are very young, you already know the cruelty of the world. You’ve witnessed that the weak can only be trampled on and can only live a miserable life. I’ve decided to assess you today. I hope I can see the results of your hard work in cultivation.”</p><p>“Yes, Sir!”</p><p>A thousand children answered in unison.</p><p>Nodding with satisfaction, Tang Xiu pointed to Cheng Yannan. “She’s our sect’s new member because she and I have been good friends. That’s why she feels rather conceited. She looks down on you after she previously came here and found out that she must train with you. She thought you are all just a group of babies who haven’t grown up yet. Do you want her to look down on you?”</p><p>“NO! We refuse!”</p><p>The eyes of nearly 1,000 children glared at Cheng Yannan at the same time. They seemingly couldn’t wait to teach her a lesson.</p><p>“I’ll give you this chance, Cheng Yannan.” Tang Xiu provoked. “You see, these 960 children soldiers like babies. But you can pick any one of them to have a spar. If you have energy and want to take on all of them one after another, I’ll give my consent as well. You have my word that if you defeat even only one out of them, I’ll apologize for my previous attitude and will arrange someone else to carry on special training for you. You can even expect me to invest a lot of cultivation resources so your progress of cultivation will advance rapidly and make you a formidable expert.”</p><p>After seeing the speed of these children just now, Cheng Yannan felt her heart was faintly drumming. But the anger that was just dissipated filled her heart again after hearing Tang Xiu’s words. “Are you out of your mind? You want me to bully these children? You know I already awakened my special abilities, don’t you? Even eight to ten average big men are not my match!”</p><p>“Eight to ten big men, huh?” Tang Xiu sneered. “That’s amazing! If so, you can pick any one of them. I wanna see how such a formidable ability user like yourself defeats these children.”</p><p>“YOU—”</p><p>Cheng Yannan held her breath and turned to look at the thousand children, saying aloud, “Some of you, stand up. I want to see what kind of minor abilities you’ve learned after undergoing Tang Xiu’s training!”</p><p><em>Whoosh!</em></p><p>A thin figure quickly appeared in front of her. The boy’s speed was so fast that Cheng Yannan was unable to react and only felt that he already appeared in front of her.</p><p>“My name is Tang Jin, please enlighten me.”</p><p>The seven-plus-years-old Tang Jin acted like a small adult and spoke with courtesy by cupping his fists.</p><p>Cheng Yannan felt funny, angry, and amused at the same time. Although she was angry with Tang Xiu for making fun of her, she was really reluctant to fight with the child before her. She hesitated for a moment, shook her head, and said, “You’re Tang Jin, right? Please don’t make a fool of yourself. You’re still a child and I just spoke like that since I’m angry. No worries, I won’t hit you.”</p><p>“Please enlighten me,” said Tang Jin with a serious face.</p><p>“Eh…” Cheng Yannan didn’t expect this child would be this stubborn. She already spoke like that, yet the boy kept challenging her. Should she fight him? It’d still a disgrace even if she did win because he was only a 7-years-old boy. But if she lost… that was impossible. How could she lose to a child?</p><p>However, she saw how serious Tang Jin’s face was, so she shook her head and reluctantly said, “You want to get a beating, so I’ll teach you a lesson, brat! I’ll make you realize that you’re a child who doesn’t know the immensity of the world.”</p><p>Having said that, she moved with footwork faster than the average person’s running speed. She appeared instantly in front of Tang Jin and delivered a punch to him. Though she only exerted a little of her strength, she was confident that her punch would surely hit the boy’s shoulder and make him cry.</p><p><em>Whoosh!</em></p><p>An afterimage flashed and Cheng Yannan’s punch that was supposed to be a sure hit was off the mark.</p><p>“How can this be?!!”</p><p>Cheng Yannan’s face froze. When she was about to turn her head to find Tang Jin’s trace, she felt a huge force hit her back, sending her flying backward for seven-plus meters, and then heavily fell on the ground. She rolled over a few meters before finally stopping.</p><p><em>Cough, cough…</em></p><p>Feeling a burning pain on her back, Cheng Yannan felt the blood in her body turning chaotic. She quickly bounced up and shot a disbelieving look at Tang Jin.</p><p>The boy looked at Tang Xiu somewhat disappointedly and said, “She is too weak, Boss. Sparring with her is not the least bit challenging at all. Can I pass this?”</p><p>Tang Xiu’s smiling face turned thicker and he shot a teasing look toward Cheng Yannan.</p><p>In that instant, Cheng Yannan’s face turned beet red. The anger on her face turned thicker as she shouted, “You dare to look down on me, Tang Jin? Just wait, you’ll see how I can pack you up!”</p><p>She took two heavy breaths and then charged toward Tang Jin, deciding that she mustn’t take the boy lightly this time. But when her first was about to reach him, she suddenly felt her vision blur and piercing pain hit her chest in that instant. While feeling suffocated, her body was flying upside down and backward.</p><p>BAM…</p><p>As she heavily fell to the ground, turbulent dread now filled her heart although the pain was not unbearable. She wasn’t stupid. But only at this moment did she finally realize that Tang Jin’s speed was too fast. She wasn’t his opponent even though she unleashed everything she got.</p><p>However, the child was clearly a seven-plus-years-old boy! He couldn’t have such a formidable combat power even if he had been trained, right?</p><p>Tang Xiu waved to Tang Jin and signaled for him to return to the row. Then, he looked at Cheng Yannan and smilingly said, “How was it? Do you think these children are so easy to knock down now? That’s right, did you hear Tang Jin’s words? He doesn’t want to spar with you since the current you is too weak and literally pose no challenge, like, at all.”</p><p>Cheng Yannan was so furious and panted like she was going crazy. She never dreamed that a seven-plus-years-old child would be so powerful. She sternly glared at Tang Xiu and said aloud, “Tang… Sect Master, you must have made him come out intentionally, didn’t you? You already knew he was this strong, so you wanted him to make me frustrated and lose my spirit?”</p><p>“Hmph, I just said you can pick any of these nearly 1,000 children to be your sparring partner to accompany you to practice, didn’t I?” Tang Xiu retorted in disdain.</p><p>“No need!”</p><p>Cheng Yannan turned took at the children. She was adamant that Tang Xiu was deliberately saying that and thus, hinted the most powerful among these children to face her.</p><p>“You, come out!”</p><p>She pointed to a certain boy who was of similar seven-plus years of age at the forefront of the lineup.</p><p>“Can I refuse?” The boy looked a bit helpless. “You just sparred with Tang Jin and I’ve seen everything. You’re too weak. Having a spar with you will be really boring.”</p><p>His response made Cheng Yannan gasp with fury. Never once had it occurred to her that this boy would give her a cold shoulder just because she lost a moment ago.</p><p>That’s right! She got shut out and a cold shoulder response!</p><p>She, a 20-years-old adult and an ability user, was being looked down upon by a seven-plus-year-old child. This… this literally gave her no face at all!</p><p>“Just wait until I spank your but, Brat! I’ll make you cry!” Cheng Yannan yelled.</p><p>“Haih, since you wanna spar with me, then… please enlighten me.” The boy sighed after he saluted.</p><p><em>‘Bah, damn your enlightening!’</em></p><p>Cheng Yannan roared inwardly and charged towards the boy. She used her fastest speed and did not hold back anymore, unleashing everything to hit the boy.</p><p>BAM…</p><p>Still wearing a calm face, the boy delivered his punch in a similar fashion and met Cheng Yannan’s punch head-on. However, his body was firmly rooted on the ground, whereas Cheng Yannan was sent flying backward screaming yet again. This time, she fell even more miserably since half of her face landed first to swipe the ground, causing her eyes to turn blue after the fall.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
