You must have realized something after your last move, right?”</p><p>Daikura and Ozawa struggled hard to climb up from the floor. Both men exchanged fast glances, then the former stared daggers at Tang Xiu and asked, “Who exactly are you?”</p><p>A smile sketched on the corner of Tang Xiu’s mouth. He hooked a finger at Kuwako nearby. After she came to him, he gently put his hand on her shoulder and spoke to the two men smilingly, “You both are gonna die today, so I’ll do you a service to fulfill your curiosity. Kuwako, let them see what you look like.”</p><p>Kuwako let out a light smile and changed her appearance—a technique Tang Xiu taught her. She controlled her facial muscles and eventually restored her original looks.</p><p>“Have you both been well after our last meeting?”</p><p>“Kuwako Yamamoto?!”</p><p>“It’s you?!”</p><p>Daikura Sakuragi and Ozawa Manzo were both shocked and stared at Kuwako while realizing that they had fallen into the trap set by these people.</p><p>“Kuwako! Palace Master has sent Osashi to catch you. He even sent my immediate superior, Yuji for that. Shouldn’t you be chased by them now? How… H-how come you’re here?” asked Daikura angrily.</p><p>“Hehe.” Kuwako laughed and said, “You mentioned Yuji? Well, she’s already my Boss’ underling. If you wanna find Osashi, he’s already become a ghost and went to see the Gods already.”</p><p>“What did you say?”</p><p>A cold chill suddenly ran down Daikuragi’s back after hearing this. He knew Yuji’s identity; she had a prominent status in the Joyous Palace. If it wasn’t for the secretive nature of Joyous Palace that made most of its members unable to recognize each other, Yuji would definitely become an existence worth of respect by many people.</p><p><em>But… she’s obviously Miyaji’s mistress. How come she suddenly turns coat and becomes an underling of this brat in front? Did she betray Miyaji?</em></p><p>Tang Xiu lightly smiled and waved. “Well, you already know a lot of facts now, so you can die content, right? Xue Sha, Hei Xiong, deal with them.”</p><p>Upon hearing the command, Xue Sha and He Xiong instantly unleashed their immortal swords shot it toward the two men. At this time, the two men were already like dried-up lamps and severely injured. They were not Xue Sha’s and Hei Xiong’s opponents at all and took only two breaths for Xue Sha to impale Ozawa’s heart with his sword.</p><p>“You…”</p><p>Ozawa struggled to look down at the sword that pierced his heart, eyes filled with disbelief as he finally realized that the enemy he had beaten turned out to have been hiding his true strength all along.</p><p>Daikura faced Hei Xiong’s onslaught. Although he avoided his vital parts getting hit, he couldn’t avoid getting more injuries as well.</p><p>“You’ll all be buried with me!”</p><p>Suddenly, the fella no longer tried to avoid the onslaught and took out a metallic tube from his sleeve pocket after one of his arms was cut off. His finger pressed the button on it and immediately shot the flare into the sky.</p><p>Hei Xiong’s eyes lit up and manipulated the immortal sword to cut off the man’s head. Then, he quickly returned to Tang Xiu’s front and respectfully reported. “Sect Master, Daikura just sent a signal, and it’s likely those people from Joyous Palace will come here soon. Shall we withdraw now?”</p><p>“No rush.” Tang Xiu shook his head. “The Inada Society is a vassal force of Joyous Palace. Besides, Tang An has yet to finish neutralizing all the people here. Don’t get idle here and go help her. We can leave as soon as we’re done with it.”</p><p>“Roger!” The two men complied and immediately moved.</p><p>Five-plus minutes after, Tang Xiu quickly left the Inada Society and appeared on a six-story building about less than three kilometers away from the scene. Even the black-robed Tang An also appeared.</p><p><em>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</em></p><p>Three figures flickered and bolted fast from afar and soon came behind Tang Xiu. They were Mo Awu, Tang Guang, and Hei Wuya.</p><p>“Sect Master!” The three men respectfully greeted.</p><p>“How are things going with you guys?” asked Tang Xiu with a mile.</p><p>“It’s all been prepped and arranged, Grand Master,” reported Tang Guang respectfully. “We have a total of 46 sentries in the dark, all of which are managed by reliable people under Kuwako. We have a 10km radius under our surveillance, so we can spot any enemy who rushes here from any direction.”</p><p>“If so, then off you go!” Tang Xiu nodded and ordered.</p><p>“Copy that!”</p><p>Kuwako, who had changed her appearance again, along with Tang Guang, Mo Awu, Xue Sha, Hei Xiong, and Hei Wuya silently disappeared, leaving only Tang An alone with Tang Xiu.</p><p>“Well, do you think we can hook up a few big fishes, An?” asked Tang Xiu smilingly.</p><p>“I don’t know.” Tang An shook her head.</p><p>Tang Xiu shrugged and lightly smiled. “Daikura Sakuragi and Ozawa Manzo were members of the 72 Chess Pieces of the Joyous Palace, meaning they are also associated with other pieces. Even likely that they’re related to some other Mistresses.”</p><p>Tang An was silent for a few seconds. Her expression then slightly shifted as she smiled. “You’re correct, Grand Master. Some big fishes are already here.”</p><p>A faint smile on his face, Tang Xiu’s vision shifted to the distance starry sky, at the figure that was moving like a falling star. The person was wearing a red dress with red high heels. Even her long hair was also bleached red. Soon after, she casually descended in the Inada Society venue.</p><p>The woman’s title was Huoji. She was also a great personage and had a similar status as Yuji as Miyaji’s lover. At the moment, Huoji’s eyes were full of disbelief upon seeing the bodies lying in the courtyard. Then, her expression changed drastically after seeing Ozawa Manzo’s dead body.</p><p>“Big Brother!”</p><p>She instantly bolted towards Ozawa Manzo and knelt on the floor. Holding Ozawa’s dead body with shivering hands, two lines of tears ran down her face.</p><p><em>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</em></p><p>Three shadows flickered from a distance and quickly landed around her. All three of them were males in their 40s. Two of whom suppressed their shock upon seeing Huoji, cupped their fists and respectfully greeted. “Subordinate pays respect to Huoji.”</p><p>The other one was stunned and immediately followed the salute.</p><p>Flames of fury filling her eyes, Huoji’s vision fell on the three men and shouted, “Who killed them?”</p><p>The three men shook their heads.</p><p>“Investigate it thoroughly!” Huoji fiercely shouted, “I don’t care even if you must turn Kyoto upside down, but you must find the murderer! Those who provoke the Joyous Palace must die.”</p><p>“Understood!”</p><p>The three men hurriedly complied and took out their phones and began dialing some cell numbers. A few minutes after, they disappeared from the courtyard.</p><p>On the roof of a building in a distance, Tang Xiu slowly stroked his chin and thoughtfully said, “Yuji described some of the Mistresses in Joyous Palace, and this woman should be one of them with the Huoji title. Well, the other three just left, so it’s time to conclude this fishing session.”</p><p>“Let me deal with her, Grand Master,” said Tang An.</p><p>Tang Xiu squinted and nodded as he slowly said, “Your cultivation may be under that woman, but you should be able to easily kill her in a life-and-death battle. Go, then. I’ll help you so she can’t run away.”</p><p>Tang An nodded respectfully in response and then quickly disappeared and lurked towards Huoji.</p><p>Tang Xiu closely followed her and soon appeared on the outskirts of the Inada Society building. The moment he and Tang An entered the building, he began drawing an array pattern and set it up outside the Inada Society.</p><p><em>Puff…</em></p><p>An immortal sword suddenly appeared out of the blue and the sudden assassination strike directly stabbed Huoji’s left shoulder. Blood instantly spurted out and Tang An’s figure appeared.</p><p>“Who are you?”</p><p>Huoji’s expression enormously changed. Her heart palpitated upon finding the enemy suddenly appearing like that. She didn’t even notice anything when she appeared, which proved the enemy’s terrifyingness.</p><p>“Something’s wrong!”</p><p>Huoji suddenly noticed in surprise that the flow of energy in the surroundings had changed.</p><p>Tang An didn’t respond to Huoji’s remarks. She shot thousands of sword beams from her immortal sword and directly sealed off Houji’s every escape route.</p><p>“Mokugyo artifact!”</p><p>A wooden fish suddenly appeared in Huoji’s hand. As a hammer landed on the Mokugyo, a dazzling golden light suddenly burst from above. The golden light instantly spread in all directions and encased the sword beams within.</p><p><em>Cling, cling, cling…</em></p><p>Hundreds of golden fishes then appeared in the midst of golden light out of thin air and constantly clashed with the sword beams. The destructive sword beams which were originally full of momentum were dissolved in less than two breaths, then golden fishes stormed over towards Tang An.</p><p>If Yuji were to be here at this time, she would have been very shocked since this Mokugyou was the favorite artifact of Miyaji and was rumored to have enormous might.</p><p>“Ancestral Reverse of Myriad Swords!”</p><p>The routed sword beams appeared again and this time the number was several times more than before. Overlapping layers of sword images formed dense sword beams and covered the sky. Even the sword beams now encased several hundreds of meters radius, shrouding the golden fishes and destroying the golden fishes with its sword beams.</p><p>“Time-flow Reverse!”</p><p>Huoji beat the Mokugyo faster, but a bad feeling suddenly struck her heart. She felt like she was hallucinating that the time was flowing much slower and all the scenery around her turned blurry.</p><p><em>Puff…</em></p><p>The moment after, tens of sword beams pierced her chest and crushed her heart.</p><p>“How is this possible?”</p><p>Huoji was scared to death and hastily performed a secret art. The Buddhist Sarira in her body suddenly broke out and attempted to escape.</p><p><em>BOOM…</em></p><p>A transparent energy shield blocked her Buddhist Sarira’s path and it bounced back to her original position.</p><p>“Destroy…”</p><p>Tang An manipulated her immortal sword and accurately and unmistakably pierced the Golden Sarira. However, when a shrill scream came out of the Golden Sarira, Tang Xiu’s figure suddenly appeared and directly grabbed it.</p><p>“Why you didn’t let me destroy it, Grand Master?” asked Tang An with hesitation.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
