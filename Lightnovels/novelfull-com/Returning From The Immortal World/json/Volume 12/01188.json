The chance was high that the guy would storm over if he kept stimulating him. But the chief purpose of coming to this place was to lure a certain snake out of its hole and trap it like a turtle in a jar before catching it. Tang Xiu didn’t want to kill Mine Takeno before Ki Kitagawa came so as to avoid the latter noticing that something was amiss and decide not to come.</p><p>“Killing off an enmity is better than keeping it alive, huh? What a wise saying! Thanks a bunch for the advice and good lesson. Anyhow, I apologize for causing such a big scene here. People say grievances can be settled with wine and a meal, so shall this wine be on my tab for the purpose.” Looking apologetic, Tang Xiu patted his chest and spoke.</p><p>Mine Takeno was secretly relieved after hearing this. He was really afraid that this bastard would spit out something he couldn’t stand, for fear that he lost his patience and kill him.</p><p>“You came from afar, as a host, it’s just natural that I can’t let you be the party host, Mister. It’s all on me. However, please wait for a while for my men to clean up these bodies first.”</p><p>“Please.”</p><p>Tang Xiu nested himself on the sofa with a leg atop the other. After swinging his hand, he saw a few bottles of sealed beers lying on the floor next to the sofa and immediately picked up a bottle. He then opened the cap and leisurely drank it.</p><p>Time passed.</p><p>The tall and ferocious-looking Kumaji Mogu along with tens of stalwart men flushed into the nightclub in an aggressive manner. Upon seeing Mine Takeno directing his men to clean up dead bodies and bloodstains on the floor, he instantly shouted as loud as he could in fluent English, “HOLY COW!!! Which bastard bullied my buddy?!! That damn Inari Society? Where the fuck is that miscreant Head of Inari, Mine Takeno? This Big Daddy will definitely mutilate you today!”</p><p>Mine Takeno turned around and furrowed his brows after seeing Kumaji Mogu and the tens of men with earrings, bleached long hairs, and dressed in outlandish attire behind the guy. He fiercely shouted immediately, “What the hell are you running here for like some rabid dogs? Do you think this place is somewhere you can make trouble or something?”</p><p>“Heh, who the hell are you? Don’t tell me you’re that shitty bastard Mine Takeno, else I’m gonna blast your balls and cut your fucking head off.”</p><p>After saying that, he seemed to have caught sight of Tang Xiu and dashed towards him, asking aloud with concern, “It was all my fault, buddy. To think that somebody wronged you in my country… that was unexpected. I’m really sorry. Please don’t get mad. I’m gonna make whoever bully you pay the price. They can report to the Shinigami for all I care.”</p><p>A smile sported on Tang Xiu’s face while looking at this subordinate of Kuwako. He waved and shrugged and smilingly replied, “Well, things been dealt with already, Kumaji. We just killed those who bullied us. Just chill down and bear it, will you? That Mine Takeno is perhaps bad stuff, but he at least didn’t bully me. Hahaha…. Uh, well, it’s not like I hid it from you intentionally, though. It’s just… cough, cough, those who got killed were rather pitiful, so just help them out, Kumaji. They’re cleaning the bodies so we can have a meal and drinks here.”</p><p>Kumaji heavily nodded, then waved the machete in his hand and said loudly, “You can feel at ease since you didn’t bully my buddy. For the sake of God, seeing my friend getting bullied is something very unbearable to this Kumaji, especially when this buddy of mine comes from overseas. Brothers, you heard my friend, right? Alright, let’s help them deal with the bodies. Take out our secret weapon!”</p><p>Several young men took out a few porcelain bottles from their pockets and opened the cap as a pungent smell immediately wafted in all directions.</p><p>Kumaji also took out a porcelain bottle and quickly walked over to a corpse. Then, he poured a few drops of the liquid on it.</p><p>Bzzt…</p><p>That body began to melt and turned into a pungent liquid in just a few seconds.</p><p>“Holy cow! What demonic stuff is that?”</p><p>“You can melt the dead body just like that? I think I’ve heard about stuff like this, as in on TV?”</p><p>“Awesome.”</p><p>“…”</p><p>The men under Mine Takeno were dumbfounded and shocked upon witnessing how a dead body turned into a stinking liquid and couldn’t help but exclaim in shock. Even Mine Takeno himself was shocked by the stuff Kumaji just took out. It was something he had long heard of but never seen until now.</p><p>Quickly after, tens of dead bodies had been cleaned up. Even the floor was now spotless from any bloodstains. Those who were heavily injured had been taken, while tens of Mine Takeno’s men then came over to temporarily serve as waiters.</p><p>“I’m hungry, babe.”</p><p>Sitting on the sofa, Kuwako intentionally acted intimately to Tang Xiu and then pushed his hand around her. Her voice was extremely sweet and everyone 10 meters away from them could hear it clearly even though her voice was not loud.</p><p>Tang Xiu patted her shoulder and lightly smiled. “I’ll tell them to prepare a meal since you’re starving, honey. I’m gonna kill them if the taste doesn’t suit you.”</p><p>“Who do you wanna kill, huh?”</p><p>An extremely cold voice came from the corridor of the entrance to the dance room. Then, Ki Kitagawa strode into the dance room with his hands behind his back followed by four men. His frosty eyes swept over everyone inside and finally landed on Tang Xiu.</p><p>“You look a bit familiar… but I’m sure I’ve never seen you.”</p><p>Kitagawa spent some time to observe Tang Xiu and was finally sure that this fella was not that young man. He then came to Tang Xiu’s front and indifferently said, “This is my turf and Mine is the one who manages it for me. Yet, you killed many of his men and even provocatively shouted that you’re gonna kill Mine, huh? Do you think I’m just a fucking nobody here?”</p><p>Tang Xiu rolled his eyes at him and contemptuously said, “A desperado? Who and where the heck did you come from, buddy? Is there anything to do with me that Mine Takeno is managing your business and whatnot? He doesn’t even dare to fart before me, so how much better can you be than him, huh? Tell you one thing, mate. Crawl up and scram if you know your place. Else, don’t blame me for being merciless and make you at the border of life and death later.”</p><p>“What an unbridle brat!” Ki Kitagawa raised his thumbs up and sneered. “I hope you got what it takes for acting this arrogant.”</p><p>Tang Xiu pushed away Kuwako and got up, saying, “What do you want? You wanna fight? Relying on the fact you’re in your turf so you wanna bully a foreigner like me?”</p><p>A foreigner?!</p><p>Ki Kitagawa didn’t know Tang Xiu’s true identity, but just the word “foreigner” was enough to make all his wariness vanish. He instantly moved in a flash and slapped Tang Xiu’s chest. Any average man would directly die by his slap. Unfortunately, despite his confidence in his palm attack, Tang Xiu’s figure moved instantly and avoided it easily.</p><p>“What?!”</p><p>Disbelief was all over Ki Kitagawa’s face. He didn’t sense any aura of an expert from Tang Xiu whatsoever. The young man simply looked like a second-generation nouveau riche, and only those two sturdy men around him as well as some others who just barely entered the cultivation path, although it was just slightly better than nothing in his eyes.</p><p>Slash…</p><p>Tang Xiu instantly unleashed his divine weapon and cut off Kitagawa’s arm the moment he avoided the man’s strike, causing Kitagawa’s arm to fall on the cold floor.</p><p>“Goddammit!”</p><p>Ki Kitagawa’s expression drastically changed with a look of dread on his face. His figure instantly retreated backward all of a sudden. Regardless of how low or high his IQ was, he realized that he was very likely to have fallen into a trap that had been carefully set up for him.</p><p>“Who the hell are you, people?”</p><p>Kitagawa furiously roared after quickly sealing up the acupoints on his cut off arm to prevent the bleeding.</p><p>A sketch of a smile was painted on Tang Xiu’s face as he grabbed the hilt and grinningly smiled. “Well, well. We met just a while back Kitagawa. How can you not recognize me? Is it so easy for others to forget this Tang Xiu?”</p><p>Tang Xiu?!</p><p>Ki Kitagawa shuddered and instantly roared. “How cowardly you bastards are, Chinese cultivators! You wanna find trouble with me?”</p><p>Tang Xiu let out a thick smile and said, “Why bother targeting and making trouble for you? Don’t tell me you haven’t noticed it?”</p><p>As his voice faded away, flickering figures moved lightning-fast in the surroundings and sealed off the entire dance room’s exits. The auras exuded by these people were quite powerful, making Ki Kitagawa wary and vigilant even though he already knew that Tang Xiu brought some experts with him.</p><p>“You all…”</p><p>Lips shivering, Kitagawa tried to speak but the words were stuck in his throat.</p><p>“Amitabha.”</p><p>Blackface Buddha treaded forward a few steps and slowly spoke, “I don’t care whether you’re from the Joyous Palace or the Gene Camp, but you definitely have done some sinister and wicked deeds. You should go straight to hell to confess for your sins and bear the punishment!”</p><p>“Monks?!”</p><p>A trace of confusion was seen on Ki Kitagawa’s face. Never once had it occurred to him that monks would be among these Chinese cultivators. Could it be…</p><p>“Are you guys… from China’s Buddhist Sect?”</p><p>At this moment, Ki Kitagawa felt like he had fallen into a glacier hole and was completely terrified. He was once a member of the Joyous Palace and naturally knew its conflict with the Buddhist Sect in China. The first rule decreed by the Joyous Palace Master was either to directly run away or fight to the death should they run into the Buddhist Sect. It was through this rule that he learned how deep the enmity between both parties was.</p><p>Tang Xiu clapped and smilingly said, “Well, you’ve been on an undercover mission and lurked inside the Joyous Palace for so many years, Kitagawa. You’ve been working for General Fukuda as well, so I’m sure you’re a smart man. Cast away any thoughts to resist and just surrender yourself. You won’t be able to escape since we have set up an inescapable net for you.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
