But as he instantly released his perception, his furrowed brows stretched and he smiled. “You came with my father. But what happened, though?”</p><p>One of the big men respectfully said, “Young Master Tang, our cargo ship was robbed at sea. Our investigation found the other party isn’t a pirate but a foreign force who has been targeting us… the Ingres Firm.”</p><p><em>‘Ingres Firm?!’</em></p><p>The name was vaguely familiar to Tang Xiu, but he couldn’t pinpoint where he had heard it from. Since he was unable to recall it, he waved and gestured the two men to leave, and then entered the villa alone. He bumped into a housemaid who was cleaning the interior and then went to the study on the second floor after greeting her.</p><p><em>Knock, knock…</em></p><p>Tang Xiu knocked on the door and then pushed it. He saw his father, Tang Yunde, frowning deeply and didn’t hear him knocking, submerged in his own thoughts. He immediately let out a smile and said, “What are you thinking about, Dad? You seem spellbound by something.”</p><p>Tang Yunde immediately came back to his senses. After seeing Tang Xiu who just appeared in front of him, he looked a bit happy and asked, “Did you just come back? Aren’t you supposed to be in Nine Dragons Island now?”</p><p>“Everything there has been arranged, so I naturally came back to handle something,” said Tang Xiu smilingly. “Anyhow, you seem to have bumped into some accidents here, though?”</p><p>“Some people are destined to be enemies in life, though I didn’t expect them to be rabid dogs.” Tang Yunde sighed helplessly. “They still aggressively charge forward to bite once their target appears even if we never hint nor try to be enemies with them. The losses this time were not big, but some of our men died.”</p><p>“Was it done by the Ingres Firm?” asked Tang Xiu curiously.</p><p>“Huh? How did you know?” Tang Yunde was stunned and immediately asked.</p><p>“I just bumped into your men in the courtyard, Dad,” said Tang Xiu.</p><p>Tang Yunde quickly understood and then forced a smile. “Yeah, those people from the Ingres Firm are the culprits. It’s a company that relies entirely on arms sales. To be more precise, they are House Dolan’s, since the real person in charge of Ingres Firm is one of the top three men in House Dolan, Anmoore Dolan.”</p><p>It was then that Tang Xiu realized why he felt this Ingres Firm sounded familiar just now. There was a record on this Ingres Firm when he previously investigated House Dolan. However, there was only a scant number of information on it, while the person in charge was also very low-key.</p><p>Tang Xiu slightly furrowed his brows and asked, “Is there any chance House Dolan got the news that you’re still alive?”</p><p>“I also think that it should be the case.” Tang Yunde nodded. “House Dolan lost big time in past incidents, especially after we killed their most favored scion. They kinda put us as a thorn in their eyes and just couldn’t wait to eliminate us quickly.”</p><p>Tang Xiu curled his mouth upward and asked, “Well, do you know who’s the most favored scion of House Dolan now, Dad?”</p><p>Tang Yunde was stunned, then he immediately let out a bitter smile. “Had you asked me about that a few days ago, I wouldn’t have been able to answer. However, since the incident where my cargo ship was hijacked, I contacted the head operatives of the Darkwind organization in China. I got the info from him that the most favored scion of House Dolan now is their most outstanding junior called Angelo Dolan.”</p><p>Without inquiring more detailed info about House Dolan, Tang Xiu said with a chilling tone, “Angelo Dolan is dead along with dozens of genetic warriors from the SOE company. That was the interest they paid for the debt they owe you from the past! But I wanna know about the situation about this Darkwind organization in the mainland, Dad.”</p><p>An inconceivable look on his face, Tang Yunde asked in surprise, “What did you just say? Angelo Dolan is dead? How can that be?”</p><p>“He brought a lot of experts with him to Saipan and severely injured some of my men. Then, I made a very powerful person submit to me and successfully found his location with his help. House Dolan no longer has an Angelo Dolan from now on.”</p><p>Tang Yunde looked at his son deeply. Then, he raised a thumbs up and praised. “I killed their most favored scion in the past, and now my son followed suit. I really didn’t just lay in bed for two decades in vain. Anyhow, what do you wanna do with the Darkwind organization, though?”</p><p>“This Darkwind organization is hidden in every corner of the world, and I feel they are like cancer,” said Tang Xiu calmly. “They sold info about me once to others, so I obliterated that branch. Additionally, I also removed their branch in Saipan.”</p><p>“You shouldn’t act too recklessly, Son.” Tang Yunde gasped in horror. “The Darkwind may only be an intelligence agency, but rumors have it that it’s stronger than the top three major organizations in the world. The extent of its hidden forces is still in the dark, and nobody could figure it out until now.”</p><p>“Heh, don’t you think you’ll still be under their tabs for whatever you do in the future, Dad?” Tang Xiu sneered.</p><p>“This…” Tang Yunde hesitated a bit and helplessly said, “But then again, we got no other choice! The Darkwind has been in existence for centuries. Members of this organization rarely show their faces and are like mice, hiding in dark corners and constantly developing their intelligence network. Even the intelligence networks of various countries around the world can’t contend with it.”</p><p>“It’s exactly because the Darkwind’s intel network is too strong that it’s necessary to get rid of and replace them, Dad.” Tang Xiu sneered. “Besides, I’ve already prepared many arrangements, so you can rest assured about it! That’s why I can tell you that I’m sure to completely obliterate this organization from the face of Earth even if we lose all decorum with them now.”</p><p>Tang Yunde had heard about the establishment of the Tang Sect by Tang Xiu. He also heard that his son had brought a lot of experts to kill demonic beasts in the Himalayas and his great military exploits. He knew his son was very strong, still, his son’s words sent a quake in his heart.</p><p><em>‘Destroying the Darkwind organization? If my son can destroy this organization, then, does he have the power to reach the top of the pyramid in the world?’</em></p><p>“I’ve assigned people to establish an intelligence network myself, Dad.” Tang Xiu went on. “I’ll also increase my investment in this endeavor, so I’ll be able to compile a huge information network around the world within three years. I won’t only remove House Dolan, but will also disintegrate this Darkwind organization and make them disappear from the world.”</p><p>“How confident are you, exactly, Son?” asked Tang Yunde hastily.</p><p>“100%,” answered Tang Xiu solemnly.</p><p>Tang Yunde got up from the sofa abruptly, looking ecstatic as he said aloud, “You’re great, Son! You’re truly much better than your old man. Anyhow, come with me to a certain place. There’s something I need to tell you, and I want you to have some people too.”</p><p>Tang Xiu was stunned. “Huh? You got something I still don’t know about, Dad?”</p><p>Tang Yunde grinned. “I may have been lying in the hospital bed for many years, but is there anyone who has no secret? Before I got hit so badly that it caused me to go vegetative, I’ve actually been preparing for revenge. Although I’ve been staying in Star City, on the one hand, it was due to my disappointment, while on the other hand, was the concern about your mother. But still, how can a man not demand the due debt people owe him, no?”</p><p>Tang Xiu’s eyes lit up as he nodded and said, “Alright. I’m going with you.”</p><p>****</p><p>Jingning District, Shanghai.</p><p>As a black SUV slowly entered a factory gate, Tang Xiu, who was sitting in the car, looked pensive because there were more than ten security guards at the gate. All of them looked ordinary and didn’t emit out a strong aura, yet each and every shadow of the soldiers loomed over every action they did.</p><p>He was also keenly aware of many people lurking in the hidden corners in the surroundings. He had released his perception and found nearly 50 experts in a few hundreds of meters radius.</p><p>“The place is tightly guarded, Dad.” Tang Xiu turned to look at the calm-looking Tang Yunde and spoke slowly.</p><p>“That’s certain, Son.” Tang Yunde smilingly said, “This place is my biggest secret and also my biggest card. I know some layouts of our family, but even my father doesn’t know what I’ve arranged here. Back when in Star City, I didn’t expect House Dolan to sniff my track, so I only felt a little danger, hence causing my negligence. Otherwise, if I were to bring a lot of manpower to strike House Dolan’s men lurking in China, it would have been very difficult to say who’d come out the victor.”</p><p>Tang Xiu’s face slightly shifted and he nodded wordlessly.</p><p>“Hmm?”</p><p>When the black SUV stopped at the square outside the warehouse, Tang Xiu saw five men and women coming out of the warehouse, one of whom was a young woman he had seen before.</p><p>“Brother Tang.”</p><p>“Uncle Tang.”</p><p>Ni Penggang went forward to greet Tang Yunde with a big hug, while Ni Jie behind him called out respectfully.</p><p>“This is the first time seeing your Little Jie after I woke up, isn’t it, Penggang?” said Tang Yunde. “I never thought the little lassie from that year has grown up now. She looks so much like you, very beautiful.”</p><p>“Haha, if you think she’s a beauty, why don’t you take her as the Tang Family’s daughter-in-law then, Brother?” Ni Penggang smilingly said, “Anyway, I’ve long heard about the well-known name of my nephew, Tang Xiu.”</p><p>Tang Yunde burst into laughter. Then, he turned to Tang Xiu and said, “Xiu’er, this is the brother who has faced dangers and braved death with me numerous times in the past, and that one is his daughter, Ni Jie. Penggang is one of our own and someone who we can entrust our back to.”</p><p>“Uncle Ni, Sister Jie, how do you do?” Tang Xiu greeted respectfully.</p><p>“I just knew it when your old man called me, Tang Xiu.” Ni Penggang smilingly said, “I thought that we would just continue lying low for a long time to come. That’s why I never thought you’ve grown up to be so powerful in such a short time and made your old man bring you here. Let’s go inside! I’ll take you to see some people who will become your most loyal men in the future.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
