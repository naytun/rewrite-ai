His eyes were trained on the plaque of the store written with golden characters that looked particularly striking under the reflection from the distant lights: The God’s Nectar 06.</p><p>God’s Nectar! It had become the wine—a product from the Magnificent Tang Corp.—regarded as absolutely the king of wines that no other brand could compare, but it was also very expensive with a bottle priced at five figures.</p><p>Li Yuquan himself had tasted this God’s Nectar from his old superior who had obtained two bottles from some unknown channels. He and his squad won the award and praise due to their excellent accomplishment and thus, the group of seven drank a bottle of it.</p><p>It made him wish and dream to taste another bottle of God’s Nectar since.</p><p>He was now perfectly aware that he could no longer obtain money from the auction organizer given what happened there. Still, he was in dire need of cash and repeatedly racked his brain about it. Eventually, his attention turned to this God’s Nectar exclusive store. Before he handed the Aeroglider to the auctioneer, he actually left another way out for this matter, which was to rob God’s Nectar exclusive store.</p><p>It was the best way to get the needed money. He could just snatch some boxes of God’s Nectar and leave straight after even if he didn’t get a dime here. As long as he had this wine, he believed there would be numerous wealthy people who’d love to buy it.</p><p>After a few minutes, he silently arrived in the back alley of the store. He looked around for a while before his strong figure instantly dashed and quickly appeared by the second floor’s window. With a sharp blade in hand, he easily unlocked it.</p><p>“The batch of God’s Nectar shipment arrived yesterday is definitely not sold out yet. This kind of store usually will reserve the next batch of wine in case of some particular circumstances. Further, that armored truck which usually comes in the afternoon shouldn’t have taken all the money out of the store.</p><p>“It’s just 2 million. But I must get the money.”</p><p>After he entered the room, he observed around and found that it was a storage room. To put all the sundries, so he quietly came to the door and opened it a bit to observe the outside. There was nobody in the corridor outside and the entire interior of the store was dark.</p><p>Immediately, he went out but didn’t realize that just as he had just snuck in, a black shadow had also silently entered the room and followed him without any noise.</p><p>After the constant observation and searching, Li Yuquan soon found the storage on the second floor. There were 60 boxes, and they hadn’t been unsealed yet and were just neatly placed near the wall. However, he didn’t directly steal them away as they were his last resort, so he kept looking around and finally found the office.</p><p>“The safe is really hidden.”</p><p>Behind a row of bookshelves, Li Yuquan found the safe behind the painting hanging on the wall. Luckily, he was an expert at dealing with safes. Taking out a wire, he bent it and inserted it into the safe and quickly cracked the first lock. The subsequent safety lock was the fingerprint verification and some digital passwords, which he completely cracked with various means. And finally, the safe’s door was slowly opened.</p><p>“Only this much?”</p><p>He observed it a few times and was finally sure that the cash in the safe was about 300,000 or so. Still 1.7 million from the 2 million he needed!</p><p>“Alas, it seems I can only steal some God’s Nectar. Ten boxes should be enough, and the car I brought here can only carry that much. But leaving Shanghai will likely be very difficult, and I’ll be easily found out if I sell this stuff here.” Li Yuquan sighed and muttered to himself.</p><p>Suddenly, a cold voice came from behind him. “Then don’t waste your effort since it’s not easy to get out of Shanghai.”</p><p>“Who is it?”</p><p>Li Yuquan’s fine hairs erected and he instantly pulled his sharp Mitsubishi army knife the moment he turned around. The room was dim, but he clearly saw a man leaning on the gate.</p><p>“I’m just the security guard of this store.”</p><p>The middle-aged man faintly smiled while thinking to himself: <em>I should be awarded for catching a powerful thief, right? Unlike those inner court disciples of the Tang Sect who can easily buy medicinal pills from the sect, I spent quite the effort to get them a few days ago. Only after I taking out all my money and asking help from an inner disciple was I finally able to buy the pills. And now, I’m as poor as a rag!</em></p><p>Holding the Mitsubishi army knife across his chest, Li Yuquan coldly said, “I don’t wanna hurt or kill anyone. But I’m in dire need of cash, so I hope you don’t stop or fight me. I’ll just tie you up and you’ll be naturally be freed tomorrow morning when the other staffers arrive.”</p><p>Wen Liang squinted and lightly smiled. “You should be a soldier if my guess is correct, no? Also, you’ve just left the army recently since the soldier smell in you hasn’t been washed up by ordinary life either. Alright, I’ll let you go this once since you’re just like me who also came out of the army. But you must promise me to never do such as stealing from now on.”</p><p>Li Yuquan stared blankly for a moment and immediately replied coldly, “I need the money and quite a lot of it in the shortest time! This place is one of the best answers for me, yet do you think you can deal with me?”</p><p>“Hehehe, is it difficult to deal with you, though?” asked Wen Liang back smilingly.</p><p>“I’m too lazy to waste my energy bickering with you.” Li Yuquan sneered. “Either let me tie you up or forcefully get submitted, you choose!”</p><p>“Come, bring it on.” Wen Liang smilingly hooked his fingers in response.</p><p>“Humph…”</p><p>Li Yuquan snorted and his body dashed lightning-fast and instantly appeared in front of Wen Liang. As his Mitsubishi army knife targeted the man’s right shoulder, his other fist also delivered a punch.</p><p>“The army boxing, huh? Were you from the Blue Eagle special force?”</p><p>While avoiding the Mitsubishi knife and clashing, Wen Liang let Li Yuquan’s fist hit his body to no effect. It was Li Yuquan who was surprised and paced back four steps.</p><p>Eyes shrunk and looking incredulous, Li Yuquan felt like his fist just punched a hard stone. The pain in his bones gave him a chill. Stopping, he shot a vigilant look at Wen Liang and asked in a deep voice, “Who are you? Only a handful of people know this army boxing style, which unique style belongs to the Blue Eagle special force. How do you know it?”</p><p>“Because… I used to be a member of the Blue Eagle special force,” replied Wen Liang faintly.</p><p>“That’s impossible!” Li Yuquan glowered. “I’ve served in the Blue Eagle for four years and even promoted to be its captain. But I’ve never seen you at all. Hold up, your age… you were definitely one of the former senior members. But how did you become a security guard here?”</p><p>“Do you think it’s shameful working as a security guard?” asked Wen Liang back. “I’m afraid that tons of people want to snatch this position yet can’t get it either way! But it’s you, an elite that came out from the Blue Eagle special force, that needs scrutiny. You actually did this kind of shameful thing?! You literally made the Blue Eagles lose face!”</p><p>Li Yuquan felt his face burn with shame. He wanted to argue to defend himself but swallowed all the works back into his belly as they were about to be blurted out.</p><p>“I’m short on money,” muttered Li Yuquan. It was a statement hard to speak out.</p><p>“Heh, tons of people are short on money, yet it doesn’t mean it gives them the reason to steal!” Wen Liang sneered. “Let me tell you, you’ve been recorded in the security footage ever since you appeared outside the store, including everything you’ve done after you entered the store. That’s why I was gonna let you leave and delete the footage on you. Yet you attacked me and even used that Mitsubishi shit. No way I can just let you go that easily now.”</p><p>“You were once a senior member of the squad and I respect you for that,” replied Li Yuquan coldly. “I don’t want to fight you anymore, but I’m in dire need of cash, so I can only say sorry.”</p><p>Eyebrows raised up, Wen Liang instantly appeared in front of Li Yuquan and delivered a blitz punch to his chest while his left leg sent a whipping kick that smacked the man’s face. He followed Li Yuquan closely even after the man was knocked down and directly apprehended him, picked up a rope and tied him up in the corner.</p><p>“This is your last chance. Tell me, why are you stealing?! Don’t gimme that short on money excuse! Just spit it out. Why are you short on money, exactly?”</p><p>Never in Li Yuquan’s life was he this scared before. He had been very confident in his own strength, especially combat. He won the championship in the army and had been crowned as the king of fighting by many people. Yet, he couldn’t even fight back the middle-aged man in front of him and had been completely routed easily instead. Was… this… even possible?</p><p>Could it be that… the former senior members of the Blue Eagle special force were such dreadful fighters?</p><p>“I need money to save my wife and kid.” Li Yuquan was silent for a few minutes and replied with gritted teeth and an unwilling face.</p><p>“Come again? You need 2 million yuan to save your wife and kid?” Wen Liang sneered.</p><p>“Huh? Have you been right behind me ever since I came inside?” Li Yuquan blurted out in surprise.</p><p>“Yup.” Wen Liang nodded.</p><p>With a respectful face, Li Yuquan replied, “I really can’t understand why the Blue Eagle special force just let you leave like that give your strength. Anyhow, I told you the truth. I really need 2 million yuan since I don’t have much time. I’ll give that bastard the money the moment I got it, and only then will he let my wife and kid go.”</p><p>“And, who exactly is this <em>bastard</em> ?” asked Wen Liang with a frown.</p><p>“Chang Zhao, Chang Guoxin’s nephew,” answered Li Yuquan.</p><p>Wen Liang’s eyes flickered and he slowly said, “Chang Guoxin, huh? He was a senior colonel then, so he should have some stars on his shoulders now, shouldn’t he? But I don’t think his nephew is in the military, though. That’s why I’m curious, why did his nephew kidnap your wife and kid, and also want you to pay 2 million as their ransom?”</p><p>“That’s because I’m the victim of the factional battle,” said Li Yuquan coldly.</p><p>Wen Liang nodded in response and brought his phone out. He dialed a cell number and spoke after the other party connected, “Cap’, God’s Nectar Store 06 just got a special situation, so I need you to come here.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
