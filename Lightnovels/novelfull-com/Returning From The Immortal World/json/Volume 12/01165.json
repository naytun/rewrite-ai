It was also thanks to her wisdom that the latter also feared her and thus sent her out to deal with the issues on the front lines.</p><p>Prior to this, it was Tang Xiu’s strength that made her apprehensive, yet she didn’t choose to betray the Joyous Palace Master even though she faced the threat of death. She did agree to submit to Tang Xiu orally but was very resistant to the idea inwardly. Even after getting the treatment, she had already planned to challenge Tang Xiu to probe his strength further, while at the same time, prepping her escape at any time.</p><p>At this moment, however, her heart went cold as only now did she realize that this young Chinese cultivator not only had cultivated his strength to the extreme but also had frightening wisdom. He seemed to be able to see through her intentions and arranged the array while she was recuperating.</p><p><em>What should I do? Do I really have to submit to him?</em></p><p><em>But how should I deal with the restriction seal cast on me, then? I may be able to suppress it temporarily if I do choose to escape. But the seal will definitely affect me after some time. I’m gonna lose my mind by then and nothing I can do but die at that time.</em></p><p>Tang Xiu, still sitting cross-legged on the big bluestone, calmly observed Yuji’s grim and ugly expression. Afterward, he slowly asked during her silence, “Do you know why haven’t I pressed you for an answer about the situation in your Joyous Palace before?”</p><p>With a thoughtful look, Yuji answered, “You thought that I can’t escape?”</p><p>“That’s only one of many reasons.” Tang Xiu shook his head. “But not the main one.”</p><p>“So what’s the reason, then?” asked Yuji with a frown.</p><p>“When I freed you from my sealing technique, I also cast another one on you. It’s just that you didn’t notice it. Of course, I also noticed the other restriction that has been cast on you previously. My guess is that restriction must be cast by the Joyous Palace Master on you, so as to prevent you from betraying them.”</p><p>“You can detect it?” exclaimed Yuji in surprise.</p><p>“If I proclaim myself to be the first in magical and secret arts, I dare say nobody dares to aim for the second in this world. Such a minor seal cast by some Buddhist cultivator at the Spirit Formation Stage is nothing but a joke to me. Removing it is very easy to be done.” Tang Xiu sneered.</p><p>Only now did Yuji’s expression drastically changed. She stared at Tang Xiu and said, “I’ll sell you this life of mine if you really can remove this seal cast by the Joyous Palace Master.”</p><p>“Don’t say it like your life is valuable to me.” Tang Xiu shook his head. “Just your current level of cultivation, many of the men under me will reach this level a few years. The sole reason I haven’t killed you and even wasted medicinal pills is chiefly for the intention to make you help Kuwako to handle her affairs in Japan. Do you really think I’ve fallen for you otherwise, huh?”</p><p>Yuji fell into silence. She knew almost nothing about Tang Xiu. Naturally, she had no idea whether Tang Xiu was saying the truth. But one thing was certain. This Chinese cultivator in front of her was the most dreadful person she’d ever met. Even the Joyous Palace Master was likely under him.</p><p>“So, who is this Master of Joyous Palace, then?” asked Tang Xiu in a deep voice.</p><p>Yuji herself actually didn’t want to answer the questioning as she hadn’t yet gotten Tang Xiu’s promise. But after recalling how terrifying this man was, and the fact she couldn’t escape, she finally decided to gamble. She replied in a deep voice, “I’m not particularly clear about his identity, either. I only know that he came to Japan about a century ago, and then established the Joyous Palace from scratch on his own. Rumors have it that he appeared as a monk in public when he first came to Japan then.”</p><p>Suddenly, she seemed to recall something else and added more, “That’s right, there’s another thing. He should be from China since he spoke Chinese when he just came here. After living here for some time, only then did he gradually learn Japanese.”</p><p>“My guess is, he should be from the Joyous Sect. I once heard from a friend in the cultivation world that the Buddhist Tantric school has a splinter group called Joyous Sect or something. Unfortunately, the principle and essential teaching of this sect is like day and night with the Buddhist sects and thus, the rest of the Buddhist sects can no longer tolerate and accommodate it, resulting in the incident where all the members of Joyous Sect were either killed or discarded. It’s very likely that your Joyous Palace Master is the surviving member of that Joyous Sect.”</p><p>As he spoke up to there, he took out a mobile phone and dialed Miao Wentang’s number. After the latter picked up his call, he spoke, “I need your help, Brother Miao.”</p><p>“On what issue?” replied Miao Wentang. “Just tell me and I’ll do it as long as it’s within my ability.”</p><p>“We had a chat before and you mentioned some issues pertaining to the Buddhist sects,” said Tang Xiu. “I want you to make a trip to the Buddhist Sect in person and tell them about some issues.”</p><p>“And, what issue is it, exactly?” asked Miao Wentang.</p><p>“Some surviving members of Joyous Sect are in Japan and one of them is very powerful,” explained Tang Xiu. “His cultivation level is on par with cultivators at the Spirit Formation Stage and perhaps even stronger. The most important thing is, he also has terrifying influence and power here, which is said to be the biggest and most mysterious force in Japan.”</p><p>“The Joyous Sect?” Miao Wentang exclaimed in surprise. “This sect was like a bunch of ravishers in the past and ruined many women’s chastities. I never thought some members of this sect were still alive. It’s really out of my imagination. Brother Tang, the Buddhist school have long spread out the news that they would kill any remnants of Joyous Sect whenever they meet them. Alright, I’ll hurry up to the Buddhist sect right away to inform its current head, Grand Abbot Bright Crane.”</p><p>“Thanks a bunch!” replied Tang Xiu.</p><p>After hanging up, he looked at Yuji again and faintly said, “You still have two choices ahead of you, and it’s also your last chance. Surrender and assist Kuwako in Japan, or refuse and die here and now.”</p><p>“Do I even have any other choice?” replied Yuji bitterly.</p><p>“You already know you have none, so just submit,” replied Tang Xiu indifferently.</p><p>“I’ll submit and give you my life as long as you can solve the seal cast on my body.” Yuji nodded.</p><p>“You’re willing to hand over your life to me, so I’ll take it and put another seal on you while removing that seal on your body,” said Tang Xiu.</p><p>“You…” Yuji looked indignant.</p><p>“Heh, I also got the seal cast on me by Sect Master.” Kuwako sneered. “Do you think you have more face than me or something? Let me tell you, it’s already a huge benevolence from Sect Master to keep you alive.”</p><p>Again, Yuji fell silent.</p><p>Tang Xiu then spoke indifferently, “As long as you choose to submit to me, you can expect to have continuous progress in the future and even be able to surpass the Joyous Palace Master later. I may have no other things, but I have lots of elixir and miraculous medicines. Make contributions and you can get more of those things. The more contributions you make, the more you can get and the better your cultivation will become.”</p><p><em>‘Elixir and miraculous pills?’</em></p><p>Yuji recalled the Holy Healing pill Tang Xiu gave her. Its efficacy was truly remarkable as new flesh had started to regrow in her seriously stabbed wounds, while the seriously injured internal organs had been similarly healed. Additionally, that medicinal bath she had, it was like tempering and quenching her physique, which now made it at least 10% stronger than before.</p><p>“I submit.” Yuji kowtowed.</p><p>Tang Xiu nodded. After checking out and deactivating the seal cast on Yuji’s body, he faintly said, “I can’t remove the seal the Joyous Palace Master has cast on you right now. He will notice once I do that. But no worries about it, though. I’ll naturally help you out once he’s dead.”</p><p>“But if he dies, I can’t live either,” cut Yuji hurriedly.</p><p>“I already know the mantra he has cast on you. It is very vicious as your life depends on his. He dies and you’ll be dead; he lives and so do you. He can also control your life and death easily,” said Tang Xiu lightly. “But you can rest assured on that issue, though. I have a way to preserve your life.”</p><p>Yuji was secretly relieved after hearing this. Then, she respectfully said, “Tang… what I should I address you, though?”</p><p>“Just call me Boss!” replied Tang Xiu lightly.</p><p>“Roger that, Boss.” Yuji nodded.</p><p>“Anyway, tell me the general picture of the Joyful Palace,” said Tang Xiu. “How many people it has and how huge its influence and power in Japan are, exactly?”</p><p>“What I know is just a scant picture of it. None in the Joyous Palace aside from Miyaji really knows the complete situation there,” answered Yuji. “But I do know some general structure inside. The Joyous Palace has four Elders who are Miyaji’s trusted confidantes and they also came with him to Japan. Below the four Elders are 36 Celestial Mistresses, which I happen to be one, and 72 Chess Pieces below them. Among those 72, I only know Osashi Kitagishi and another one, but I know not about the rest of them.”</p><p>“And, who’s this other Chess Piece, then?” asked Tang Xiu.</p><p>“It’s Daikura Sakuragi, the Head of the Inada Society,” answered Yuji.</p><p>“Inada Society?” Tang Xiu turned to Kuwako.</p><p>Kuwako respectfully explained, “The Inada Society is a very famous dojo in Japan, Sect Master. I never thought its Dojocho, Daikura Sakuragi, turns out to be someone from Joyous Palace, though. I once sparred with him. He does have remarkable strength. However, he also loves money and is a womanizer.”</p><p>Tang Xiu nodded in response and said, “Kuwako, this Joyous Palace Master has noticed you, so you’re to stay low for now! Also, order all your subordinates who are not exposed to continue doing their routines. It’s fine if you want to leave Japan for some time too.”</p><p>Kuwako hesitated and said, “My people will be fine as long as Yuji doesn’t move, though.”</p><p>“I’m Boss’s underling now, so I naturally can’t betray you or you men.” Yuji hastily interjected.</p><p>Tang Xiu calmly said, “Yuji, I want you to do something…”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
