Several hundreds of meters away from the speedboat was a liner where Tang Xiu was standing quietly on the bow deck with hands behind his back, watching the speedboat gradually disappear at the horizon.</p><p>“Do you really feel at ease, Sect Master?”</p><p>Mo Awu looked a bit different. He knew very well about Will Art. He never believed that this fella would just honestly keep his word.</p><p>Tang Xiu sported a smile and asked, “Do you know why I let that old devil leave with Will Art?”</p><p>“You don’t want to bring Demonfreak geezer to Nine Dragons Island?” asked Mo Awu.</p><p>“That’s one reason,” replied Tang Xiu lightly. “Demonfreak geezer isn’t one of ours yet. Even if he is sincere to work for us, it will take a long time to test him. Nine Dragons Island is our stronghold and the holy ground of the Tang Sect. It must not be easily exposed before we have become the most powerful force in the world.”</p><p>“Then, about the other reason…” continued Mo Awu.</p><p>“Demonfreak geezer knows we are powerful. Furthermore, his life is literally under my control, so he naturally won’t dare to betray me so easily,” said Tang Xiu. “I made him leave with Will Art, on the one hand, to restrain him, while on the other hand, he can act as a supervisor to control Will Art. My strength may deter this old devil and it’s the reason why he became my underling, but wanting him to be loyal will be very difficult. More than that, I know he wants to be stronger. I can give him that chance. Using threats and enticement will make it easier for me to control him.”</p><p>“Well, it seems impossible to me that that old devil can easily escape from your palm, Sect Master.” Mo Awu caught the gist suddenly and smiled.</p><p>“There’s nothing absolute in this world, Awu.” Tang Xiu shook his head and said, “Don’t forget that Golden Armored Zombie back when we were in Western China. I cast the same seal on him, yet he ultimately chose to betray me.”</p><p>Mo Awu’s countenance turned a bit solemn. He nodded and said, “The longer old freaks live, the more their selfishness. I understand what you mean, Sect Master.”</p><p>“We got the entire Saipan under our control now, so we can put away the issues here for a while.” Tang Xiu smiled. “Let’s go back to Nine Dragons Island and deal with the things there first before I return to China.”</p><p>****</p><p>The fast-moving speedboat quickly broke the waves and sailed toward Saipan. At this time, a strange expression was evident on Will Art’s face. He didn’t spare a glance at the four seriously injured men but stared at Demonfreak geezer for a long time.</p><p>“Is that enough for you, Kiddo?”</p><p>Demonfreak geezer took out a cigar case and fished a cigar from the inside. After he lit it up and took some puffs, he leisurely spoke.</p><p>“I believe we’re already friends since I’ve already become Mr. Tang’s partner, Demonfreak geezer.” Will Art smiled. “But still, I’m really curious. Angelo Dolan thought that you were a friend. He even looked so happy that you’d come then, but why did you choose to betray him?”</p><p>Demonfreak geezer rolled his eyes and said, “What’s wrong in following an expert? Tang Xiu is a powerful man, and he is likely to have an enormous power behind him as well. That’s why he’s qualified to make work for him. Besides, I must correct you on a fact—Angelo Dolan has never been my friend. He never regarded me like one, and there was only cooperation between us.”</p><p>Will Art shook his head and said, “That’s not what I mean. You’re not as simple as a friend for him. I heard from Angelo that there had been quite some confidential cooperations between you both then.”</p><p>A cold light flashed in Demonfreak’s eyes as he said coldly, “It was indeed a secret to outsiders, but it’s no secret for me now. I can tell you about that if you wanna know. I’m the one who contributed the most to the research on genetic warriors in the secret lab of House Dolan. Moreover, I also mastered the formula.”</p><p>His countenance changing, Will Art vigilantly stared at Demonfreak geezer. “What do you mean by that? Don’t forget that I have a cooperation with Mr. Tang. He’ll be very furious if you dare to mess with me.”</p><p>Demonfreak geezer just glanced at him casually in response and said in contempt, “I already knew all along that you’re not some good shit, Boy. Though I didn’t expect you to have a head full of bad thoughts. Anyhow, you guessed right. I dare tell you that I want to kill you. Only, you threatened me with Tang Xiu and that made me feel a bit thorny. So tell me, should I kill you or not?”</p><p>Will Art was inwardly shaken. He may still have confidence if his four men were not injured. But they were badly injured and he himself wasn’t this Demonfreak geezer’s match at all. Hence, he secretly regretted stirring up a hornet nest before.</p><p>What should I do? Should I just sit and wait for death?</p><p>He suddenly felt like he was just falling into an illusion where he just escaped from the tiger’s mouth and now fell into the wolf’s den.</p><p>“Do you have some disloyal thoughts towards Tang Xiu, old devil?” Will Art vigilantly questioned. He was ready to gamble.</p><p>“Hmph, loyalty?” Demonfreak geezer scoffed at the notion and said, “I admit Tang Xiu’s power is very strong and he can force me to bow my head. But he must come up with more valuable conditions if he wants to make me loyal to him. He gave me some benefits, that I admit. And that what makes me loyal to him.”</p><p>“So to say, you’re just loyal to your own interest. Then, how making a deal with me?” Will Art nodded.</p><p>“You’re a smart boy. It’s no wonder you’ve been recruiting people all over the world and secretly building your own force.” Demonfreak geezer praised with a thumbs up. “You know, you make me very curious, Will Art. How powerful is the force behind you?”</p><p>“That’s something many can’t imagine,” replied Will Art. “It’s just that I’m short on powerhouses like you.”</p><p>“That’s a given, I tell you. How come a strong expert like me would be willing to pledge allegiance to others, to begin with?” Demonfreak geezer replied in mockery. “Money is nothing but trash to people like me. Although privileges may entice us, it’s much better to make ourselves stronger. As for belles… Hehe… this old man has been living for a few centuries, what kind of beauty I haven’t seen? Do you think I’ll be attracted by beauties and whatnot?”</p><p>Will Art’s face turned a bit ugly. He fell into silence for a long time and then said in a deep voice, “I know that every man has their own needs and wants. You can ask what you want and I’ll get mine.”</p><p>Demonfreak geezer raised his brows and squinted. He scrutinized Will Art seriously and raised a thumbs up, praising. “You’re the most ambitious young man I’ve ever seen. You also got great luck that I can’t help but applaud for you. You’re correct. There are things I want in this world, and I can sell you those genetic agents if you can get them.”</p><p>“I want the formula,” replied Will Art in a deep voice.</p><p>“Do you think it’s possible?” The old devil sneered.</p><p>Will Art’s breath stagnated and he looked a bit helpless. In actuality, he was crystal clear that this old devil literally had a gold mine since in hands. Unless he could give him something even more valuable, he would never sell it to him.</p><p>“Alright, then state what you want.”</p><p>“I need medicinal herbs. Lots of precious ones,” said Demonfreak geezer. “If you have no idea what precious herbs are, you can send some people to China to find some Chinese medicine books. There are records of precious herbs on them. I’m sure you know some of them, for instance, Millennium Wild Ginseng, Millennium Snow Lotus, Empyrean Goldthread Pearl, Red Spider Lily, and many others.”</p><p>Will Art looked terrified and asked, “How do you know about the Empyrean Goldthread Pearl and Red Spider Lily?”</p><p>“Did you forget who my former companion was?” Demonfreak geezer sneered.</p><p>Will Art’s eyes shrunk and he looked shocked. He knew who this old devil’s former companion was—the notorious old devil in the dark world, Dao Master Poison—a very poisonous old devil and a Poison Master whose power made many not dare to provoke him.</p><p>Only, there was something that made Will Art very curious. Why did this Dao Master Poison not appear? It must be noted that this Demonfreak geezer had always been seen together with Dao Master Poison. Wherever the former appeared, the latter would also be there, and vice versa.</p><p><em>‘Did he turn to someone else? Could Dao Master be with someone else?’</em></p><p>Rolling his eyes as though he was able to read Will Art’s thoughts, Demonfreak geezer lightly said, “Heh, no need to mull over it. Dao Master Poison is already dead!”</p><p>“Say what?” Will Art utterly lost control and exclaimed, “You said Dao Master Poison is already dead? How can that be? He’s a poison master, who can kill him that easily?”</p><p>“I thought you were very smart. Hmph, never thought you don’t get it at all,” said Demonfreak geezer lightly with raised brows.</p><p>Will Art stared dumbly before a horrified look appeared on his face. He pondered for half a minute, then raised his head with difficulty and muttered, “You mean, the one who killed Dao Master Poison is… Mr. Tang?”</p><p>“Heh, who else is there beside him?” Demonfreak geezer sneered. “This guy… bah, forget it. Spare the talk about that bizarre person and let’s chat about our deal. I won’t kill or harm you if you’re willing to cooperate with me. I can even protect you a few times.”</p><p>“Deal!”</p><p>Will Art resolutely replied. He had no other choice left at this moment. He was likely to meet his end if he refused. But after complying, he felt that it wouldn’t bring any harm to him but benefits instead.</p><p>That benefit was the genetic agents.</p><p>He was indeed an ambitious young man. His House didn’t belong to nor was affiliated to any power. Their power may not on par with those top three powers in the world, but he believed that he could one day dominate those three colossi one day in the future through his own efforts.</p><p>“Let’s chat about the details then, Demonfreak geezer.”</p><p>He shot a cautious look at the old devil. As smart and ever-cautious as he was, only once he acted carelessly and underestimated others. That was his only mistake, yet it nearly made him lose his life in this sea.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
