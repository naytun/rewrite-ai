Some of the brothers who died in the battle were your relatives, and some others were our comrades in arms. You chose to join us, so you should all be ready and have the mentality to kill the enemies and avenge your brothers.</p><p>“It’s been 20 years, however, so I don’t know if you guys still remember the hatred of our brothers and whether you’re willing to avenge them. That’s why I’m giving you a chance to choose today. If you’re willing to do anything when we go against the world to avenge our brothers, then I welcome you to stay. But you can also choose to leave now should you have changed your mind. I’ll give you 2 million yuan so you can have a good life later.”</p><p>Up to this point, Tang Yunde’s expression turned extraordinarily serious.</p><p>“REVENGE!!”</p><p>“I’ve been waiting for so many years, just to wait for the days of revenge!”</p><p>“SOE company, House Dolan, you’re gonna pay for what you’ve done.”</p><p>“Blood for blood, teeth for teeth, and an eye for an eye.”</p><p>“KILL!!!”</p><p>The 80 people expressed their hatred with similarly intense determination and each of their own firm presence.</p><p>Tang Yunde stood straight while watching these brothers who had climbed up from the ground. He slowly raised his right hand and made a standard military salute.</p><p>DRAP…</p><p>They may no longer serve in the military, but they still saluted to express their respect for the bothers who had fallen in the battle, while at the same time, displaying their willingness to stay and fight side by side with the brothers who were still alive.</p><p>Tang Yunde nodded in silence. Then, he spoke again, “Now I ask you, are you willing to follow my son, Tang Xiu?”</p><p>“We are!”</p><p>A deafening and orderly reply came.</p><p>Tang Yunde nodded without a word and said, “I, Tang Yunde, guarantee that my son will treat you like his own brothers!”</p><p>“What my father just said is correct.” Tang Xiu confirmed in a deep voice. “He handed you over to me, so I’m going to lead you to charge through the enemy lines, killing everyone in House Dolan and completely obliterating the SOE company and the other companies under their control.”</p><p>Li Zaibiao paced forward a few steps and asked aloud, “I have two questions first.”</p><p>“Please ask,” replied Tang Xiu.</p><p>“First, what do we call you later?” asked the man.</p><p>“You can call me Boss,” answered Tang Xiu.</p><p>“Roger, Boss!!” shouted the 80 people in unison.</p><p>Li Zaibiao went on, “So, when are we going to start, Boss? We, brothers, have been waiting for so many years, and some have long been unable to wait much longer.”</p><p>“You don’t have to worry about waiting anymore since you’ve waited for so many years already.” Tang Xiu shook his head and continued, “Now is not yet the time to attack House Dolan, but I’ll lead you to charge forward later only after you’ve become stronger. I give you guys three months. If you can increase your strength tenfold in three months, only then are you qualified to be my men. Those who fail to do so will be given 2 million yuan as retirement pension and will be dismissed.”</p><p>Tang Yunde and Ni Penggang exchanged glances and tacitly agreed to depart along with Ni Jie. Tang Xiu, however, didn’t rush to leave since he had decided to incorporate these people. He didn’t want to waste time and directly taught them cultivation techniques. Although he only imparted them some introductory contents, it was able to make their cultivation reach the Golden Core Stage.</p><p>They were ecstatic.</p><p>Shortly after, he developed a training program. Then, he pulled out some pills from his interspatial ring and gave two to each person. With these two pills, these soldiers who already had Qi in their systems yet had no idea how to control the energy would quickly turn their True Qi into True Essence.</p><p>It was their foundation Tang Xiu valued the most. Such a foundation would make it easier for them to step into the ranks of cultivators and thus, could make it easier for them to cultivate.</p><p>All these 80 men wore horrified looks after seeing the training plan formulated by Tang Xiu, but then agreed while gritting their teeth after Tang Xiu explained and emphasized that only by following his training would they be able to rapidly promote their strength by tenfold in just three months.</p><p>As dusk came, Tang Xiu left. He left Tang 28 to accompany his father to have a drink with these old brothers of his at their reunion. Then, he quietly led Tang An to Liangang City.</p><p>The distance between Shanghai and Liangang was about 400-plus kilometers. It only took the two people a little more than two hours to arrive in Liangang by a high-speed train.</p><p>“Sect Master.”</p><p>As someone in charge of intelligence affairs, Jin Shi had already arrived in Liangang in advance after his injuries healed. He had long been waiting outside the train station.</p><p>“How is the situation there?” asked Tang Xiu while walking.</p><p>“A lot of strangers have been seen entering this port city,” said Jin Shi. “Their whereabouts are the same as those who already came previously. They are all drifters and vagabonds, and there are quite some outlandish people. But our men have already discovered their final meeting point.”</p><p>“Where is it?” asked Tang Xiu with raised brows.</p><p>“It’s at the Golden Coast, a private club,” answered Jin Shi.</p><p>“Is this club under Wen Feng, by chance?” asked Tang Xiu.</p><p>“No.” Jin Shi shook his head. “We got our operatives to investigate it. This club is not his, nor is it under the Riverhill Group. The Golden Coast is owned by someone called Zhu Heng. We’ve also investigated this man. The establishment is his only business, and he has no relationship with Wen Feng whatsoever. Additionally, rumors have it that Wen Feng and Zhu Heng had had a grudge and even got into a fight in public. Later, however, some people acted as intermediaries between them, so the matter was settled by leaving it unsettled.”</p><p>“Heh, that was camouflage to blind the public eyes.”</p><p>A contemptuous look flashed in Tang Xiu’s eyes. Those who had a relationship with Wen Feng came to the private club run by Zhu Heng, meaning that the man had a deep relationship with Wen Feng. It was likely they belonged to the same force, so the brutal clash was likely done to cover the truth from the public.</p><p>“So, how many are there gathered in the Golden Coast Club now?” Tang Xiu went on.</p><p>“We have no way to count the number specifically,” replied Jin Shi. “Their whereabouts are too secretive, and our intel operatives haven’t yet investigated many of them. Additionally, the Golden Coast’s security may seem lacking and looks normal from the outside, but the interior is extremely strictly guarded. You can see a guard stationed in every three steps, and a sentry post between five steps. There are at least nearly 300 security guards there, leaving no chance for anyone to sneak in.”</p><p>Tang Xiu’s expression turned serious. This level of security displayed a huge power behind it. Thus, this meeting was very important.</p><p>Just as Jin Shi took a seat in the car, his mobile phone buzzed. After fishing it out from his pocket and putting the call through, an intel operative’s voice reported. “Someone just entered the Golden Coast. His identity is Guo Tao, an influential and very wealthy businessman from Shaanxi.”</p><p>“Understood.”</p><p>Jin Shi hung up and looked at Tang Xiu. “Sect Master, just now…”</p><p>Tang Xiu raised his hand to interrupt him and lightly nodded. “I heard it. I’ve heard about this Guo Tao guy. He’s a real estate Boss with a net worth of 10 billion yuan. He’s also a martial artist and has a security company under his flag.”</p><p>“Sect Master, there are a lot of Big Bosses in the country with tens of billions net worth, yet do you actually know him? Don’t tell me, you…”</p><p>“Nah, no wild guesses, alright?” replied Tang Xiu lightly. “I heard about him from a friend. He mentioned him to me.”</p><p>Prior to this, Tang Xiu heard the man from Li Laoshan in their conversation way back then. Guo Tao was a wealthy businessman in Shaanxi Province, who was also a die-hard fan of martial arts and once had a spar with Li Laoshan and beat the latter badly. The most important thing was that Guo Tao was a very ruthless man with a beastly nature. He never cared about his opponent’s identity every time he sparred, and he had never and would never stop before he saw blood.</p><p>After giving it a thought, Tang Xiu took out his mobile phone and dialed Li Laoshan’s number.</p><p>“Hey, Brother Tang? What kind of wind blew for you to call me? Anyhow, I’ve been waiting for a while for you to invite me to drink, you know.” Li Laoshan’s hearty laughter then came from the phone.</p><p>“Well, I got tons of things at hand lately, Old Bro Li. Many of which are quite complicated, so I’ve not been able to find time to invite you to a drink.” Tang Xiu smiled. “Wait for me to deal with them, then I’ll find you to have some drinks.”</p><p>“That’s a deal!” Li Laoshan chuckled. “Anyway, you must have some issues since you’re calling me now, right? Just say it. I’ll definitely help you as long as this old brother of yours can do it.”</p><p>“Actually, I just wanna ask you about someone you once mentioned to me. I wanna hear how much you know about him,” said Tang Xiu smilingly.</p><p>“Who is it?” asked Li Laoshan in a strange tone.</p><p>“Well, I still remember you mentioned someone when we were chatting. It was about a wealthy businessman called Guo Tao of Shaanxi. How much do you know about him, Old Bro?” asked Tang Xiu.</p><p>Li Laoshan was silent for more than 10 seconds before he slowly said, “You’ll probably get the answer on the face if you ask others about him, Brother Tang. Nobody will give you the details, but I know some very secret things about him.”</p><p>Tang Xiu’s expression shifted and he inquired more. “Could you please tell me, Brother Li?”</p><p>“You know, Guo Tao is a successful rich businessman on the surface, but he’s also a strong martial artist. Even if he hasn’t yet reached the martial art grandmaster level, he isn’t far off either. Additionally, he also has a security company consisting of martial artists and experts he personally groomed.”</p><p>“The secret I’m gonna tell you, however, is not these. Guo Tao still has another identity. He has been abroad for many years and only returned to China a decade ago to set up his company. But he belongs to a very mysterious organization abroad, and I don’t know much about the details of this organization. I only know that this organization is great at investigation and gathering intel, and they also engaged in selling intelligence too.”</p><p><em>‘Information and intelligence? Is is the Darkwind organization?’</em></p><p>Coldness flashed in Tang Xiu’s eyes as he asked again, “How do you know about this secret, Brother Li?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
