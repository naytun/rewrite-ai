You’re just old trash. I don’t even want you as a son. Just grow up and man up, and get the hell out of my face before my partner cuts off your member and feeds it to the dogs.”</p><p>The middle-aged man was so furious that he was trembling. He grabbed the beer bottle on the table and swung it at Kuwako’s forehead fiercely.</p><p><em>Smash…</em></p><p>The bottle was smashed and shattered glass pieces, alcohol and blood were scattering about. It wasn’t Kuwako who got the beating but the middle-aged man. The culprit was Tang Xiu who now stood with a lit cigarette clamped in the corner of his lips while holding a half-broken bottle with a pale smile.</p><p>“Getting your hands on my woman? Are you tired of living or what?”</p><p>The middle-aged man squatted down and covered his bleeding head as Tang Xiu kicked his face and sent him flying a few meters backward, slamming on a table heavily. The other guests abruptly got up in fright instantly and two timid women let out panic screams, while the falling trays of fruit and beers from the tables created a more chaotic scene.</p><p>Kuwako smiled and acted like a delicate woman. She picked up a beer bottle from the table and slightly observed Tang Xiu’s appearance as she ran to the middle-aged man and smashed the bottle on his head. But she covered her eyes with another hand and let out a panic shriek while hitting him. After that…. acting like she was a scared rabbit, she ran back to Tang Xiu and hid behind him.</p><p>“Bastard!”</p><p>“Damn you!”</p><p>The sudden and unforeseen incident shocked the men at another table. They suddenly sobered up when Kuwako hid behind Tang Xiu and then stormed over at them.</p><p><em>BAM, BAM, BAM…</em></p><p>Xue Sha and Hei Xiong rushed out of the crowd nearby and sent out powerful punches at these men. At least, the onlookers around thought that they were just powerful and only used simple strikes. Yet, the four men were thrown off their feet and repeatedly screamed.</p><p>The scene turned more chaotic and drove many people to leave the rest area and ran away to the distance. It took only half a minute before the spot was emptied, save for Tang Xiu’s group.</p><p>“All of you, STOP!!!”</p><p>A cultured-looking middle-aged man with glasses in a black waistcoat and gold necklace on his neck rushed over along with four big men in black suites, whereas the waiters in the surroundings surrounded Tang Xiu’s group with glaring eyes.</p><p>Tang Xiu raised his hand to stop Xue Sha and Hei Xiong from beating the four big men. He smiled and looked at the middle-aged man dashing over, his eyes glancing at the signature card on his chest.</p><p>“What’s up? You wanna stick your nose?”</p><p>Without looking weak or salty, Tang Xiu spoke in fluent English since he didn’t know Japanese.</p><p>The refined middle-aged man narrowed his eyes and spoke two sentences in Japanese. Upon finding out that Tang Xiu seemed to not understand him, he immediately shifted to English and coldly said, “Who exactly are you, Mister? This nightclub is under my management and you dare cause trouble in the place under my jurisdiction?”</p><p>Tang Xiu lazily took out another cig as Kuwako suddenly came out behind him, gave him light quickly and carefully walked back to hide behind him. Tang Xiu then drew and blew the smoke twice and asked at a moderate pace, “What’s your name, Mister?”</p><p>“Oshima. You can call me that,” said the man indifferently.</p><p>“Well, Mr. Oshima, I hope you can truthfully reply to the serious question I’m about to ask you.” Tang Xiu slowly nodded.</p><p>“Pardon?” replied the man in a deep voice.</p><p>“What would you do if another man took a liking to your woman and harassed her before your eyes and treated you as if you didn’t exist?” asked Tang Xiu.</p><p>“I’d kill him!”</p><p>The refined man’s answer was exceptionally simple.</p><p>Tang Xiu immediately took it by face value and forced a smile. “Damn. It seems I’m still too soft! No wonder I’m still rather furious inside, it turns out I gotta kill this shit to vent my anger, huh.”</p><p>As his voice faded away, he dashed to the front of that middle-aged man, grabbed his hair, and slammed his face on the table’s corner. The man’s struggling body softened and his breath gradually faded away along with the brain stuff and blood coming out of his head.</p><p>Tang Xiu clapped and happily said, “Thanks a bunch for your advice, Mr. Oshima. It turns out that I can only calm down after killing him. Anyhow, you just asked me why I made trouble in the nightclub under your management, so I’ll answer it now. This fella I just killed sexually harassed my woman before my eyes. Do you think my explanation is enough for you?”</p><p>With a chill running down his back and incredulity painting his face, Oshima could only stare at the middle-aged man who had gradually lost his breath. His hands were also stained with murder and he did the deed quite often. Yet, Tang Xiu’s action was ruthless and cold-blooded, even in his eyes.</p><p>It was because he had never seen anyone who could still speak so calmly with him with such a happy smile after murdering someone. It was like what he just killed was not a human but rather an ant, or a fry.</p><p>Secretly drawing a deep breath, Oshima stared at Tang Xiu and said in a heavy voice, “Care to share me the name, Mister? Don’t you know that killing is against the law?”</p><p>Tang Xiu shrugged it off and said, “You ask whether I know that murder is against the law? Anyhow, I forgot to tell you that I’m not a Japanese. I don’t care how strict the law in your country is, but as long as I can smoothly leave Japan, it’s impossible for your country to convict me no matter how powerful it is.”</p><p>Oshima’s glaring gaze swept away to Xue Sha and Hei Xiong and finally landed on Tang Xiu’s face again. He paced two steps backward, waved and shouted, “Catch them!”</p><p>Tang Xiu shook his head secretly and helplessly said, “No longer shitty nonsense to talk about since you decided to pick us on, huh? Hey, you both take them on and kill these hoodlums who want to bully me.”</p><p>Xue Sha and Hei Xiong drew the Mitsubishi army knives from their waists at the same time. Staring daggers at the four storming sturdy men and all the attendants, they quickly moved and slashed their daggers, causing blood to splatter everywhere. Apart from those four black-suited big guys, a total of 16 attendants were all heavily injured by the duo in just half a minute, causing them to lose their ability to fight and slump on the floor.</p><p>Tang Xiu watched the disbelief on Oshima’s face with a beaming face. He gave him the middle finger and said, “Aren’t your men rather disappointing? These two men of mine were once the champions of the world-class underground fighting before. You can take out tens of those weak shrimps and dogs and they won’t still be enough to take them on. Know your place! And get the fuck out after kowtowing to me, else you can expect to have your soul taken.”</p><p>Eyes blurred with a haze, Oshima quickly grabbed the intercom on his waist, pressed a button and shouted aloud, “Someone is causing trouble in my site and tens of our brothers have all been beaten. Hurry up and send support!”</p><p>“Copy that.” A curt reply was heard from the walkie-talkie.</p><p>Tang Xiu’s brows raised up. He grabbed Kuwako’s hand and turned back to sit on the sofa, lifting one leg atop the other. With a cig clamped on the corner of his mouth, he leisurely pulled Kuwako to his arms and patted her shoulder. Then, he looked at Oshima and said in contempt, “You just called someone, right? Hehe… there’s no way such a coward like you can summon more powerful men. But then again, I can’t just turn over the boat in the gutter since this is your turf, can I? Just bring it on! Call anyone you like and let’s have some games and see who can summon more people and whose fist is harder!”</p><p>Fury glittered in Oshima’s eyes, but he quickly suppressed it forcefully. After pondering for a moment, he took out a cell phone from his pocket and dialed a number fast. After his call was connected, he respectfully said, “Boss, some experts just made a scene in our site. Also, this guy just ordered his men to catch up, so I’m afraid we’ll have more people coming over.”</p><p>“You can’t deal with it yourself?”</p><p>This Boss was obviously a bit angry given his bad tone.</p><p>A restless and anxious look flitted across Oshima’s face as he said in a low voice, “The tens of Brothers who were watching over the site and the four who are always with me got done in by them. That fella himself said that those two experts around him were once the champions of the world-class underground fighting.”</p><p>“Hang in there.”</p><p>The man hung up.</p><p>A few minutes later, all the guests in the nightclub left, while tens of aggressive-looking tattooed big men flooding in with machetes or sticks in their hands. The bald man, who seemed to be their leader, stared at Tang Xiu’s group of four with contempt and spoke to Oshima, “I already told you that your men are trash, didn’t I? Bring them over to the training camp later and I’ll drill them well for you.”</p><p>“You definitely can have them for the drills after this fiasco today, Ozawa,” said Oshima with a wry smile. “But shall we deal with them now? We’re going to have some unforeseen shits if the bunch this fella just called arrives here, no?”</p><p>The bald man called Ozawa stroked his shiny bald head and looked slightly surprised. “They also summoned their men? Who the hell gave them balls to take the Inari Society as an enemy?”</p><p>Kuwako translated their conversation to Tang Xiu as he gently pushed her away to flick the cigarette butt. The butt directly hit Ozawa’s bald head and Tang Xiu raised his head after seeing his furious look. “Now, now. Let’s no rush. Is your Inari Society some kind of powerful bunch or something? Why haven’t I heard of you before?”</p><p>Ozawa frowned and looked at the Oshima. “What the hell is this bastard saying?”</p><p>Oshima translated Tang Xiu’s words and finally said, “He’s too damn arrogant and insolent, Ozawa. Let’s just beat them up now and give him a tough lesson.”</p><p>Ozawa nodded and shouted aloud, “All of you, unleash everything you got and cripple these bastards! Leave the woman, I’ll fuck her before his eyes!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
