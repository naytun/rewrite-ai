Even Xue Yu, who had broken through to the Spirit Formation Stage, was still inferior to him. But the strongest one behind them was Tang An. Not only was she an expert at the late-stage of Golden Core, but she also mastered a secret art on spatial law and some of the law of time.</p><p>In terms of magical spells, there was perhaps not many people as well versed at it in Tang Sect, but Tang An was definitely one. Not only did she like to study various classics on arrays, but she was also very keen on studying magic spells and had an achievement on some of them.</p><p>The flames that emerged in the sea of fire emitted a faint blue luster. Cultivators from the Immortal World would definitely recognize that fire as the True Flame in the legends.</p><p>Wang Sheng was shaken, his eyes nearly jumping out. Tang An’s power was already outrageous, yet he never expected her to be an ability user—a fire bender.</p><p>“What the heck is this flame?!”</p><p>He instantly retreated backward due to his keen sense warning him that this was absolutely not an ordinary flame. The flame he had unleashed was even actually forced to retreat when the blue flame appeared.</p><p>Tang An’s figure vanished once again, but her immortal sword was still hovering in the air, blocking off every possible route to escape for Wang Sheng.</p><p>“SCRAM!!!”</p><p>Wang Sheng furiously bellowed after evading a strike of the immortal sword when suddenly, he felt his body go stiff and a chilling sensation hit his neck. It turned out to be a dagger that suddenly appeared out of the blue and was placed on his neck.</p><p>“You come with me.”</p><p>Tang An’s chilling voice passed to Wang Sheng’s ear as her figure appeared at the man’s side.</p><p>****</p><p>The killings in the Golden Coast club were progressing quickly. All the members of the Darkwind organization who tried to resist were all killed ruthlessly, whereas tens of them who chose not to were stunned and discarded before the tens of experts from the Special Abilities Bureau brought them to the square to be apprehended.</p><p>When Tang Xiu arrived at the square, he could clearly see the beaming smile on Duanmu Lin’s face.</p><p>“Senior Duanmu!” shouted Tang Xiu with a smile.</p><p>The man happily nodded and said, “I never thought the operation would go this well, Tang Xiu. You just literally made them collapse from the inside and then easily destroyed them. These two former members of the Darkwind are not bad. They deserve to be rewarded.”</p><p>Tang Xiu calmly glanced at Guo Tao and Wen Feng and cooly said, “It’s as you say, Senior Duanmu. They did great merit this time, so I’m going to reward them later.”</p><p>Nodding slightly in response, Duanmu Lin glanced around and his beaming smile slowly disappeared. He even furrowed his brows and asked, “Have you found any trace on Wang Sheng?”</p><p>Zhu Long shook his head. “We got nothing. It’s like he just vanished. But he should still be in the clubhouse since a few people saw him just 10 minutes ago.”</p><p>“Keep searching for him! I don’t care if you turn everything upside down, but you still must find him!” Duanmu Lin ordered in a heavy voice.</p><p>Tang Xiu’s expression shifted and he shook his head. “I don’t think it’s necessary to find him, though.”</p><p>“What do you mean?” Duanmu Lin was confused.</p><p>Right after he asked, two figures suddenly appeared in front of him. Donned in black night suit and a bronze mask was Tang An, whereas the one who looked distressed and seriously injured was Wang Sheng.</p><p>“This is…”</p><p>Duanmu Lin looked ecstatic after seeing Wang Sheng’s face. He truly admired Tang Xiu wholeheartedly. This young man was not only powerful, he even had quite a subordinate with amazing skills under him. He previously thought that Wang Sheng had escaped, but it turned out that Tang Xiu’s subordinate had seized him already.</p><p>With eyes that seemed able to perceive people’s minds, Tang Xiu swept over Duanmu Lin’s face before he instantly appeared in front of Wang Sheng. He exerted a great deal of his energy to hit tens of vital points around the man’s body and completely sealed them. Afterward, he paced two steps backward and spoke with a faint smile. “You’re the Chief Intel Operative of the Darkwind branch in China, yes?”</p><p>Wang Sheng just stared at Tang Xiu in response and stayed silent for several seconds. Then, he slowly said, “You should be able to see the internal condition of my body. Most of my life force has gone, and I can only last for a few minutes more. I’m afraid you won’t have more chances if you don’t get the answer you want.”</p><p>“Not really.” Tang Xiu shook his head and smiled. “It may work if you say that to others, but it’s useless to me. You’re the Head of the Darkwind branch in China, Wang Sheng. You should know my existence, and the most detailed information about me must have been sent to your desk once, right?”</p><p>Eyes full of surprise, Wang Sheng nodded. “You’re right. I did read a lot of information about you.”</p><p>“Then, did you forget my identity and about Chinese medicine?” Tang Xiu probed smilingly.</p><p>Expression slightly changing, a bad feeling filled Wang Sheng’s heart and he asked in a heavy voice, “What do you mean?”</p><p>“Heh, why bother asking since you have guessed it already?” Tang Xiu sneered. “My subordinate may have gotten you severely injured, but she got a clear order from me, so she’d never kill you. If anything, your life force is leaking out fast because you’re trying to commit suicide when she was not aware of it, to begin with. But I’m a Chinese medicine practitioner. As long as I don’t permit you to die, you won’t die even if you try your best to kill yourself.”</p><p>“Goddammit!”</p><p>Wang Sheng’s expression twisted. He was indeed trying to commit suicide by using a special mean to destroy his vitality. Tang Xiu’s remarks, however, gave him deep dread since he never feared death. Being alive was much more dreadful to him.</p><p>Tang Xiu squinted and went on to deliver his mental attack to wreck Wang Sheng once again. “Further, you should know some about my identities, but you don’t know a lot more about me. I don’t think you know about my other identity as a cultivator, no? Let me tell you frankly. That Elder Wei from your organization has been slain by me. He was nothing but a weak Golden Core Stage, yet he dared to be arrogant before me. He deserved death.”</p><p>“THAT’S IMPOSSIBLE!!!” roared Wang Sheng. Dread and horror were evident on his face.</p><p>“Impossible, huh? Hahaha…” Tang Xiu sneered. “Do you think ants like you guys can figure out my means if any? There’s something else I can tell you. As a cultivator, I still have many more means unimaginable to you. Such as technique to scrutinize your soul—the Soul Scouring Art. I can search your memory five minutes after you died and get the answer I wanna know from your mind.”</p><p><em>Soul Scouring Art?!!</em></p><p><em>Isn’t that the extremely sinister technique mentioned in the legends? A secret art that only devils can master? Oh, GOD! If he’s telling the truth, I’m afraid I can’t keep any secret of the organization even if I completely die now. I know too much. Once my memory is checked by him, it will definitely cause great harm to the entire organization!</em></p><p>“KILL ME NOW!!!”</p><p>Wang Sheng suddenly looked up and yelled at the night sky.</p><p>Tang Xiu’s expression changed as he noticed that Tang An also vanished instantly. He instantly unleashed the divine sword from his body. It then formed a sword image that covered the sky and streaked upward turbulently. At that moment, a ghostly figure clad in a black night coat with a golden mask and a shovel on his back suddenly appeared in the midst of layers of swords images.</p><p><em>ROAR…</em></p><p>The chilling and turbulent energy suddenly blew toward the people in the surroundings. Even those who were comparable to the Foundation Establishment Stage experts were forced back and felt suffocated as they constantly retreated backward.</p><p>The mysterious thin man with the golden mask looked as though a solitary boat in the roaring, violent sea. He flew frantically in the midst of sword tides as he shed his blood. A sharp flying knife then shot toward Tang Xiu’s chest, causing the clothes on Tang Xiu’s chest to explode. Yet, the flying knife only left a faint mark on it and was unable to pierce the skin.</p><p>“Interesting!”</p><p>Tang Xiu instantly streaked up and closely trailed the mysterious man. Had he not reacted fast enough a moment ago, that flying knife would’ve pierced Wang Sheng’s head, instead of hitting his chest.</p><p>That was an act to silence the witness! This kind of ruthlessness was the style of the Darkwind organization in handling their affairs. Yet, the other party’s forbearance evoked Tang Xiu’s admiration regardless. The man was able to forbear until the end, and it was very likely that he had heard what he just said to Wang Sheng.</p><p>“Impossible!”</p><p>The mysterious man’s voice was very hoarse as he exclaimed out in alarm. He was crystal clear about his own power, which was comparable to the Golden Core Stage cultivators. He exerted all his strength to shoot that flying knife, yet it only left a shallow mark on Tang Xiu’s body, not even able to pierce his skin. This was beyond his imagination.</p><p>The divine sword in Tang Xiu’s hand bolted lightning-fast toward the mysterious man, gifting him a serious bleeding injury several centimeters long. Afterward, Tang Xiu sneered at him. “I didn’t lie when I said that I’m a cultivator, yet my main practice is not cultivating True Essence energy but the Demon God’s physique refinement. You can say that I’m a body cultivator. You’ll never inflict any injuries on me unless you’ve reached the late-stage of Golden Core and used a divine armament to injure me.”</p><p><em>Puff…</em></p><p>Just as his voice faded away and right as a look of fear was cast on the man’s face, the divine sword swept away once again and directly slashed his body.</p><p>Wang Sheng wore a pained look upon witnessing the scene in mid-air. He knew very well about some special arrangements in the Darkwind organization. Every director assigned to a country was responsible for the entire intelligence operations, yet someone would also be arranged as a Finisher—or rather… a terminator.</p><p>However, his father was one of the Darkwind’s founders—a powerful man who held the power and rights to speak as one of the top three in the organization. Before he was sent to China, his father promised him that there would be no Finisher arranged for him. The old man said that he trusted him and that he would never betray him.</p><p><em>It turns out that Father never have, has, or will trust anyone. Not even his own son.</em></p><p>The heartbreaking pain engulfed him. His father was a man he respected and admired the most in this world—someone he would never betray. Prior to this, he had even made up his mind to commit suicide to take the secret of the Darkwind organization to his grave… all for his father.</p><p>And yet, he found himself… wrong.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
