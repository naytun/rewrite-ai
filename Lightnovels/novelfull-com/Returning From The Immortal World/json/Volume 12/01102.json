Ever since he advanced to the Stars Heavenly Essence level, he was able to easily etch various contents into the target’s mind, all the while feeling lazy to take out the Beast Ruling Art manual.</p><p><em>‘What strength!’</em></p><p>Demonfreak geezer wanted to dodge out of instinct, but Tang Xiu’s speed was too fast and his strength was too strong. He wasn’t able to move despite going all out to do so. While his mind was full of thoughts that Tang Xiu would harm him, the Beast Controlling Art suddenly appeared in his mind.</p><p>“This is…?”</p><p>He was shocked at the extreme. Although he was shocked by Tang Xiu’s strength, the mysterious method Tang Xiu just displayed shocked him more. He heard that only some very powerful figures could do such a direct transmission technique. Moreover, the art he just obtained was completely able to solve his predicament when the Cadaveric Beast went against him when it became much stronger.</p><p>Quickly after Tang Xiu imparted Demonfreak geezer the Beast Controlling Art, he released the old man and went back a few meters away, saying lightly, “Keep my words in mind. All foreign objects are nothing but external objects, for the one you can truly rely on is nothing but your own strength. Alright, feel free to find yourself a guest room to take that Sanguine Pill!”</p><p>Awe was evident on Demonfreak geezer’s face as he looked at Tang Xiu. He respectfully complied and let out a sigh of relief as he took the Cadaveric Beast away quickly. He casually found a room and then took the Sanguine Pill, sitting cross-legged and starting to cultivate.</p><p>Two days later.</p><p>Tom Reggie had already put the entire underground forces in Saipan under his control. He killed a lot of people during these days, but it was more like he was using a carrot and stick method to become the overlord of Saipan’s underground forces. During this period, some practitioners from other forces wanted to eliminate him. Finally, Tang Xiu acted and, after killing some groups of malicious people, the situation in Saipan finally calmed down.</p><p><em>Whoosh…</em></p><p>Tang Guang silently appeared before Tang Xiu with an exciting look. After saluting, he respectfully said, “I’ve advanced to the late-stage of Golden Core and perhaps can break through to the Nascent Soul soon, Grand Master!”</p><p>“Has the resentment contained in the Sanguine Pill caused too much impact to you?” Tang Xiu nodded and smiled.</p><p>“No,” replied Tang Guang smilingly.</p><p>Tang Xiu nodded. “You’ve been tempered since childhood and is accustomed to matters of life and death in battle, so your mind has been honed. <em>Hmm?</em> Tang An, you’ve also broken through to the late-stage of Golden Core?”</p><p>A graceful figure appeared out of the blue next to Tang Guang. Wearing a black robe, the bronze-masked Tang An said, “I’ve advanced to the late-stage of Golden Core, Grand Master.”</p><p>“It seems like you siblings will be the first two to break through to the Nascent Soul in our Tang Sect. Keep up the hard work since I hope that you can get stronger and stronger. At least, you won’t fall behind me too far.”</p><p>The sibling exchanged glances and nodded firmly in response.</p><p>Quickly after, Mo Awu and Hao Lei appeared in front of Tang Xiu. Both looked similarly excited and reported after saluting, “We just broke through to the late-stage of Golden Core, Sovereign. But our new realm isn’t very solid yet.”</p><p>“That’s great already,” Tang Xiu smilingly said. “Keep diligent in cultivation for the following days, so you can quickly stabilize your realm completely.”</p><p>“Understood!” The two people nodded.</p><p>Immediately after, Mo Awu turned to look at Tang Guang and grinningly said, “Well, now my cultivation has caught up with you, maybe it won’t take long before I surpass you.”</p><p>Tang Guang let out a contemptuous smile in response. He stretched out two fingers and said, “You know, gimme 20 days and I can break through the Nascent Soul Stage. How long do you think you need till you get the confidence to advance to the Nascent Soul, huh?”</p><p>“Ugh…” Mo Awu gaped and immediately looked awkward. It was completely due to the Sanguine Pill’s effect that he could break through to the late-stage of Golden Core. What’s more, he hadn’t even stabilized his new realm, let alone bragging about rushing to the Nascent Soul Stage.</p><p>Furthermore, he was perfectly aware of one thing: once Tang Guang advanced to the Nascent Soul Stage, his strength would increase by many folds. This guy would only need a flick of a finger to fend off his all-out strength.</p><p>“Anyways, what about Kuwako and Demonfreak? Are they not finished yet?” asked Tang Xiu smilingly.</p><p>The four shook their heads at the same time.</p><p>“Kuwako advanced to the Golden Core Stage very quickly, but it was all thanks to her obtaining many heavenly and earthly materials and treasures in Japan, which she exchanged with many pills. Her body still contains a lot of unabsorbed efficacies. It’s likely she cannot refine the energy of Sanguine Pill in a short time. It seems like I need to give her special training.”</p><p>“Can we also participate in this special training, Sect Master?” asked Mo Awu hurriedly.</p><p>Special training! Particularly one arranged by Tang Xiu. It’d make their strength advance by leaps and bound every time they finished it. Although the training was unusually painful, it was greatly beneficial for them, so Mo Awu couldn’t help but ask about it.</p><p>“Nah, you don’t need special training, Awu.” Tang Xiu shook his head and smiled. “You just need to work hard and practice step by step. Besides, the training I’m about to give Kuwako won’t have much effect on you. Ah, Demonfreak geezer just finished. Well, he hasn’t broken through to the Nascent Soul Stage, but he kinda reached the Perfected Golden Core Stage, just like Tang Guang and Tang An.”</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>Just as Tang Xiu’s voice faded away, the said person’s figure appeared in front of everyone. A pleasantly surprised look on his face, he bowed to Tang Xiu and excitedly said, “I just advanced to the late-stage of Golden Core, Boss. I originally prepared a lot of treasures and was waiting for Dao Master Poison so he could help me advance to the late-stage of Golden Core. But now it seems I don’t need him at all.”</p><p>“Well, you won’t need him anymore since he’s already gone from this world, though.” Tang Xiu smiled. “If anything, cultivators at the late-stage of Golden Core are still like ants to me, Demonfreak. Only after you’ve advanced to the Nascent Soul Stage in the future will you understand how big the chasm is between these two stages.”</p><p><em>‘The Nascent Soul Stage?!’</em></p><p>Demonfreak geezer gaped and immediately let out a hollow smile. “I’m already satisfied with breaking through to the late-stage of Golden Core, Boss. I don’t think I can ever reach the Nascent Soul Stage in my life.”</p><p>“Why?” Tang Xiu knitted his brows.</p><p>“It’s because of my cultivation art,” replied Demonfreak helplessly. “I obtained it from a loose cultivator, and the highest stage of this cultivation art is only up to the late-stage of Golden Core. That’s why I don’t have the cultivation art to progress to the next stages.”</p><p>“You chose to submit to me and I’m not afraid of your betrayal, so I’m going to teach you a cultivation technique which will propel you to the Great Ascension Stage at the very least,” said Tang Xiu after he quickly caught his meaning. “I’ll even impart you the cultivation art for the next stages beyond the Great Ascension Stage if your performance is great.”</p><p>A shocked look appeared on Demonfreak’s face. Just as he was about to speak, Tang Xiu’s hand was pressed on his forehead again and contents of a cultivation art instantly appeared in his mind. The geezer slightly shivered and looked wild with joy. His gratefulness nearly made him kowtow to Tang Xiu.</p><p>This was a cultivation technique!</p><p>Further, it allowed one to cultivate up to the Great Ascension Stage. Such cultivation art was absolutely more valuable than 100 gold mountains in today’s times.</p><p>“This Demonfreak geezer will absolutely be loyal and devoted to you from now on, Boss!” Demonfreak geezer cupped his fists and solemnly vowed after receiving the cultivation technique.</p><p>“No need to show loyalty with words before me, prove it with your actions in the future,” said Tang Xiu smilingly.</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>He had been feeling reluctant and unwilling, racking his brain countless times on how to escape from Tang Xiu’s control. But now he secretly thought that what Kuwako had said made sense. Following Tang Xiu was literally a chance to get a huge opportunity.</p><p>Two hours later, Kuwako hurriedly appeared in front of Tang Xiu with an enthusiastic face. When she saw everyone else had finished their cultivation and reported faster than her, the joy in her heart vanished instantly, and then she respectfully said, “I’ve broken through to the mid-stage of Golden Core, Sect Master. And I’m sure I can quickly advance to the late-stage soon.”</p><p>“No. You’re progressing too fast in your cultivation. This will lead to a shaky foundation.” Tang Xiu shook his head. “I’ll arrange a special training program for you after we’re done with this matter and go back. After you’ve stabilized your new realm completely and you’ve absorbed the residual pills’ efficacy in your system, as well as the one from the Sanguine Pill, you can then advance to the late-stage of Golden Core.”</p><p>“Sovereign, you said I have a lot of residual pills’ efficacy in my system, and even the Sanguine Pill’s energy hasn’t been fully absorbed?” questioned Kuwako in doubt.</p><p>Instead of directly answering her question, Tang Xiu asked, “You often feel your body turn warm and even a sudden heat flow from a certain part of your body when you’re practicing, don’t you? Also, the sensation as if your True Essence is getting stronger by a level, no?”</p><p>“Yeah, I often encounter such a case.” Kuwako nodded.</p><p>“That’s due to the dormant medicinal efficacy in your system,” explained Tang Xiu. “You’ve taken too many heavenly and earthly treasures prior to this. Your system was unable to fully refine and absorb them all, given your cultivation level at the time. After a long time, it has been accumulating and remained in your system.”</p><p>Kuwako instantly caught the gist and nodded. “I see, Kuwako will follow your arrangement, Sect Master.”</p><p>Tang Xiu turned to Demonfreak geezer and said, “It’s time to contact Angelo Dolan. Find where they are. We’ll eliminate them swiftly. These bastards have injured my men, they must pay a painful price for that!”</p><p>“Understood!” Demonfreak geezer complied.</p><p>The old man could feel how protective was Tang Xiu towards his underlings from his words. Suddenly, he felt that pledging his allegiance to him was truly a good decision. Once he had proven his loyalty and was thoroughly recognized by him, it was likely that he’d also help him to avenge his enemy once he got injured by any outsiders.</p><p>In the next two days, Tang Xiu secretly met Song Guanghui. After discussing some issues with him, he took everyone to board the liner to rush toward the Pacific Ocean. Although Tom Reggie had just become the overlord of Saipan’s underground forces, Tang Xiu didn’t intend to leave him alone in Saipan and let him pick one capable and loyal man to take care of Saipan on his behalf. Afterward, he used special means to make Tom Reggie ingest the Sanguine Pill and helped him to embark on the cultivation path.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
