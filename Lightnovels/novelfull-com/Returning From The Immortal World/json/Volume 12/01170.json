They both didn’t fully use their strength and controlled their bodies to fly out backward after the clash.</p><p>“Umm?!”</p><p>Ozawa stopped pursuing Tang Xiu and Kuwako and shot a look at them with a surprised face. He could tell these two men who intercepted him were cultivators. It was certain, although their strength seemed weak.</p><p>Hei Xiong and Xue Sha themselves quickly bounced up after falling on the floor and looked at Ozawa Manzo with fearful faces. They then hastily ran towards Tang Xiu. After catching up, Xue Sha deliberately shouted, “Young Master, that rogue is too powerful. We gotta run quickly…”</p><p>Ozawa’s figure flickered as he moved lightning-fast to chase them. In that instant, Xue Sha and Hei Xiong quickly grabbed Tang Xiu and Kuwako’s arms and rushed towards the window nearby. The moment after, the glass hit by their bodies shattered and they directly jumped out of the building.</p><p>“Damn bastards!”</p><p>Ozawa was about to jump and pursue them instinctively, but he wanted to hide his identity as a cultivator. He was hardly able to halt his pace right as he stopped next to the window. He looked down at the four who crashed down below as they drilled into the car at a very fast speed and drove away.</p><p>“Escaping fast, huh? No matter how fast you are, you can never escape from a cultivator. The Inada Society and Daikura Sakuragi, heh? This bastard and his dojo dare to find me trouble. You’re all just tired of living.”</p><p>Unwilling to stay any longer, Ozawa felt there was something fishy about today’s incident given the appearance of these cultivators. He quickly rushed to the Inada Society at once to figure out the identity of that brat. And then… gave him another tough lesson!</p><p>“Honey, wait for me!”</p><p>The seductive woman rushed out from the inside with her handbag and said in dismay and fright, “You’re really powerful and amazing, dear. Just like a superman. Ah, you haven’t bought that diamond ring and a platinum necklace for me! C-can… I take them now?”</p><p>“SCRAM!”</p><p>Baffled to find many enemies coming for no reason had already made Ozawa frustrated and angry. Now that he heard the seductive woman speak like that, he slapped her hard and sent her flying backward. He immediately pulled her hand and quickly left in large strides.</p><p>Half an hour later, at the gate of the Inada Society. Four security guards were on duty when they saw a car approaching fast from a distance. Immediately after, one of them quickly came out.</p><p><em>Creaaaaak…</em></p><p>The brakes sounded and the car’s door was pushed open as Tang Xiu got off with Kuwako’s support. He ignored the four security guards and entered through the front door under the protection of Xue Sha and Hei Xiong, who now looked wretched.</p><p>“Get the hell out of your hole, Daikura! I spent tons of money on you when I just came to Japan. I lost hundreds of millions USD more and I was still fine. But you bastard lied to me… you owe a damn explanation!”</p><p>On the second floor of the attic, in the quaint study, the sullen and grim-looking Daikura Sakuragi had just returned from the Floating Yacht casino and was smashing everything in the study and venting his anger to his men. Certainly, the curses aimed at him from the outside made him furious.</p><p>“Which asshole came to make trouble in my Inada Society, huh?”</p><p>Daikura Sakuragi rushed out of the study and dashed downstairs to the entrance. His angry roar had spread out, but his angry face was instantly frozen upon seeing the bloodstained Tang Xiu. He even saw that his bodyguards, Xue Sha and Hei Xiong, also had blood on their lips.</p><p><em>What’s going on?</em></p><p><em>Didn’t I assign 100 bodyguards to protect this fella? What about them? What has this surnamed Tang run into that made him look so miserable now?</em></p><p>Tang Xiu dashed to Daikura’s front with a furious face. He broke away from Kuwako’s support and grabbed the Daikura’s front clothes, shouting aloud, “You’re a damn bastard. Your family is all bastards! You dare to deceive me, Daikura Sakuragi! Did you forget I’ve given you tons of money?!!”</p><p>Daikura deeply furrowed his brows and looked at the furious Tang Xiu before he immediately moved his hands and quickly said, “Is there any misunderstanding here, Mr. Tang? I spoke like that just now, but I didn’t know it was you. I thought it was someone wanting to make trouble in my place, so I said something I shouldn’t. But… what do you mean by I’m deceiving you? Where and when did I lie to you?”</p><p>“You didn’t deceive me you say? F**k! You really got the balls!” Tang Xiu yelled furiously. “This young master gave you tons of money to hire 100 bodyguards from you. ONE. F*****G. HUNDRED! What did you tell me then? Your men are experts and masters, literally an elite force. And now? Just one man is enough to make all those shits scared shitless and crying out loud. Do you even know… how this young master nearly died in the hands of that bastard?!”</p><p>Just a man beat up 100 people?</p><p>Disbelief on his face, Daikura Sakuragi retorted loudly. “Did you lose your mind or something, Mr. Tang? Who could possibly have such great abilities to fight 100 people alone? More so well-trained experts like my men?”</p><p>Tang Xiu pointed to Daikura Sakuragi and roared as his finger was about to point to his nose. “Experts? What bull! What I saw was a bunch of idiots and sissies! Do you see my appearance now? I was beaten by that man! Do you see my men? They are all powerful experts. Cultivators! I would have been killed if they didn’t protect me. What about your men, huh? I don’t know how many of them died…”</p><p>“What?!”</p><p>Daikura’s eyes shrunk with killing intent overflowing from them.</p><p><em>My men are gone? They were all killed?</em></p><p>Daikura blocked Tang Xiu’s hand and inquisitively asked, “Who the hell is that man?”</p><p>Kuwako pulled Tang Xiu’s sleeves and interjected with a similarly indignant face. “He said his name is Ozawa Manzo.”</p><p>“Ozawa Manzo?”</p><p>Clenching his fists tightly, a chilling light flashed in Daikura Sakuragi’s eyes. The 100 bodyguards he sent to Tang Xiu were all experts he had trained himself and were also the men he trusted. Yet, they had all been killed. This Ozawa Manzo must die!</p><p>“Where is this bastard now? I’ll kill him!”</p><p>Grieving with fury, Daikura roared loudly.</p><p>He had lost a total of 200 million dollars today, and now his men were killed by someone. It was all more than enough to make him furious to the extreme. The most important issue was the client who hired the bodyguards was here and the news of the incidents that happened to these 100 bodyguards should have spread out by now. The aftermath? At the end of the day, his men not only failed to protect their client but even got beaten so badly. It was absolutely a great shame to his Inada Society.</p><p>If today’s incident were to spread out further, how would he run his business in the future? Who among those who had been training under him would want to work as bodyguards for hire anymore later?</p><p>This… was literally cutting off his source of income!</p><p>Hei Xiong paced forward and looked at him, saying aloud, “Mr. Sakuragi, never once has our Young Master ever had such a big blow, hence why he’s so furious now. I hope you are not angry with him. However, the fact is there. The bodyguards we hired from you have been killed or injured. Meaning your men here are trash. But I advise you not to get too headstrong and keep your head cool as that man is a very formidable cultivator. You may only be killed ruthlessly even if you fight him in person.”</p><p>“SHUT YOUR CRAP!!!” Daikura Sakuragi yelled angrily, “That Ozawa is a cultivator, do you think I’m not one? I’ve been staying low-key all these years and rarely have I provoked others. Little did I expect that damn Ozawa dares to do so to me. Tell me, where the hell is that asshole now? I’m gonna kill him for sure!”</p><p>About seven-plus seconds later, the four bodyguards outside the entrance were sent flying backward and slammed into the entrance gate, coughing up blood and falling unconscious as their bodies slammed on the ground. Shortly after, a figure with a huge aura appeared at the door.</p><p>Eyes full of killing intent, Ozawa stared daggers at Daikura and furiously roared, “We used to know each other, Daikura Sakuragi. We may not be friends, but we’re not enemies either. Yet you bastard wants to kill me? Come and bring it on! I’ll see what abilities you actually have!”</p><p>After seeing clearly that the man was Ozawa Manzo, Daikura Sakuragi stormed forward with a roar. He instantly pulled out the dagger and delivered swift and fierce strikes at Ozawa.</p><p>“DIE!”</p><p>Ozawa dashed forward to clash with him without fear and blasted out with all his strength instantly.</p><p>The frantic fight was so intense and bloody. Both men engaged in a crazy fight for a full 2 minutes, resulting in both of them being dyed red by their blood, arousing their killing intent even further. Daikura and Ozawa were similar in strength, but the latter made two mistakes in the fight, resulting in much more severe injuries than the former.</p><p>“Boundless Ocean of Buddha!”</p><p>“Boundless Ocean of Buddha!”</p><p>Both men fiercely shouted at the same time, nearly staking out everything by risking their lives as they rushed to clash yet again with each unleashing their respective ace killing move. The final clash was but an instant, but each sent the other flying backward with a grievous injury.</p><p>Tang Xiu just stood with folded arms nearby watching them fight. When he saw both men use the same killing move, it was finally confirmed that they were from the Joyous Palace. He walked towards them with a smiling face, clapping and saying, “Have you both played enough?”</p><p>Daikura and Ozawa, who were sent flying backward, wore disbelieving expressions at the same time after hearing the name of the move each just unleashed.</p><p>It was the same? What did that mean?</p><p>That explained that they were members of the Joyous Palace and very likely one of the 72 Chess Pieces.</p><p>Upon realizing this, they both deeply regretted fighting so crazily and ending up both grievously injured. Never did they expect that they turned out to be from the same side instead of being enemies.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
