It was emitting out from the patient’s body lying in bed.</p><p><em>Something’s strange.</em></p><p>He thought inwardly and went straight to the bed. He reached out to move the quilt and grabbed her wrist to check her pulse. His frown went deeper as several minutes passed by and he looked even more puzzled.</p><p><em>‘It’s not a sickness! The physique is completely healthy. This woman is not sick, it’s more like she’s sleeping.’</em></p><p>Tang Xiu loosened her wrist and asked Li Cai, “Can you tell me what kind of situation your mother encountered?”</p><p>“I have no idea what happened to her, Divine Doctor Tang.” Li Cai shook her head and said, “She’s been in a coma for several months and fully relies on parenteral nutrition for life support.”</p><p>“Anything comes to mind as to what possibly happened to her before she fell into a coma?” asked Tang Xiu again.</p><p>Li Cai went into deep thought and then said, “Something happened before she fell into a coma.? Mom had nightmares all night and days and almost never slept. Even if she woke up, she was muddle-headed and kept blabbering… blood. She just ignored me every time I asked her.”</p><p>Blood?</p><p>As though realizing something, Tang Xiu cast a sealing technique and instantly hit his glabella. His body trembled a few seconds after as a dreadful force suddenly hit him, causing him to stagger backward three steps and cough up a mouthful of blood.</p><p>“Tang Xiu!!!”</p><p>Ouyang Lulu’s pupils shrunk. She dashed towards Tang Xiu and supported him.</p><p>Tang Xiu wiped off the blood on his lips and looked extremely solemn. He shook his head without a word before coming to the bedside. His vision fell on the woman and he looked a bit complicated at this moment. He wanted to just turn around and leave, but he couldn’t afford to follow the urge.</p><p>Li Cai, who was shocked and scared that something happened to Tang Xiu, hurriedly asked, “Are you okay, Divine Doctor Tang? What exactly happened to my mother?”</p><p>Tang Xiu pondered over something for a second and then asked, “Who else is there in your family? What about your father?”</p><p>Li Cai’s mouth opened, but her expression looked grim and sad.</p><p>Hu Shaokun patted her shoulder and forced a smile. “Li Cai’s life has been pretty much pitiful, Divine Doctor Tang. Her father passed away in an accident when she was seven, whereas her parents were orphans, so auntie Zhuang and Li Cai have always been depended on each other.”</p><p>‘As expected!’</p><p>Tang Xiu grimly sighed and headed to the door while speaking, “Boss Hu, please help find me a quiet room! I need to talk to Li Cai in private.”</p><p>“Alright.”</p><p>Hu Shaokun led everyone to the next room and made a pot of tea by himself. After he offered Tang Xiu, he said, “Do you mind telling me about Auntie Zhuang’s condition now, Doctor Tang?”</p><p>Tang Xiu looked up and shot him a look as he sighed. ” <em>Sigh</em> , if my guess is correct, Li Cai should still be at 15 to 16 years old. And you, Boss Hu, you’ve been exposed to some karmic ties and you may only have 6 days left to live. Furthermore, those who come into contact with the patient will have bad luck and suffer unpredictable events.”</p><p>Hu Shaokun’s expression changed and fear was bred inside him. He didn’t expect Tang Xiu to be able to guess Li Cai’s situation. He fell into silence for a while, then asked with a heavy voice, “What do you mean by that, Doctor Tang?”</p><p>“The patient herself is the source of the problems.” Tang Xiu shook his head and said, “Haven’t you also found the abnormalities in her already?”</p><p>The man thought about it and said, “A chilling energy comes out from Aunt Zhuang’s body, causing the temperature around her to drop to a very low degree.”</p><p>“That’s not just your ordinary chilling air, but is actually noxious energy—something called the origin of calamity and the bane of others’ existence,” said Tang Xiu. “I’m afraid she was destined to be alone right at the moment she was born, and all her loved ones will be killed.”</p><p>The remark angered Hu Shaokun, and he rebuked; “DOCTOR TANG! Please have some respect! We invited you due to your Chinese medicine expertise to treat Aunt Zhuang, not some itinerant expertise on fortune-telling or something.”</p><p>“The art of healing, combined with some mysterious techniques, may be able to lift up medical skills more perfectly. The reason why people hail me as a divine doctor is that I know about such mysterious and profound techniques,” said Tang Xiu. “You’ve taken the patient to many large hospitals to get examined, so you should be crystal clear about her condition. There’s no way the current level of medical science can check her problems if any.”</p><p>Li Cai looked at Tang Xiu like she was seeing her savior and hurriedly asked, “Divine Doctor Tang, you have amazing skills. Have you already grasped my mother’s condition, by chance?”</p><p>“That’s right. But it would be a tall order if I want to save her and wake her up.” Tang Xiu forced a smile and said, “It’s rather difficult to do so with my current strength.”</p><p>Li Cai’s expression instantly turned grim. She had heard a lot about Tang Xiu’s mysterious medical skills and even heard that this man had cured a lot of patients with incurable diseases. But she never thought that he didn’t have the means to wake her mother up.</p><p>“I may not be able to help the patient, but you can,” said Tang Xiu. “It’s just that you’ll need to pay some price.”</p><p>The light was back on Li Cai’s face as she hastily replied, “I’ll do whatever it takes.”</p><p>“Hold up.” Hu Shaokun interrupted. “There are still things bothering me, Divine Doctor Tang. You just said that Auntie Zhuang is the bane of others’ existence and she’d have her loved ones die. But why is Cai’er still alive now? She’s her blood daughter and notably her closest person.”</p><p>“Those who have been in their mother’s womb for nearly 10 months are naturally their most loved ones, mind you.” Tang Xiu sighed. But precisely because of this, Li Cai has an inborn special power to offset the influence of this evil karma. Though, to be honest, I’m now very curious about what the patient did in her past life. To think that the rules of Heaven and the six paths of reincarnation can’t even wipe out this evil karma at all.”</p><p>“You said that Aunt Zhuan’s illness is caused by the evil karma made by her past incarnation?” asked Hu Shaokun with a bizarre expression. “How can that be? Isn’t that too unbelievable?!”</p><p>Tang Xiu glanced at Li Cai and inquired. “Do you mind if I go overboard to see what kind of deeds your mother’s past incarnation has done? And why such evil karma demands retribution in her current life?”</p><p>Li Cai hesitated for a while and then curiously asked, “But how… can this be possible… for you to see the past deeds of my mother’s past incarnation, Divine Doctor Tang?”</p><p>“I naturally have my own means. But I need to tell you in advance that I’ll also see her life experiences while exploring the patient’s life,” said Tang Xiu. “Certainly, it could also make a big difference pertaining to her treatment if I can figure out the cause and effect—shortly put, the karmic ties.”</p><p>Li Cai turned to Hu Shaokun and shot him an inquiry look.</p><p>The man thought for a moment and then said with a solemn face, “Divine Doctor Tang, the most important issue now is her condition. We can agree to it as long as it can help her.”</p><p>“Alright, then. You are all to stay here,” said Tang Xiu with a slight nod.</p><p>Quickly after, he went back to the previous room and arranged a Soul Attracting Array there. He could also use some supernatural powers due to his rapid progress in power, which was now comparable to Nascent Soul Stage experts.</p><p>Attracting human soul and exploring their karmic ties was something no ordinary Nascent Soul Stage cultivator could do, not even immortals were able to achieve it. But he was able to do so since he had been a Supreme in the Immortal World who possessed various profound abilities.</p><p>After arranging the array, Tang Xiu cast the technique and a wisp of his spiritual sense instantly entered the woman’s sea of mind.</p><p><em>Buzz…</em></p><p>An intense sympathy rose inside him after his spiritual sense entered her sea of mind, seeing the short fragments of memories of her past life. It was because of the pitiful life and experience she had been through. At the same time, the evil deeds and karmic ties of her past incarnation were too strong.</p><p>“The cause… the fruit…”</p><p>It took Tang Xiu a few minutes to find the karmic threads in the dark netherworld. He quickly understood the problems with her past incarnation by following these karmic lines. Yet, he couldn’t help but shudder and become greatly shocked upon finding that this woman’s past incarnation was a demonic cultivator who had committed tremendous crimes.</p><p>“Star Gems Domain, Pandemonium Devil Sect, Blood Sacrifice…”</p><p>Two hours were spent as Tang Xiu immersed in the world of sins and killings. If the hands of the most serious criminals on the Earth were covered with the blood of tens or even hundreds of their victims, it was nothing but a drop of water in the ocean and nothing to speak of compared to what this woman’s past incarnation did.</p><p>It was full of killings and the massacres of billions of walks of life. The blood flowed and turned into scarlet ocean; corpse piling up like hills; planets and stars were swept away… even after she had passed, no more signs of life had ever been found on that star domain since.</p><p><em>Her sins…</em></p><p>Tang Xiu opened his eyes with an intense forced smile on his face. He had once been a Supreme in the Immortal World and one who had also committed countless killings there, yet the number and outrageousness were still far inferior compared to what he just saw.</p><p>It was simply too much—a sight that could make one lose his nerve and hair to stand on end.</p><p>Looking at the woman’s pale face, Tang Xiu shook his head and said, “I’m afraid you’d need to go through the Nine Reincarnations of Samsara if you didn’t happen to meet me before you could get rid off this bad karma. Even then, that’s on the premise that your soul doesn’t scatter in the journey. Immortals obtain bad karma due to killings, but there are ways to eliminate it. But you didn’t and instead accumulated it. You even tried to use such bad karma to strengthen yourself. This path of cultivation is really…”</p><p>At the end of the day, Tang Xiu couldn’t find any expression to describe it.</p><p>Using killings to enter the Dao and commited more killings to prove and confirm that Dao itself.</p><p>There had been countless cultivators and Immortals, but none had ever done or gone through such an outrageous path. Even describing this woman as “heartless” was an understatement.</p><p>A few minutes later, Tang Xiu went to the next room. His eyes then fell on Li Cai, who got up from the sofa and spoke to her in a deep voice, “I’ve figured out the truth of the matter and I must throw away my previous ideas. You’re indeed the only one who can make your mother awaken, but it isn’t yet the time. It would need you… to become a different existence from your current self, wherein you’ll need to increase your lifespan as well.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
