The more powerful they are, the more they are able to change their appearances. If this person’s cultivation level has reached the Nascent Soul Stage, he can even remold and reshape his flesh and become what it was when he was young. Just who is this guy, exactly?”</p><p>“The preliminary investigation only shows that Chen Zhizhong has taken a Master about two years ago. But we haven’t yet investigated what he has been taught specifically,” said Wen Feng. “But given Chen Zhizhong’s strength progress in these two years, what he has been taught should be martial arts or cultivation. His Master is Tang Xiu, who is hailed as the young Divine Doctor in China, and is also the owner of China’s Magnificent Tang Corporation.”</p><p>The Magnificent Tang Corporation?</p><p>Elder Wei’s eyes lit up. He once heard of this company. Some of the top-level existences in the Darkwind had once schemed to obtain the sophisticated tech product of this company. It was unfortunate, however, that the Chinese authorities chose to back and support this company, so they had to cancel the plan.</p><p>“Given your character, you must’ve been careful, and you should’ve investigated this Tang Xiu, right? Tell me everything about him!” said Elder Wei in a deep voice.</p><p>A bitter smile appeared on Wen Feng’s square face. He reached out to a wooden box stored in his sleeve’s pocket, cautiously took out a Cuban cigar from the inside, and gave it to the old Wei. He lighted it up for the old man, then bitterly smiled. “Anyway, I’ve indeed sent out many intel operatives to investigate Tang Xiu, Elder Wei. But an invisible force that has been hindering us. That’s why the information on him is very scant and pitiful. Alright, I’ll send someone to deliver you the information.”</p><p>Elder Wei glowered at him and impatiently waved. “Just hurry up! I gotta figure out who’s behind Chen Zhizhong. I wanna know who’s so capable to be able to break the seal I cast on him.”</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Nodding respectfully, Wen Feng immediately ran to do his biding. Just a few minutes later, however, he reluctantly returned to Elder Wei and bitterly said with a forced smile, “Uh, Elder Wei, the branch in Liangang just sent a message. The custodian lost the databank door’s card, so there’s no way to send the information immediately. I have a copy of the card, but I’m afraid I have to go back there myself.”</p><p>“Drag that custodian to me!” yelled Elder Wei. “How the hell can he lose such an important thing? Such dereliction of duty will bring our organization hidden danger! What an imbecile! I’m gonna make him wish to die while keeping him alive!”</p><p>A chill ran down Wen Feng’s back and heart. All he just said was to deceive Elder Wei, while the very reason why he wanted to leave Golden Coast was that he didn’t want to stay in the tiger den anymore. One may be killed by this damned Elder Wei should they not pay attention, especially when the geezer was in a bad mood.</p><p>If you could avoid and hide from this geezer for even a minute, you’d definitely not spend a second more in his presence.</p><p>As long as this “Nether Swap” meeting was over, this old thing would leave China and there would be nothing more he would need to worry about.</p><p>Immediately after, Wen Feng took his four confidants and rode on a car that quickly drove off the Golden Coast. Just after they left, however, the people tasked to keep an eye on the Golden Coast sent the news about it.</p><p>****</p><p>The Blue Ocean Goldfine Hotel.</p><p>Tang Xiu and Chen Zhizhong were hiding in the presidential suite. Suddenly, Tang Xiu’s phone rang and he received the report after connecting the call. Then, he nodded and said, “I see. Capture him and kill the others!”</p><p>After hanging up, he looked at Chen Zhizhong and spoke with a sneer, “Well, Wen Feng actually came out of the Golden Coast in the dead of the night. You have a feud with him, yet he straightly headed out in a hurry just after I broke the restriction seal in your body. There’s definitely something between the two, and it’s likely the person who harmed and started it all should be him.”</p><p>“I have a question, Master,” said Chen Zhizhong.</p><p>“What is it?” asked Tang Xiu.</p><p>“If the person who harmed me is Wen Feng or someone he asked, why didn’t they just kill me directly and only cast such a restriction seal on me, instead? Don’t you think all these moves unnecessary?” asked Chen Zhizhong.</p><p>Tang Xiu’s expression slightly shifted. “That makes sense. They haven’t killed you and instead, put such a restriction seal on you. This could mean they have some schemes in mind which start from your body. But what do they want, exactly?”</p><p>“My guess should be my money,” said Chen Zhizhong. “It’s all they can get out of me.”</p><p>“That speaks volume, too.” Tang Xiu narrowed his eyes and nodded. “Your company’s market value is very high, and you now have more wealth than you did two years ago, about double, right? What’s more, you run a medicinal material business, while cultivators need these precious herbs. Thus, you naturally became prey in the eyes of many people. As long as they can control your life, they’ll obtain a lot of medicinal herbs and capital in the future.”</p><p>“Another one, Master. Didn’t you say the restriction seal they cast on me will cause me to die within three months?” asked Chen Zhizhong. “If I were then killed, won’t that mean their control over me is gone?”</p><p>“Heng, they have the ability to cast such a seal. It’s only natural they can break it too,” Tang Xiu replied with a sneer. “When you fall into desperation, and if the other party tells you that they can solve it, will they just comply with your plea so easily if you ask them? Or will you give them a promise and be at their mercy and be ready at their beck and call?”</p><p>Chen Zhizhong went silent for a while. Then, he slowly nodded and said, “That’s a possibility. Besides, it’s better to live than to die as one only has unlimited possibilities if he’s alive.”</p><p>“The wishful thinking of these people is indeed great, yet they straightly ignored my existence. Also, they did not expect that I can break the seal cast on you.” Tang Xiu sneered. “If my guess is correct, the person who has cast the seal on you must’ve received a backlash. We can count it as a bit of interest paid in advance.”</p><p>Shortly after, he made a phone call and ordered Banshou to make a trip to his hometown, Qinghe County. He ordered him to hike the hill behind the Su Family Village to find the Serene Articulation Grass. Back when he was in the back hill of the Su Family Village, he found a lot of them there, but he didn’t collect them as he thought that there was no great use of it then, though he didn’t expect that it’d actually serve its uses now.</p><p>****</p><p>It was two in the morning.</p><p>On a broad, flat road with dimly lit streetlights, two SUVs were speeding like a whirlwind. At this moment, however, a chilling streak of light suddenly shone from a distance and accurately hit the tires of the forefront car.</p><p>BAM… CREAK—</p><p>As the tries exploded and the brakes sounded at the same time, the black buggy in front turned for six or seven times before it finally hit a phone pole on the roadside. The black SUV behind it abruptly stopped after the sudden braking. Wen Feng, who was sitting in the back SUV, pushed the door and vigilantly swept the surrounding with his eyes. It was all quiet, and there was nothing unusual. Then, he shouted, “Check those in the front car and see if anything happened to them!”</p><p>“We’re good, Boss!”</p><p>Two middle-aged men with a few bloodstains crawled out from the black SUV’s interior in front and quickly went to Wen Feng.</p><p>His complexion ugly, Wen Feng asked, “What the fuck happened here? How did such good tires burst all of a sudden?”</p><p>“I got no idea, Boss.” The middle-aged man shook his head.</p><p>“Well, I’ll explain it to you.”</p><p>A clear voice came from the nearby trees on the roadside. The smirking Jin Shi and four Tang Sect experts surrounded the five people.</p><p>Wen Feng’s pupils shrunk. He could tell that something was amiss a moment ago, yet he didn’t expect someone to ambush him on the road. He even felt amazed since the entire Liangang City was now under the monitoring of the Darkwind organization, where their men occupied all the key communication lines and traffic, so they could closely monitor suspicious people.</p><p>And yet, where did these five bravados come from?</p><p>“Who are you?” asked Wen Feng in a heavy voice while shooting a vigilant glare at Jin Shi’s group of five.</p><p>“I don’t think you need to know that, right?” Jin Shi let out a faint smile. “Just know that you’re doomed and have no way of escaping today!”</p><p>Wen Feng instantly took out the pistol from his waist, unlocking its safety pin and trained it at Jin Shi and pulled the trigger…</p><p>Puff…</p><p>A cold light flashed and Wen Feng’s fingers couldn’t pull the trigger completely. His wrist had been pierced by a sharp dagger, causing the man to retreat two steps with a groan and disbelief in his eyes. He may use guns, but his strong point was his martial arts.</p><p>And yet, he was still too late to react and had his wrist stabbed by a dagger—a situation that caused a chill to ran down his back.</p><p>“Who are you?!!”</p><p>He asked after looking around yet again but found no other figures in the surroundings.</p><p>“I never repeat myself.” Jin Shi sneered. “Our target today is you, Wen Feng, so please make a trip with us! As for the rest, KILL THEM!”</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>The four men behind Jin Shi instantly bolted toward the spots nearby Wen Feng. Their killing movements were like lightning bolts, and they directly killed the four middle-aged men, who had a drastic change in expressions. Even to extent that one of them, who killed a middle-aged man, straightly hit the back of Wen Feng’s head and stunned him directly.</p><p>Jin Shi looked around and said, “Tang An, you can have him!”</p><p>Tang An’s figure emerged out of thin air a few meters away from Jin Shi. At this moment, she was dragging another dead dog-like man. Should Li Laoshan be here, he’d be able to recognize the man. This person was Guo Tao, who was famous as the illustrious rich businessman in Shaanxi.</p><p>BAM…</p><p>Tang An threw Guo Tao on the ground and apathetically said, “I don’t need to cover up but will follow you all the way to the hotel where Grand Master is. I’ll directly solve all the Darkwind’s intel operatives on the way there!”</p><p>“Are you sure you can pull it off?!” asked Jin Shi with knitted brows.</p><p>“Hmph, I’ll never say it if I’m not!” Tang An snorted coldly.</p><p>Having said that, she disappeared yet again.</p><p>Jin Shi could only look at the spot where she just disappeared with a chilling and cold heart. He was very envious of Tang An’s mysterious skill to appear and disappear just like that. Yet, he also knew that he could never practice this kind of technique.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
