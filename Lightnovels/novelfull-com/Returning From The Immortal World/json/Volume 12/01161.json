I’m confident that I can kill those at the late-stage of Spirit Formation now.”</p><p>Gu Yan’er’s eyes lit up and immediately replied with a smile, “Given the speed of your cultivation speed, it’s very likely you won’t take long to complete the nine small stages of the Stars Heavenly Essence and reach a higher level, Master. Wouldn’t you be on par with those at the Crossing Tribulation Stage at that time?”</p><p>“Yeah, if my guess is right, I should be able to contend with experts at Crossing Tribulation Stage, indeed.” Tang Xiu nodded. “Also, completing the nine small stages of the Stars Heavenly Essence Stage will not be limited to this aspect as well. Anyway, how’re your injuries now?”</p><p>“A lot better.” Gu Yan’er smilingly replied, “I’ll be fully recovered in about 2 years.”</p><p>“I see.” Tang Xiu nodded and said, “Then again, it’s still necessary to find you the needed heavenly and earthly treasures, preferable those which has an effect on your injury. Also, Xue Yu has been following you to practice, how is her situation now?”</p><p>“She’s doing great.” Gu Yan’er nodded. “She’s now reached the late-stage of Spirit Formation and her cultivation is very solid. But I have no idea about her state of mind, though. She’s improving much faster on this aspect rather than her cultivation. I think she can directly pass the Spirit Formation Stage right to the Body Integration Stage as long as she can absorb a lot of energy.”</p><p>“That’s great to hear!” replied Tang Xiu. “Then let her continue staying with you to practice! She’ll become a great help after she breaks through to the Great Ascension Stage and I complete the nine small stages of Stars Heavenly Essence later. Anyhow, what about Chen Zhizhong?”</p><p>This time, Gu Yan’er forced a smile and said, “His situation is a bit strange. Although he regained his memories, his cultivation doesn’t keep up. He has been cultivating painstakingly, but the result is contrary to the expectation instead. His cultivation keeps declining rather than advancing. Even now, he’s at the early-stage of Foundation Establishment.”</p><p>“What?” Tang Xiu was surprised.</p><p>“I don’t know exactly what the causes or reasons are. Elder Ji and I have examined his physique many times already. But we found no abnormalities whatsoever. Yet, his cultivation keeps going backward rather than moving forward,” continued Gu Yan’er. “Well, he could have not been able to keep it, including his current Foundation Establishment level, had it not been for his arduous efforts.”</p><p>“Where’s he now?” asked Tang Xiu.</p><p>“He received news from the outside that his son was beaten in Shanghai and is seriously injured, so he rushed back to China,” said Gu Yan’er. “He should be in Star City now.”</p><p>Tang Xiu knitted his brows. “What exactly happened?”</p><p>“I’m not too sure about the specific cause, either,” replied Gu Yan’er. “I only know that his opponent kind of pitted his son due to some purchases or something. There was a conflict between them and his son was then wounded. I heard that he hasn’t woke up from a coma until now. But Junior Sister is currently treating his son, so there should be no big problems with him.”</p><p>“Dai Xinyue?” asked Tang Xiu in surprise.</p><p>“Yup, it’s Xinyue.” Gu Yan’er chuckled and said, “Her medical skills have advanced rapidly over the past years. I heard she’s already very famous in Star City, and even many patients from other regions are flocking there to find her, hoping that they can be treated by her. Also, Xiaoxue said that four Chinese medicine grandmasters in China visited Star City to test her on some medical skills. The result shocked them, and they think that Junior Sister will be a very prominent figure in Chinese medicine many years later. One of them even said that she’ll be very likely to become the new Divine Doctor after you.”</p><p>After hearing this, Tang Xiu didn’t look happy in the slightest but silently sigh and shook his head. “She does have some achievements in Chinese medicine, but she’s been spending her time in this aspect way too much, which I reckon will definitely affect her cultivation. I guess, her cultivation hasn’t yet reached a high level, right?”</p><p>“Yeah, she’s only at the early-stage of Foundation Establishment now.” Gu Yan’er nodded.</p><p>“Did you send someone to give her a lot of cultivation resources?” asked Tang Xiu.</p><p>“Well, she <em>is</em> my Junior Sister, after all, Master.” Gu Yan’er chuckled. “Sending her some cultivation resources is just proper. Though it’s a pity that I haven’t had any chance to chat with her.”</p><p>“No worries about that. You’ll get many chances for that in the future.” Tang Xiu smiled.</p><p><em>Whoosh…</em></p><p>A figure flickered from the distance and approached like a bolt of lightning. In just a few breaths, the person stood in front of Tang Xiu and Gu Yan’er.</p><p>“Master, Grand Master.”</p><p>After saluting, Gu Xiaoxue reported. “I just received news from Japan. Kuwako is in a dire situation and needs help. I’ve already sent some people near Japan to rush over there, but they are only some peripheral and outer disciples, so they won’t be able to do much.”</p><p>“What exactly happened?” asked Tang Xiu with a change in expression.</p><p>“Kuwako has successfully taken over the Head of House Yamamoto about a month ago,” explained Gu Xiaoxue. “But when she was preparing to remove the last figure who has been obstructing her in the Northstar One Blade School, tens of Ninjutsu experts suddenly appeared around that person, two of whom were stronger than Kuwako.”</p><p>“Where’s Tang Guang now?” asked Tang Xiu in a deep voice.</p><p>“He’s already in Japan, but he’s been injured as well after joining Kuwako to fight her powerful enemies,” said Gu Xiaoxue.</p><p>As Tang Xiu’s fingers formed a seal, Ji Chimei instantly appeared in front of him in just a few breaths.</p><p>“Lord.” Ji Chimei greeted respectfully.</p><p>“Yan’er is still injured, so you’ll send us to Japan.” Tang Xiu ordered.</p><p>Ji Chime’s expression slightly shifted and gave a curt nod in response.</p><p>Quickly after, four figures quickly appeared in front of Tang Xiu. They were Mo Awu, Xue Sha, Hei Xiong, and the last person who just broke through to the Golden Core Stage, Hei Wuya.</p><p>“Let’s go!” Tang Xiu ordered indifferently.</p><p>Ji Chimei curtly nodded and immediately released some strands of energy to wrap Tang Xiu and the rest. Before she left, her finger pointed to the distance and then bolted away toward Japan like a meteor.</p><p>Two minutes later, Ji Chimei had brought Tang Xiu and the rest to the sky over Japan. After she released her spiritual sense to cover the entire country, she quickly found Kuwako and Tang Guang in a manor.</p><p>“Who is it?!!”</p><p>A figure quickly rushed out of the square inside the manor lightning fast. More than ten of them were Tang Sect outer disciples. But they immediately wore a respectful face after seeing the people who just came clearly.</p><p>Tang Xiu shot a glance at the direction where Ji Chimei just left and secretly sighed inwardly. The Heavenly Dao of this plane was so powerful that Ji Chimei was only able to exert less than 1% of her power, taking her two minutes to take him and the others here.</p><p>“Grand Master!”</p><p>“Boss!”</p><p>Tang Guang and Kuwako Yamamoto, decorated with decorated in some parts of their bodies, quickly appeared in front of Tang Xiu. They looked relieved after seeing Tang Xiu and Mo Awu’s group.</p><p>Tang Xiu nodded to her in response and said, “Let’s chat later. Lead the way.”</p><p>“Please follow me, Boss,” said Kuwako respectfully.</p><p>In a two-story building, Kuwako waited until Tang Xiu took a seat. Then, she personally made tea and served it for Tang Xiu and spoke afterward, “I didn’t expect you to come this quickly, Sect Master. We thought we’d have to wait for a few more days.”</p><p>“Tell me about the situation here,” said Tang Xiu.</p><p>“I’ve succeeded in becoming House Yamamoto’s Patriarch and also the Vice Schoolmaster of the Northstar One Blade. About 2 days ago, I was able to take over the seat of Northstar One Blade Schoolmaster, but the Northstar’s Grand Elder, Osashi Kitagishi, suddenly attacked me with ten people comparable to Golden Core Stage experts. Two of whom were old men who were outrageously powerful. It was fortunate that Elder Tang Guang was also there, else I’d have died in their hands.”</p><p>Tang Xiu turned to Tang Guang and asked, “How strong are they?”</p><p>Tang Guang recalled the scene for a while and then slowly narrated. “I haven’t yet broken through to the Nascent Soul, so I’m not too sure how strong Nascent Soul experts are. However, those two geezers can definitely suppress late-stage Golden Core experts. My injuries and Kuwako’s were also caused by those two. But…”</p><p>“But what?” asked Tang Xiu with furrowed brows.</p><p>“That Osashi Kitagishi guy didn’t move at all,” said Tang Guang solemnly. “Yet, he can control so many experts under him, which makes me suspect that his strength is superior. Maybe, he really has strength comparable to Nascent Soul experts.”</p><p>Tang Xiu shifted back to Kuwako and asked, “I wanna know the details of this Osashi Kitagishi guy!”</p><p>“Osashi Kitagishi was originally a training instructor in the Northstar One Blade School. He was then promoted after accomplishing a special mission and made a great contribution to the school. He has been showcasing his great abilities ever since he became an Elder. He constantly made contributions that benefit the school and thus, was appointed as Grand Elder and then honored to enter the Elder Council. But as far as I know about him, it’s rather impossible for him to have such formidable strength even though he can enter the Elder Council, let alone controlling so many experts around him. Though I must say that I do have my doubts and suspicions over this matter.”</p><p>“What do you suspect, exactly?” asked Tang Xiu.</p><p>“I suspect that the depths of the Northstar One Blade School are not as simple as what I came into contact with,” said Kuwako. “Although I know none of those experts who appeared alongside Osashi Kitagishi, I suspect they are also from the school—experts that have been groomed in secret.”</p><p>Tang Xiu frowned and said, “You mean… some people in the Northstar One Blade don’t want you to be its Schoolmaster?”</p><p>“That’s right.” Kuwako confirmed in a low voice. “The reason I got the chance to become its Schoolmaster was that I control the current one and forced him to submit to me.”</p><p>“Haih… nothing forcibly done is going to be agreeable. Unwillingness can never produce the desired results.” Tang Xiu sighed and then asked, “So, where’s the current Schoolmaster of Northstar One Blade now?”</p><p>“He… disappeared.” Kuwako shook her head and said, “Even though I control his life and death, which makes me share a particular connection with him, I have no idea why he can shield my perception to sense him, so I don’t know where he is now.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
