He also knew another identity Tang Xiu had as the owner of the Magnificent Tang Corporation, with a net worth of more than 10 billion yuan. He previously thought that he would never meet such a great personage such as Tang Xiu for the rest of his life, but he didn’t expect that he’d receive a notice from his boss to greet Tang Xiu as the General Manager of the Blue Starfish Mansion.</p><p><em>Vroom…</em></p><p>In the midst of the car’s engine, Zhao Dongfeng’s spirit was shaken up. His eyes trained at the four supercars speeding up in the distance. He immediately turned to give a signal to the two staff he brought and then strode forward to greet them.</p><p>“Hello, Divine Doctor Tang!”</p><p>The moment Tang Xiu got off the car, Zhao Dongfeng was able to recognize him at a glance and suppressed the excitement in his heart to greet him.</p><p>Tang Xiu gave him a slight nod in response and then waved at Ouyang Lulu, who was still sitting on the front seat. Then, he said to the former, “Are you from the Blue Starfish Mansion?”</p><p>The man himself was slightly shaken inwardly once he noticed Ouyang Lulu. He was also one of the business people who run upscale restaurants in Shanghai, so there was no way he wouldn’t know Ouyang Lulu’s identity. Seeing how close her relationship with Tang Xiu was, Zhao Dongfeng suddenly felt that the duo was really a perfect match made by heaven.</p><p>“Divine Doctor Tang, I’m the general manager of Blue Starfish Mansion. I’m under the instruction of my employer…”</p><p>The bleached-haired youth and the three others, who were walking shoulder to shoulder shot a contemptuous look at Tang Xiu. He directly interrupted Zhao Dongfeng and proudly said, “Heh, he got ordered by his Boss to greet us. Hey you, Tang Boy. You’ll see that the Blue Starfish Mansion is something the likes of us can enjoy, but not something you’re qualified to spend your time inside!”</p><p>“Is that so?” responded Tang Xiu apathetically. “But I don’t feel like chatting with you.”</p><p>Zhao Dongfeng himself knew who the bleached-haired youth and his gang of four was. They were not Shanghai locals. They hailed from large families and just came to Shanghai recently. However, they had a good relationship with his employer. He had keen eyes as the general manager of Blue Starfish Mansion, how could he not notice the smell of gunpowder between this young man and Tang Xiu?</p><p>However, upon seeing Tang Xiu’s indifference, he hesitated a bit and braved himself to speak. “Young Master Wu, my employer instructed me to pick up Divine Doctor Tang. But I’m sure he’ll definitely be happy and surprised if he knows some good friends of his came visiting.”</p><p>The bleached-haired youth, Wu Dalong, suddenly looked extremely ugly. Zhao Dongfeng’s remarks were like an invisible slap to his face. He just shot a contemptuous look at Tang Xiu, wanting to show off his grace and par of excellence to the belle, yet the result was the smacking slap. He almost straightly left out of fury and shame.</p><p>“Why don’t you shut the hell up, surnamed Zhao?”</p><p>Wu Dalong clenched his fists and sternly raised it. He would’ve punched the man if it weren’t for the two staffs of Blue Starfish Mansion behind him.</p><p>Zhao Dongfeng held his breath. He never thought that Wu Dalong would turn on him all of a sudden. However, he could only suppress his own anger inwardly since he feared the young man’s identity. He forced out a wry smile and said, “I’m telling you the truth, Young Master Wu. You’ll understand when you meet my Boss. Divine Doctor Tang, Proprietress Ouyang, please follow me on board, my employer has been waiting for you.”</p><p>Tang Xiu shot a teasing look at Wu Dalong and let out laughter while holding Ouyang Lulu’s hand and quickly jumped onto the boat.</p><p>Wu Dalong panted and gasped a few times. His eyes then fell to the remaining two staffs and yelled, “What are you staring at like some idiots? Hurry up and take me on board!”</p><p>Having said that, he and the other three also quickly boarded another boat. As the boat rowed, the young man who had been with Wu Dalong suddenly shook his head and said, “I think we’re in trouble, Brother Dalong. And it’s not just your everyday trouble!”</p><p>Wu Dalong stared blankly for a moment before frowning and replying with a cold face, “Just spit it out at once and don’t hold back if you got something to say, Hao Zizi!”</p><p>“You know, that surnamed Zhao addressed that surnamed Tang as Divine Doctor Tang.” Hao Zizi forced a smile and said, “That reminds of someone who has an illustrious reputation as the young Divine Doctor Tang Xiu in the country. It wouldn’t have been an issue if he’s only some Chinese medicine practitioner, but he also has two other identities. You’ve been abroad for a few years and haven’t come back for a long time, so you’ve never heard of him. But the two of them are likely very clear of what I’m saying.”</p><p>The other two young men suddenly had their complexion changed as they suddenly recalled something. One of whom couldn’t help but shiver and hurriedly said, “Stop the boat and go back!”</p><p>“What the hell is going on with you?!” Wu Dalong angrily yelled at him. “Just spit it out if you got something to say. What exactly is the background of that brat, huh?”</p><p>“You must have heard about the Magnificent Tang Corporation, right?” Hao Zizi forced a smile and said, “He’s the Big Boss of that company, Tang Xiu. Further, he’s also a powerful member of the Tang Family of Beijing.”</p><p>The Magnificent Tang Corporation and the Tang Family of Beijing?!!</p><p>Wu Dalong’s pupils shrunk and dread overflowed from his eyes. He wouldn’t have been this shocked if Tang Xiu was only the owner of the Magnificent Tang Corporation, but the Tang Family of Beijing was like a nuke that blasted dread to his heart.</p><p>At present, which prominent family in the country was said to have the greatest power? Undoubtedly, it was the Tang Family of Beijing. Even the super-large family of the capital, House Yao, had been destroyed by this family.</p><p>With a face turned whitish and pale, Wu Dalong stared at Hao Zizi and asked, “Are you not mistaken? That brat… is really a scion of House Tang?!”</p><p>Hao Zizi nodded. “He should be. A friend of mine who went to the capital some time ago to attend the 80th birthday of the House Tang’s patriarch saw Tang Xiu there. I also know another thing from him. Tang Xiu should be the next in line patriarch of House Tang in the future.”</p><p><em>Gasp…</em></p><p>Wu Dalong couldn’t help but gasp a stream of cold air. As a scion of a prominent family himself, he naturally knew the disparity in identity between ordinary juniors of House Tang with the so-called heirs. It would be a bit troublesome should they offend any other juniors of House Tang, but if that surnamed Tang was really the heir groomed to be the future patriarch of House Tang, then this issue would become huge. This small conflict was even likely to implicate his entire family and become their bad luck!</p><p><em>What should I do?</em></p><p>This though raced in his mind and Wu Dalong’s expression was ever-changing in these tens of seconds. He finally gritted his teeth and said, “Let’s go back.”</p><p>Quickly after, the four young men hurried back to the shore and watched Tang Xiu and Ouyang Lulu, who had already landed on the opposite bank. Wu Dalong was silent for a moment and then said, “Zizi and you guys. I need you all to help me with something.”</p><p>“What is it?” asked Hao Zizi.</p><p>“Each of us four take out 10 million yuan. We’ll send the money to Tang Xiu as a token of apology,” said Wu Dalong. “Further, you are to tell him that I’ve been beaten very badly, so I coughed up a mouthful of blood on the boat and was then sent to the hospital for treatment. Also, tell him that I’ve suddenly realized how arrogant I was and that I’m now regretting it so much that I sent you to him to convey him my apology.”</p><p>“About this…”</p><p>Hao Zizi, however, didn’t want to face Tang Xiu after recalling his identity. He was afraid he’d face bad luck of becoming the target of Tang Xiu’s anger if he was in a bad mood. Yet, he didn’t dare to refuse Wu Dalong, either. Even though his family did have some power, it was still inferior to Wu Dalong’s. If he were to refuse this guy’s request, it was likely that his future days would be very difficult to bear.</p><p>Wu Dalong frowned and said in a deep voice, “What’s wrong? You don’t wanna go or something?”</p><p>“I’m going. I’ll cover the money!” Hao Zizi was forced to submit inwardly and hurriedly responded.</p><p>“No.” Wu Dalong shook his head. “It was caused by me, so each of you will just take out 10 million since you’ve been involved all along. However, this matter cannot be handed to someone else because it represents the attitude of the four of us.”</p><p>Only then did Hao Zizi feel relieved. In actuality, he felt a bit distressed when he blurted out that he would cover the money since he didn’t have that much at hand. He would very likely have to borrow it from somewhere had Wu Dalong agreed.</p><p>****</p><p>On the island.</p><p>At the landing port of Blue Starfish Mansion, Tang Xiu and Ouyang Lulu just got off the boat and saw a man and a woman coming from afar. The man in his 25-something was handsome, whereas the woman was only 16-plus years old and was beautiful. Tang Xiu could instantly recognize the latter, Li Cai, who he had a video call with previously, which was also the person he came to see this time.</p><p>“Divine Doctor Tang.”</p><p>Li Cai hurriedly called out to Tang Xiu after coming towards him. Her attitude was very respectful.</p><p>Tang Xiu slightly nodded to her in response and then asked, “May I know where your mother is?”</p><p>Hu Shaokun next to Li Cai was stunned, and his heart was at a loss whether he had to laugh or cry. He may have never met Tang Xiu, but he knew his identity. Yet, he didn’t expect that he’d be straightly ignored and just went straight to the subject right after they met. However, so as to give a good impression, he didn’t wait for Li Cai’s answer and stretched out his hand to shake with a smile. “Hello, Doctor Tang. I’m Hu Shaokun, the owner of this Blue Starfish Mansion. Aunt Zhuang is currently in the guest room now, and her condition is not optimistic.”</p><p>Tang Xiu shook hands with him while observing him. Then, he nodded and said, “Let’s leave the pleasantries aside since I came here to treat the patient. Please lead the way, we’ll chat when the treatment is over.”</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>After the swift and crisp reply from Hu Shaokun, he and Li Cai took Tang Xiu and Ouyang Lulu inside. Soon after, the group then came to the room where the patient was staying.</p><p>The interior was luxuriously decorated, and the room was bright and spacious with the scent of jasmine flowers wafting in the air. The sun shone through the windows into the room, reflecting the pale-faced thin woman lying on the bed.</p><p>“Huh?”</p><p>Tang Xiu furrowed his brows right after he entered the room because he was keenly aware that the temperature inside was a few degrees lower than the outside, yet there was no air conditioner or other refrigeration appliance inside.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
