Though I did realize something through this matter.”</p><p>“On what issue?” Mu Wanying was confused.</p><p>“Well, I just found you’ve already become quite an aunt even who picked up a gossiper perk before you become a mother, LOL.” Tang Xiu went on, “You have too much idle time recently, so you got your mind full of thoughts while crunching some fried watermelon seeds or something?”</p><p>Mu Wanying looked shy. With her gentle character, she always treated everything lightly with indifference no matter what happened in the past. But her womanly side had been awakened after she got along with Tang Xiu and occasionally revealed her girly side.</p><p>The leisure and free time always fleeted by quickly, and 2 days had passed in the blink of an eye. The news hadn’t spread out that Tang Xiu had returned to Shanghai, so he had been very leisurely in these 2 days, and no troublesome matters disturbed him.</p><p>Early in the morning, when the first sunshine rose from the east, the newly transferred security captain of the Bluestar Villa Complex, Zhao Fanggang, was silently smoking a cigarette in the sentry post. His eyes swept over every villa owner coming in and out of the complex. Just as he thought nothing unusual would happen at this moment, a Porsche supercar suddenly vroomed and stopped outside the gate with a sudden brake.</p><p><em>Alas, another wealthy scion or miss…</em></p><p>He sighed inwardly. He thought and counted inwardly. He was paid ten grand a month and then counted with his fingers. “How many years would it take for me to afford this 1-million-yuan supercar.”</p><p><em>Creak…</em></p><p><em>Honk, honk…</em></p><p>Several rapid braking was sounded yet again as a few more supercars rushed from a distance and blew their horns. Then, a young man with bleached hair and earrings poked his head out of the driver seat’s window and shouted, “Hey, can you hurry up and not block the gate?!”</p><p>The Porsche’s driver’s door in front was opened and a woman in a red coat, cape, and high-heeled leather boots came out. She turned and glanced at the several supercars behind and shot a look at the listless security guards on both sides, saying, “I haven’t registered this new car yet, so register it for me and remember to allow me to pass through directly later, got it?”</p><p>“Okay.”</p><p>Both guards obviously knew her and even treated her as a goddess or something. One of the young ones immediately ran to the security room after seeing her.</p><p>“What the hell is up?”</p><p>Having puzzled himself after struggling to figure out how many years of salary he’d have to save to buy such a Porsche, Zhao Fanggang looked bitter and sour and asked with a worn-out face.</p><p>The young guard grabbed the registration form and replied with an excited face, “It’s Miss Ouyang, Cap’. I’m gonna register her car first.”</p><p>“Huh? The procedure requires the owners to register the car themselves, right? You just wanna get noticed since she’s so pretty, right, brat?!” Zhao Fanggang grunted.</p><p>“Hey, hey, don’t speak carelessly like that, Cap’,” said the young guard hurriedly. “All the inhabitants living in our villa complex are rich and those who we can’t afford to displease. Especially Mr. Tang and Miss Ouyang. They are on the list of those that must never be offended no matter what, else you can expect to be in for great troubles.”</p><p>“Ehh? Which Mr. Tang and which Ms. Ouyang you’re talking about?” Zhao Fanggang frowned.</p><p>“Some villas in the innermost area are Mr. Tang’s property. Don’t tell me you’ve forgotten what happened a week ago, Cap’? That one outside is Ms. Ouyang. She’s Mr. Tang’s woman and someone we can’t afford to provoke.”</p><p>Zhao Fanggang was shaken inwardly, and his face turned a bit ugly. It was his first time reporting to work here at that time. When he went for the inspection, he was sternly stopped by someone. Even though he showed his identity of security captain, he still wasn’t allowed to enter and thus, led to a clash. He thought that he was already skillful enough and it’d be easy to slap and knock down those few people. The result was him getting knocked out in just three seconds, causing him to crawl up from the ground—something that never happened for a very long time. Later on, he inquired about it and learned from the security team the reason. That was why he secretly recorded the owner of those villas and his men.</p><p>Further, he also knew something. The news was the owner of those villas just returned from some other region or something. He also heard that he brought a woman and they were now in the villa.</p><p>“Anyways, Little Zhao, does Mr. Tang have several women?” Zhao Fanggang asked in a low voice to the young guard who was about to run out of the sentry post.</p><p>“He got a lot. I’ll tell later about that, though,” the young guard replied back in a low voice.</p><p>Having said that, he strode to the security booth and then headed straight to Ouyang Lulu’s car and quickly registered the car’s plate number. But he frowned upon seeing the doors of several supercars behind it being opened. In particular, the Ferrari, since the bleached-haired youth came out and headed to the Porsche in front.</p><p><em>Knock, knock…</em></p><p>The bleached-haired youth knocked on the Porsche’s driver’s seat window. As the window glass came down, he bent down and smilingly sized up Ouyang Lulu a few times, saying, “Well, well, a beauty who just came back from the nightlife? Do you have time to have morning tea with me?”</p><p>“Nope. Got no time.”</p><p>Ouyang Lulu raised the window glass in disgust. As the front railing was opened, she directly started the car and sped up to the interior.</p><p>The bleached-haired youth stroked his chin and murmured, “What a young hot pepper, huh? Never thought about that. Ah, hey, you! Who’s that belle and which villa she lives in?”</p><p>The young guard also knew that this young man was similarly not to be trifled with, and immediately replied, “Ms. Ouyang usually doesn’t live here. But her boyfriend lives here.”</p><p>“The villa numbers!” The bleached-haired youth frowned.</p><p>The young guard shook his head and said, “I can’t do that. We are forbidden to disclose the owner’s information. Please check it yourself if you’d like to know.”</p><p>The youth was angry and was about to hit him. But then, he recalled something and then pointed to another youth before quickly returning to his car. The cars then roared and sped up to the interior.</p><p>After a few minutes, the bleached-haired youth drove the Ferrari and caught up with Ouyang Lulu’s Porsche. But as he kept pushing the car’s horn and drove to the no.10 villa, two black-suited middle-aged men quickly blocked the way.</p><p>“What the hell? Make way, sissies! Did you guys starred in Matrix or something? Are you gonna be an eyesore this early in the morning?” the bleached-haired youth poked his head out and yelled some profanities.</p><p>One of them coldly said, “You’re the first offender here. We’ll spare you this once, but do keep your mouth clean later. These few villas are private residences, and you’re not allowed to enter!”</p><p>“Are you f*****g sick?!” The youth cursed angrily. “This Big Daddy is the owner of this Bluestar Villa Complex! I can go wherever I want. Make way now, else I’ll kill you. Especially you!”</p><p>A chilling light flashed in the man’s eye. He dashed to the Ferrari’s driver seat and forcefully pulled open the door. He dragged out the blond youth from the inside and heavily slapped him and gifted the fella with the last kick after he nearly fainted.</p><p>” <em>Hmph</em> , a cheap mouth deserves to be trashed!”</p><p>The blonde youth slumped on the ground with eyes full of venom.</p><p>Three youths rushed down from the two supercars behind, two of whom ran to help the bleached-haired young man whereas the other pointed to the middle-aged man and shouted, “Who the fuck are you? You dare to hit people here? Believe it or not, this Big Daddy can find dozens of people to break your bones!”</p><p>“Get. The. Fuck. Out!”</p><p>The big man just waved in response, seemingly treating him like a fly, and straightly ignored his threat.</p><p>On the balcony of a villa.</p><p>Tang Xiu slowly opened his eyes as he heard the commotion outside. But he couldn’t help roll his eyes when he saw that it was Ouyang Lulu inside that Porsche. There were quite a few women around him, but he had been in contact with her the most. Had it not been for him stuffing his cell phone into the interspatial ring, it was just a sure hit that he would receive her phone calls and a dozen text messages nearly every day.</p><p><em>Ugh, no shit. I put away the phone into the interspatial right. I haven’t received any calls for the last 2 days, and it’s likely that she called me. What a headache. I didn’t tell her I came back. This great auntie will definitely go ballistic with her concern.</em></p><p>The moment Tang Xiu thought about it, he couldn’t help but feel a headache. There was also one thing that made it worse. Mu Wanying was still on the bed in the bedroom, too tired due to last night and hadn’t gotten out the bed until now. Ouyang Lulu would probably go crazy if she saw her.</p><p>He shook his head wordlessly, got up and went back to the bedroom, only to see Mu Wanying still sleeping soundly. He quickly dressed up neatly but then heard Ouyang Lulu talking to the housekeeper just as he went down the staircase.</p><p>“Lulu…”</p><p>Tang Xiu walked to her in strides while interrupting their conversation.</p><p>Ouyang Lulu’s eyes immediately lit up upon seeing him and unhappily grunted. “When the heck did you return to Shanghai, huh? Why didn’t you tell me?”</p><p>“It’s been 2 days and, well, I haven’t called you since I got occupied by something.” Tang Xiu smiled. “If anything, I was about to call you up, but it turns out you ended up coming here.”</p><p>“What the hell happened to your cell phone, though?” Ouyang Lulu grunted. “I kept calling you, but it said that you were not in the service area. Did you put it in your interspatial ring again?”</p><p>“You’re just like my parents, knowing me inside out, Lulu.” Tang Xiu praised, raising his thumbs up. “I even suspect that you’ve become a worm residing in my belly, you know.”</p><p>Tang Xiu’s response was much to her liking, but she still rolled her pretty eyes at him. She skillfully moved her hands to hug Tang Xiu as she always did and smilingly said, “Bah, you’re the worm! I don’t care anymore. I’ve caught you now since you’re back, so you will go out with me!”</p><p>Tang Xiu just let out a smile. After the housekeeper left, he nodded and said, “Alright, let’s stroll around since you wanna go out! Besides, I got nothing to do today. Strolling around, shopping, watching a movie, having dinner… it’s your call.”</p><p>“Alrighty, then!”</p><p>Ouyang Lulu finally beamed with a smile and she almost dragged Tang Xiu to run outside.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
