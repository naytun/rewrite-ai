Hu Shaokun next to her was similarly dumbfounded. The way he looked at Tang Xiu was almost like looking at some conman who tried every trick to mislead the public with a look that believed that his lies were real.</p><p>“You didn’t mishear nor did you misunderstand me.” Tang Xiu nodded. “You must increase your lifespan, or you’ll only have a few days left to live.”</p><p><em>BAM…</em></p><p>Just as his voice faded away, Hu Shaokun slammed the table and yelled at Tang Xiu, “Doctor Tang! I’ve always respected the Chinese medicine profession and I’ve always admired your achievement in creating a big company such as the Magnificent Tang Corp. at a young age. But even if you hail from House Tang, I still must say to you today… do spare us your absurd remarks and do not ever joke with Aunt Zhuang’s condition!”</p><p>Tang Xiu was silent for a moment before he forced a smile. Hu Shaokun’s outburst was within his expectation since the man was, after all, just an ordinary person. This guy simply had no idea that there were such people in this world, unaware that he had such a remarkable supernatural power himself.</p><p>Explanation?</p><p>He didn’t feel that it was necessary. He was acting as a doctor, and he had his own means of treatment. Since the man didn’t believe him, then it was up to Li Cai’s choice. He’d lose the only means to awaken this woman surnamed Zhuang if she chose not to believe him, meaning that the woman could only wait for death to take her.</p><p>Therefore, Tang Xiu’s eyes fell on Li Cai’s face.</p><p>Some doubts and hesitation did fill Li Cai’s heart. But after a short ten seconds, the doubts and hesitation all disappeared from her face. She could somewhat believe the issue with increasing lifespan since she thought that there were numerous mysterious cases in this world, while Tang Xiu himself was very likely to have such means.</p><p>Further, it was not blind trust either. It was due to her own physique—an instance that couldn’t be explained by today’s science. Her mother was also another example. She was living, yet the thermometer showed 36.5 degrees when checking her body temperature. Even many medical experts had been puzzled by the chilling energy in her body.</p><p>“I believe in you, Divine Doctor Tang,” said Li Cai slowly with eyes radiating inexplicable splendor.</p><p>Hu Shaokun’s expression, however, changed and he angrily cried out, “Cai’er, Divine Doctor Tang was just kidding. Who could possibly be able to increase their lifespan in this world? Even if you can make someone else live a long life, that will only happen if you got good healthcare and live a good, healthy life.”</p><p>“Boss Hu, Li Cai is a family member of the patient. She chose to believe me, so it’s my obligation to consider the patient’s condition.” Tang Xiu waved and said, “The method I use may be incomprehensible for you, but there’s nothing you can help in treating the patient, either. So, please step back.”</p><p>Anger burned inside Hu Shaokun’s heart. He would’ve spat on Tang Xiu’s face if it wasn’t for this man’s identity. Aunt Zhuang didn’t have any blood relationship with him whatsoever, but he kept remembering how she had taken care of him for more than 10 years.</p><p>Back in the past when the Hu Family faced big problems in their business, it was her who struggled to mend the situation of his family’s company by infusing a large capital to help them lift the crisis. Even the death of her past husband was related to his family’s condition then. That was why he always treated her as a family member, closer than his own blood even though they were not related by blood.</p><p>Now, however, Tang Xiu, who was hailed as a Divine Doctor by the people in the entire country, just cracked a joke about her condition. That was truly unbearable for him.</p><p>Hu Shaokun took a deep breath while watching Tang Xiu’s indifference and suppressing the anger in his heart. Then, he spoke, emphasizing each and every word, “Tang Xiu, I may have no blood relationship with Aunt Zhuang, but she’s like a mother to me. She has been treating me like her own son ever since my mother passed away. You can ask Cai’er, I’ve always been with Aunt Zhuang and Cai’er every time we celebrated the New Year festival. Even my grandfather and my old man will also send people to bring them to celebrate it in our residence. I won’t bother explaining if you were someone else, but you’re <em>that</em> Tang Xiu, which is why I’m hoping you can understand. I’m not any stranger nor am I a bystander, so I won’t step back. I need to understand the whole proceedings on her treatment.”</p><p>“Is that so?” Tang Xiu indifferently glanced at him and then turned to look at Li Cai.</p><p>The girl hurriedly nodded. “That’s right, Divine Doctor Tang. Brother Shaokun is really the closest relative I’ve ever had besides mother. Mom took care of him for several years as her own son when he was a child. He’s indeed a family member to us.”</p><p>Tang Xiu slightly nodded in response upon hearing the confirmation. He looked back at Hu Shaokun and said, “The patient needs a very valuable medicine for treatment that will cost me quite a physical and mental effort. Since you regard the patient as a relative, I think a 100 million yuan as treatment fee is not that much, no?”</p><p>“Pardon?”</p><p>Hu Shaokun seemingly couldn’t believe his hearing and looked at Tang Xiu incredulously. He almost jumped and shouted some curses.</p><p>100 million yuan for treating Aunt Zhuang? Is it some miraculous elixir to cost that much?</p><p>Tang Xiu raised his brows and lightly asked, “What’s wrong? Is it too expensive and you don’t like it? I can choose not to continue the treatment if it’s too expensive for you.”</p><p>Li Cai shot a glance at Hu Shaokun and then to Tang Xiu. After hesitating, she said, “Cai’er will give you 100 million yuan, Divine Doctor Tang. I’ll still gift you a more valuable present so long as you cure my mother.”</p><p>“It seems to me that you really have money. Alright, I’ll continue my treatment and open the price.” Tang Xiu shook his head and said, “In actuality, money is meaningless to me, but Boss Hu doesn’t trust me, so don’t blame me for demanding more. I want 49% shares of the Blue Starfish Mansion.”</p><p><em>HISS…</em></p><p>Despite having a faint hunch, Hu Shaokun didn’t dare imagine that Tang Xiu’s appetite was so huge. 49% shares of the Blue Starfish Mansion? It must be noted that the total net worth of this establishment was absolutely over 2 billion, yet he actually…</p><p>Li Cai fell into silence for a few seconds and slowly said, “My family has a total net worth of 3.6 billion, Divine Doctor Tang, which I just learned recently. I’ll transfer all of it to you if you can completely cure my mother’s condition. But can you stop pulling Brother Shaokun in this matter?”</p><p>3.6 billion?</p><p>Tang Xiu squinted and shook his head while saying, “I already told you that wealth is meaningless to me. I only need 49% of Blue Starfish Mansion’s shares. If he agrees, I can choose not to ignore his opinion when treating your mother. But if he doesn’t, that means he never regarded you and your mother as family members. Thus, he doesn’t have the qualification to know how I proceed with the treatment.”</p><p>Hu Shaokun deeply gasped yet again. His eyes turned a bit bloodshot at this moment as he glared at Tang Xiu’s indifferent face. Regret overflowed within him. He wouldn’t have questioned this man had he known it would develop to such a situation. But wasn’t he himself who spoke big that he could prolong someone’s lifespan? Didn’t he say that he had the means to treat Aunt Zhuang? Then might as well let him continue the treatment as it wouldn’t be too late to worry about anything if it turned out he couldn’t cure her!</p><p>But still, 49% of the Blue Starfish Mansion shares?!</p><p>This entire resort may be fully owned by him alone, yet it was all the wealth he inherited from his family nonetheless. The Hu Family was a big family with a lot of assets, but he still had two older brothers. So as to prevent these three brothers from clashing due to the family’s properties, the patriarch divided the family’s wealth to them earlier, wherein the family’s total assets were divided into three parts and the three brothers would get equal shares.</p><p>In case… he gave 49% shares of the Blue Starfish Mansion to Tang Xiu, then his personal loss would be too big to bear, right? However, if Tang Xiu really could heal Aunt Zhuang and he chose to give up now, he was afraid his conscience would be condemned and he’d spend the rest of his life in pain and regret.</p><p>What a m*therf*cker!</p><p>He angrily cursed inwardly but made up his mind. He could earn wealth again if he lost it, but he’d lose a mother in Aunt Zhuang if she died.</p><p>Enduring his distress, Hu Shaokun said, “Tang Xiu, I agree to transfer the 49% shares of the Blue Starfish Mansion to you, so long as you can cure Aunt Zhuang’s illness…”</p><p>At the side, Ouyang Lulu categorically interjected. “Heh, I’ll give you Paradise Manor if Tang Xiu can’t cure the patient’s illness. You have my word on it.”</p><p>Hu Shaokun was shaken inwardly, and an incredulous look appeared on his face. He already knew that Ouyang Lulu was the Paradise Manor’s owner, yet he never expected that her trust in Tang Xiu was so high.</p><p>The Paradise Manor’s total assets may not as good as the Blue Starfish Mansion, but it wasn’t that far off either. What’s more, he only needed that 49% shares as the gambling stake. It was still a win regardless of the outcome.</p><p>“Then I agree!” Hu Shaokun clenched his fist and replied seriously.</p><p>Tang Xiu smiled and glanced happily at Ouyang Lulu. Then, he nodded and said, “Please come with me to the next room, Li Cai.”</p><p>“I’m going too,” blurted out Hu Shaokun immediately.</p><p>“I’m going to prolong her life and increase her lifespan, mind you.” Tang Xiu waved and explained. “It’s impossible for any outsiders to know the means, so you can’t follow us. But you can be present when I treat the patient.”</p><p>Hu Shaokun thought for a moment and nodded wordlessly.</p><p>Quickly after, only Hu Shaokun and Ouyang Lulu were left in the room. Hu Shaokun himsel had long been an admirer of Ouyang Lulu due to her bearing and beautiful look, and he had always wanted to pursue her. But he had been helping Aunt Zhuang to contact the major hospitals all over the world, so he didn’t have time to make his advance and delayed it until now.</p><p>The flower, however, already had an owner now, wherein the owner himself was not someone he could afford to provoke, so he could only sigh inside and give up in silence.</p><p>Looking at Ouyang Lulu’s beautiful face, Hu Shaokun slowly spoke, “I know that you and Tang Xiu are lovers, Ms. Ouyang, but is it worth it for you to use the Paradise Manor to please him?”</p><p>Ouyang Lulu shrugged in response and smilingly said, “That was not my intention! If doing that will make him so happy, then I’m willing to give it to him at once and let him do what he wants with it.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
