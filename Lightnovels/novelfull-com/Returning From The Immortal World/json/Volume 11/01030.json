You’re a bad guy. Little Wuwu doesn’t want to stay in that small world anymore.”</p><p>Tang Xiu didn’t even spare a glance at the Violet Fairy. His eyes looked like they were able to see through people’s minds as they locked on Han Qingwu’s face, scrutinizing every minute of her expression. He keenly captured the moment when Han Qingwu’s pupils shrunk as the Violet Fairy rushed out of the container. He could also see that her body was slightly trembling.</p><p>Sure enough!</p><p>Eyes filled with a frosty light, Tang Xiu’s figure flickered and instantly appeared in front of the Violet Fairy. He caught her lightning-fast and his vision trained back at Han Qingwu. “You said you’ve never seen this immortal tool from the Plant World, so you’ve never seen this little thing either, haven’t you? Violet Fairy, the last bloodline of the Violet Fairy race in the Immortal World with such a lofty status as the Princess of the Violet Fairy Clan.”</p><p>Han Qingwu’s fingers subconsciously pinched the corner of her clothes. The more her eyes fixedly stared at the Violet Fairy, the more intense the palpitation quaking her heart became.</p><p>The Violet Fairy struggled in pain due to the huge force of Tang Xiu’s grasp. She looked at Han Qingwu and immediately looked excited after seeing her face, screaming joyfully, “MASTER!!! Little Wuwu really misses you! Quickly save Little Wuwu, Master!”</p><p>Han Qingwu’s shivering heart became more intense as she watched Tang Xiu exert increasingly more strength to his fingers. She hurriedly called out, “Don’t hurt her, Tang Xiu!!!”</p><p>“Heh, you haven’t answered my question yet.” Tang Xiu sneered. “Besides, didn’t you say you have never seen her?”</p><p>Han Qingwu fell into silence. ‘What and how to answer? Say I haven’t seen her?’</p><p>Tang Xiu kept exerting more strength on his fingers. Amid the panic screams of the Violet Fairy, he slowly said, “It’s truly pitiful, isn’t it? To think that the last bloodline of Violet Fairy clan would be abandoned by her Master, being left alone and forsaken in this world. But I think that death would indeed be her salvation and relief. At least she doesn’t need to endure pain and loneliness in her life yet again. Maybe she can even see her relatives after passing through the cycle of reincarnation! No… I recall that all her relatives should have had their bodies and souls shattered, no? Then I’ll help her till the end. I’d better destroy every lasting mark of her soul and let her disappear from the world for eternity!”</p><p>At this time, only then did Han Qingwu’s countenance looked tragic. Pain flitted across her eyes as she clenched her fists and nails deeply pierced her palms. Her blood bleeding out as she tried to stand firm despite her swaying figure. She shook her head and said, “Don’t hurt her, Tang Xiu. I’ll tell you everything. I’ll tell you everything you want to know!”</p><p>Tang Xiu loosened his fingers and shouted fiercely, “THEN TELL ME, WHY DID YOU DO IT?!”</p><p>White teeth biting her red lips, Han Qingwu shot a deep glance at the Violet Fairy caught by Tang Xiu. She shut her eyes while despair and desperation were all over her face.</p><p>Time ticked by and a minute and a second passed by!</p><p>After ten minutes, only then did she open her eyes again. But her eyes now looked dead and her voice was somewhat hoarse as she uttered the words, “Master’s commandment is hard to break.”</p><p>Frosty light gleamed in Tang Xiu’s eyes and he coldly snorted. ” <em>Hmph</em> . Zhu Wushou truly has a good disciple, doesn’t he? Scheming for thousands of years; disregarding and ruining the happiness of his innocent eldest disciple just so she committed suicide to kill me. <em>Hmph</em> … Still, one thing is unclear. Just when did the Shade Demon Zhu Wushou see me as an enemy?”</p><p>“Y-you… you know my Master is the Shade Demon Zhu Wushou?” Han Qingwu muttered with disbelief on her face. “H-how… how is this possible?”</p><p>“Heh, what’s done by night will appear by day.” Tang Xiu sneered yet again. “You haven’t answered my question yet. Why did Shade Demon Zhu Wushou scheme against me and want my life?”</p><p>“My life is his, and I’ve given it back to him in the Immortal World.” Han Qingwu bitterly said, “I entered the reincarnation cycle and transmigrated to Earth, freeing myself from the bond between master and disciple with him, no longer bound by the threat of the Curse of Time he cast on me. That’s why I can tell you about it, but I hope you promise to fulfill my request after that.”</p><p>“Then, pray tell,” replied Tang Xiu frostily with surging killing intent in his heart.</p><p>Han Qingwu calmly walked to Tang Xiu’s front, disregarding his killing intent. She opened Tang Xiu’s fingers one by one, took the Violet Fairy and gloomily said, “Promise me first that you’ll fulfill any request I ask from you.”</p><p>” <em>Hmph</em> . You know me, why insist on a promise?” hummed Tang Xiu.</p><p>“I do understand you, Tang Xiu, so that’s why I want your word,” said Han Qingwu. “You can rest assured that I won’t request anything that will harm any of your interests, nor will I let you make a difficult decision. It’s even an absolutely easy promise for the current you to fulfill.”</p><p>“I give you my word,” replied Tang Xiu.</p><p>While staring at Tang Xiu deeply, Han Qingwu unhurriedly said, “As a member of Vermillion Bird Holy Sect, you should be very clear about the meaning of this line: White Aigrette and Unscathed of Vermillion Bird Holy Sect slaughtered myriads of races and the Perfected Golden Immortal Pathmarker, shouldn’t you?”</p><p>White Aigrette and Unscathed slaughtered myriads of races?</p><p>Tang Xiu trembled, countless turbulence rippling in his heart. White Aigrette and Unscathed were his mother’s and father’s names in the Immortal World. White Aigrette was the daughter of the Vermillion Bird Holy Sect’s Sovereign, whereas Unscathed was just a common disciple, and they were in love with each other. However, their love led to the opposition of countless people even though the Acting Sovereign, Tang Xiu’s grandfather, was very satisfied with Unscathed. He treated and fostered him like his own biological son until the couple eventually stepped into the Perfected Golden Immortal Stage.</p><p>As for the Pathmarker Zheng Dao, when White Aigrette and Unscathed left the Vermillion Bird Holy Sect, they traversed the Immortal World, Demon Realm and Monster Realm for 3,000 years unhinderedly, where they slaughtered countless of their enemies and finally advanced to the Perfected Golden Immortal Stage after killing Pathmarker.</p><p>Eyes fixedly staring at Han Qingwu, Tang Xiu said with a deep voice, “Among those people killed by my parents, was there any of the Shade Demon Zhu Wushou’s relatives?”</p><p>“It was far more than relatives. His parents, brothers, sisters and all the friends he had when he was young. All of them died in the hands of your parents,” answered Han Qingwu gloomily. “Harboring this blood enmity for a very long time, Zhu Wushou kept advancing in cultivation level and got stronger and stronger. In order to control time for the purpose of reviving his loved ones from the perpetual river of time, he then chose the Dao of Spacetime.</p><p>“However, your parents always stayed at the Vermillion Bird Holy Sect ever since they broke through into the Perfected Golden Immortal Stage. They rarely went out of the sect, and even though they did leave occasionally, they quickly returned. Hence, Zhu Wushou kept waiting for many years and didn’t give up his revenge. But he gradually began to transfer his hatred to the loved ones of White Aigrette and Unscathed. You have been fortunate since you had two Perfected Golden Immortal experts protecting you in secret. Unless you encountered life and death crises, they always hid in the dark while protecting you as you slowly grew up.</p><p>“However, you had many clansmen, many of whom met their demise or disappeared without a trace under Zhu Wushou’s schemes. Your Vermillion Bird Holy Sect also noticed it and conducted the investigation for a very long time, but found no clue and just let it go.</p><p>“As you grew stronger and stronger and then advanced to the Perfected Golden Immortal Stage, the two experts who always protected you returned to the Vermillion Bird Holy Sect. And that was about the time when Zhu Wushou put me as a chess piece in his machination.</p><p>“Unfortunately for him, and despite his countless divinations and calculations, your aptitude and talent in cultivation was so heaven-defying that you broke through into the Supremacy Stage a step ahead of him. All his plans were all for naught. Only then did he perceive the dissatisfaction your close friends had towards you behind your back.”</p><p>Tang Xiu’s countenance went grim and he coldly said, “So to say, you then came onto the stage and waited until I faced my tribulation and ambushed me back then?”</p><p>A painful look flashed across Han Qingwu’s eyes, then she easily concealed it. “That’s right, the Shade Demon Zhu Wushou vowed that as long as we collaborated to kill you, then he would release me from the Curse of Time he cast on me, as well as freeing all my family members; whereas he promised Great Emperor Danqing and Zither Demon Jiuyao to borrow his time-accelerated Chrono Sanctuary to cultivate inside for 1,000 years.”</p><p>All the puzzles, all the thick fog that had long been shrouding Tang Xiu’s heart had now been blown away by Han Qingwu’s story. And yet, the betrayal of his former close friends and his true love left only a shattered heart with heart-rendering pain and a bleeding soul.</p><p>The love that was misplaced, and the kindness that was undeserved.</p><p>Ultimately, everything was just a machination against him—a plot to kill him.</p><p>Had it not been for Han Qingwu poisoning him in advance, it would’ve been very unlikely that he’d lose his life even though Emperor Danqing and Zither Demon Jiuyao joined hands to kill him. Bluntly put, it was Han Qingwu in front of him now who left the gravest and deepest injury… NO… she should be Xue Qingcheng.</p><p>“Why didn’t you hide then?” shouted Tang Xiu, a frosty chill filling his eyes.</p><p>Han Qingwu loosened the Violet Purple and let her fly to her shoulder. Then, she answered with a bitter face, “I owed my Master—a debt I’ve paid off. But I haven’t paid off the debt I owe you. You should be very clear of my, Han… Xue Qingcheng’s personality. Why bother asking?!”</p><p>“You aren’t afraid that I’ll kill you?” yelled Tang Xiu angrily. “Are you not afraid that I’ll erase your soul into nothingness and bar you from reincarnation for eternity?”</p><p>A tender look filled Han Qingwu’s eyes as a gentle smile appeared on her face. She shook her head and said, “I’m not afraid at all. You still remember the request I just told you?”</p><p>The divine sword suddenly appeared in Tang Xiu’s hand out of thin air and pointed to the sky as he sneered. “You want me to spare your life? Dream on!”</p><p>“No.” Han Qingwu shook her head and said, “My request is for you to kill me.”</p><p>“WHAT?!”</p><p>Tang Xiu incredulously stared at Han Qingwu. She had her wish fulfilled; to be reincarnated, reborn, and gain a new life. Reaching the Perfected Golden Immortal Stage was not impossible for her given her former aptitude and abilities. It was even likely that she could advance into the Supremacy Stage given time.</p><p>And yet… her request turned out to be for him to kill her?!!</p><p>Suddenly, Tang Xiu recalled something at this moment and asked with a heavy voice, “Back when you plotted against me with the likes of Emperor Danqing and Zither Demon Jiuyao, why did they kill you? After all, you were the Shade Demon Zhu Wushou’s disciple and you’d completed the mission he gave you.”</p><p>“Does it still have any meanings for you to ask about it now?” asked Han Qingwu back faintly.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
