Figures flickered lightning-fast towards him as he fell.</p><p>“Sect Master!!!”</p><p>With a face full of worries, Mo Awu dashed to Tang Xiu’s side. He didn’t hesitate to take out a few Holy Healing pills and quickly stuffed them into Tang Xiu’s mouth.</p><p>Tang Xiu’s complexion was pale as paper and his body was drenched with sweat. He struggled to squeeze out a smile while and said hoarsely, “Help me sit.”</p><p>Carefully propping Tang Xiu up, Mo Awu then let him sit cross-legged on the ground. Then, he concernedly asked, “Are you really okay, Sect Master?”</p><p>“I lost nearly half of my blood, so it’s a given that I’m now weak.” Tang Xiu shook his head. “But rest assured, though. Nothing will happen to my life.”</p><p>The Blood Ignition Art was a terrifying secret art Tang Xiu created when he was in the Immortal World. This secret art could be used in line with arrays, so he could kill enemies that were ten times stronger than him. It could turn the whole array into a solid melting furnace to melt all the lives inside it.</p><p>At this moment, dozens of human experts rushed to Tang Xiu—the three Nascent Soul Stage experts, Duanmu Lin, and Han Qingwu, who stopped playing her zither. All of them heard Tang Xiu’s remark and wore extremely shocked complexions. They never thought that Tang Xiu would use such a method to kill demonic beasts, losing nearly half of his blood.</p><p>For human beings, their blood was the most important before they ascended and became immortals. Only death awaited them should they lose too much blood.</p><p>Duanmu Lin slightly shivered. After kneeling beside Tang Xiu, he said with full respect on his face, “I may not know what you’ve done, Tang Xiu. But I believe you did it for our country, for the sake of humanity as a whole. Thank you. Please take a rest and recuperate well. Just give us those demonic beasts to slaughter. We won’t let you be killed as long as you’re alive.”</p><p>Tang Xiu let out a vague smile wordlessly. His eyes, however, swept around and paused a second after they landed on Han Qingwu’s face, who looked very worried.</p><p>“Everyone, I’ll leave the rest to you for the time being. I need to recuperate first, so please do what you must do!”</p><p>After saying that, he directly shut his eyes and immersed himself into cultivation.</p><p>Duanmu Lin looked at Mo Awu and said in a deep voice, “Assign some people to protect Tang Xiu. We’re going to slay those demonic beasts. But keep in mind that if you see that the situation is going south, immediately take Tang Xiu and leave this place!”</p><p>“Rest assured.” Mo Awu nodded and said, “Sect Master’s life is more important than mine.”</p><p>Suddenly, an exclamation came out from the crowd, “Heaven! What just happened? How come the array in front… is burning?”</p><p>In that instant, everyone’s eyes shifted to the Demons and Immortals Slaughtering Array. The scene of the array gradually turning scarlet shocked them the most. It was like it had turned into a gigantic melting pot, even the thousands of cultivators could hear the howling and screams of the tens of thousands of demonic beasts.</p><p>Han Qingwu had a distressed look in her eyes. Then, she vaguely said, “It’s because of the Blood Ignition Art activated in line with the Heaven and Earth array. Once both activate at the same time, it will burn down all the enemies inside the array completely, unless they are strong enough to escape. However, those who cast this Blood Ignition Art must force out a huge amount of their blood to be condensed into blood essence, which will create a harming backlash and leave the caster in a very weak condition. He… he just used… his life to slay those demonic beasts.”</p><p>Duanmu Lin and the three Nascent Soul Stage experts, as well as nearly 100 other cultivators around, gasped in cold breath and turned to look at her.</p><p>Duanmu Lin walked a few steps towards Han Qingwu and said, “Thank you for lending a hand a while ago, Miss Han. If anything, if Tang Xiu’s condition is not very good, could you help him…”</p><p>Han Qingwu shook her head and interrupted him with a bit of bitterness on her face and tone. “I have no way to help him. Even if I do, I’m afraid he won’t let me help him.”</p><p>“Huh?” Duanmu Lin frowned and asked, “Why? Aren’t you two very close?”</p><p>Deep love and concern were on Han Qingwu’s face as she shot a deep gaze at Tang Xiu. Then, she streaked into the sky for several hundreds of meters, sat cross-legged mid-air, put the zither on her lap and began playing it again to affect the demonic beasts inside the Demons and Immortals Slaughtering Array.</p><p>“FUCK!!!”</p><p>Archfiend Rupture furiously roared again and again. It had been seriously affected since it rushed into the array. Originally, it intended to kill Tang Xiu with its own power and destroy this array. But not only did it fail to kill him, but it also pushed itself into this pit instead. But what made him furious the most was the deaths of countless demonic beasts.</p><p>“RUN!!!”</p><p>“ESCAPE!!!”</p><p>The other two demonic beasts who were comparable to the Nascent Soul Stage experts shouted right after Archfiend Rupture. They could tell they wouldn’t be able to break this array with their powers, neither would they be able to rescue all their kin. They even sensed a very strong crisis looming over them. As if sensing that this furnace-like array would send them right into hell once it blew up.</p><p>Archfiend Rupture let out several furious roars. Yet, it couldn’t help realizing that it wouldn’t be able to break this array. As a sense of crisis loomed, with its high intelligence, it eventually thought that escaping was the best choice.</p><p>“Divides…”</p><p>Displaying another supernatural power, more than 100 of its shadows appeared in an instant as they grabbed tens of Golden Core Stage demonic beasts. At the same time, the other two Nascent Soul Stage demonic beasts gathered. Countless black holes then appeared in an instant, while a black chain bombarded a certain spot and tore an opening in the array. Eventually, the battered two Nascent Soul Stage demonic beasts and the tens of Golden Core Stage ones escaped from the Demons and Immortals Slaughtering Array.</p><p>BOOM…</p><p>A huge power blasted out from the Demons and Immortal Slaughtering Array. The explosion looked like a mushroom cloud that spread in all directions. Tens of thousands of demonic beasts trapped inside it met their cruel deaths along with the blast, leaving only their Demon Cores on the ground.</p><p>In a flash, Tang Xiu, who was previously sitting cross-legged on the blockade line, opened his eyes. His eye lit up and he had recovered his ability to move after a short recovery. He quickly dashed into the tens of meters deep and tens of kilometers wide large pit. His qi swept over and quickly gathered all the Demon Cores and stored them into his interspatial ring.</p><p>“That was…”</p><p>Thousands of human cultivators were scared shitless, including the three strongest Nascent Soul Stage experts. They were staring dumbly, tongue-tied as they saw the dreadful scene in front. They could only watch Tang Xiu’s continuous flashing figure with gasping breaths.</p><p>It was… all too terrifying!</p><p>Although they didn’t know how many demonic beasts had entered this array, the power of the explosion from the array was so great that it sent a tsunami of dread into their hearts.</p><p>After half a minute, Tang Xiu had sucked all the Demon Cores into his interspatial ring. After he sensed its inside, he counted 45,620 Demon Cores, which meant that he had paid a grievous cost, yet had successfully slain 45,620 demonic beasts.</p><p><em>It should be half of them, give or take.</em></p><p>Feeling satisfied, Tang Xiu nodded. Then, he turned and flew towards Duanmu Lin and smilingly said in a clear voice, “Nearly half of the demonic beasts have been slain by me, Senior Duanmu. However, all the arrays I’ve arranged here have been destroyed. I’m afraid we must face them head-on next.”</p><p>“You said you successfully killed nearly half of demonic beasts?” called out Duanmu Lin in surprise. His pupils shrunk and he asked, “How many of them, exactly?”</p><p>“45,620,” answered Tang Xiu.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>This time, it wasn’t only Duanmu Lin who got shocked, but also the rest of the cultivators. There were still some people who didn’t flinch at the moment, and Han Qingwu was undoubtedly one of them. She and Tang Xiu lived together for thousands of years, so she naturally knew how powerful the might unleashed by the array aided by the Blood Ignition Art was.</p><p>Back in the past, Tang Xiu had once pursued an evil race and billions of them were all killed by this method. It was a pity that his current strength was very weak. Compared to power he possessed in his heyday, his current power was but only one ten-thousandth. He would’ve easily obliterated these demonic beasts and the Himalayas itself otherwise.</p><p>“ABSOLUTELY DISGRACEFUL!!!”</p><p>Suddenly, a furious roar came from the depths of the Himalayas. The figure of Bloodfiend Monarch flickered and moved lightning fast. It then instantly appeared in the air over the deep pit. A blob of black flames was spat out from its mouth and instantly blew over to the thousands of humans in front.</p><p>“BLOCK IT!!!”</p><p>Tang Xiu’s complexion drastically changed. A chill filled his heart as he could sense the power of Bloodfiend Monarch from its aura. Its power was… comparable with a Body Integration Stage expert!</p><p><em>It seems like the only option left is to have the Star Devourer Insect act.</em></p><p>Tang Xiu sighed inwardly but then shook his head the moment after. Just as he was about to release Star Devourer Insect, a huge aura suddenly came from Ugley Town. Further, the intense high temperature seemed to light up the earth, and the snow tens of kilometers around it began to melt rapidly.</p><p><em>Another demonic beast?</em></p><p>It was a Fire Qilin with three-storied building high scarlet body and fire all over its body. It flashed in the sky over the blockade line while unleashing its flame to meet the demonic flame head-on. The dreadful blast of energy made all the cultivators present scared shitless as they were forced to retreat toward Ugley town.</p><p>Tang Xiu followed the rest back to the sky above Ugley town. His eyes were fixated at the Fire Qiling fighting the Bloodfiend Monarch with a bizarre expression on his face.</p><p>He remembered this Fire Qilin clearly. Back when he was adventuring with Miao Wentang and Shao Mingzhen to find some treasures, they snatched quite a lot of precious ores from this Fire Qilin nest in the underground labyrinth.</p><p>“This thing… isn’t it trapped in that underground labyrinth? How the hell did it come out and why does it side with humans against that dreadful demonic beast?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
