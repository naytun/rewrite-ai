The Ravengale caught them off guard and their men killed half of the Speeder Union’s people. However, after those demi-humans joined the fray, the Ravengale lost quite a number as well,” said Tom Reggie.</p><p>Tang Xiu continued observing for a few more minutes. Then, he put away the binoculars and said, “The Speeder’s final line of defense should’ve been broken in 10 minutes if it wasn’t for that reinforcement. The Ravengale has so many experts, and some of them haven’t even moved yet. My guess is that they are experts from the Stygian Club.”</p><p>“The Stygian Club?!” Although Tom Reggie had such a guess, hearing it directly from Tang Xiu shook regardless. He even imagined that if the Ravengale’s target was him and his men, it was likely that he wouldn’t last even 10 minutes before getting slaughtered.</p><p>That was so chilling!</p><p>Tom Reggie shivered. He looked at Tang Xiu with a bit of awe and said in a suppressed voice, “Boss, are we just only watching the show today or joining in the fray too? If my guess is correct, the Ravengale will go after the Golden Cauldron after they have trampled the Speeders. Also, given the former’s strength, the latter can only wait for their destruction.”</p><p>“How can we just watch the show after such a godsend opportunity presented itself?” replied Tang Xiu calmly. “Nevertheless, we still need to do something before we move.”</p><p>“What?” Tom Reggie’s spirit rose and he immediately asked.</p><p>Tang Xiu swept over at Tang Guang and the rest, saying coolly, “Tang 28, you’re to stay here, while the rest of you will silence all the informers of various forces in the surroundings. I don’t want any forces to find out any of our actions tonight.”</p><p>“Understood!”</p><p>Tang Guang, Mo Awu, Hao Lei, and Kuwako Yamamoto shortly replied and instantly disappeared from the room. Their speed was so fast that tens of Tom Reggie’s trusted men had drastic changes of expressions with horrified eyes. At a spot they couldn’t see, the air suddenly fluctuated a bit as the hidden Tang An quickly left.</p><p>A surprised look on his face, Tom Reggie asked, “You said there are informers from other forces around here, Boss? But how come I and my men didn’t spot any of them?”</p><p>“You missed them because your men are too weak.” Tang Xiu sneered. “Hmph, there are some rats from at least three forces. Not only are they monitoring the situation around Speeder’s HQ, but they’re also keeping tabs on us. You can expect to be easy prey should any of them think of getting rid of you and your men.”</p><p>Eyes shrunk, Tom Reggie was scared shitless. He didn’t even question Tang Xiu’s words since he knew his abilities. But never once it occurred to him that there were so many operatives from other forces keeping tabs on him.</p><p>“Boss…”</p><p>Tom Reggie opened his mouth but was interrupted by Tang Xiu, who smiled and said faintly, “I know what you wanna say, but keep them in mind now. We just started to silence the rats of those forces in the surroundings. It will only take up to 10 minutes to remove all of them. Tell your men to get ready for action. We’ll move once the Ravengale breaks the Speeder’s final line of defense!”</p><p>“Roger that!” Tom Reggie received the order and immediately walked out of the room.</p><p>The battle at the Speeder’s HQ was very fierce and intense. Both sides were not only using heavy weaponry, but also sending many of their experts to fight. Tens of people from both sides quickly met their deaths in just a short time.</p><p>In the manor about the size of a soccer field, an armed force of Ravengale Chamber nearly 100 strong kept mounting assaults on the four-story building on the innermost side, whereas fire snakes burst out at the windows of the four-story building, creating a frightening fire crossing grid that blocked the enemy’s attack route.</p><p>In the hall on the first floor.</p><p>The Speeder Union’s leader, Jameson’s eyes were overflowing with a chilling light. After smashing his cell phone, he ripped off several buttons on his coat and shouted while taking out a submachine gun, “All the retreat routes are blocked, leaving zero chance of escape to us. Brothers, the reinforcement will arrive as long as we can hold on for an hour. Join me to kill them all, for we’ll be dead should this last line of defense breaks!”</p><p>“KILL!!!”</p><p>Tens of burly men in the hall went trigger happy and targeted the enemies outside who were trying attempting to storm inside, while more than 20 mysterious people in black training suits led by a man with a black mask calmly sat cross-legged in the innermost core. They seemed unaware of the dangerous rain of bullets happening around them.</p><p>Jameson’s ferocious face kept glancing at the 20-plus people hiding in the corner from time to time. Lots of his men had died and only about 50 of them were still kicking, but these 20-plus people were like his hidden trump card. He was perfectly clear that as long as they were here, the reinforcement would arrive in time. He also knew that if these people were to join in the fray, let alone holding on for an hour, even staying for a day or two wouldn’t be a problem.</p><p>Each second and every minute kept ticking by.</p><p>The casualties kept growing in both the Ravengale and the Speeder. The last line of defense of the latter was nearly breached due to the assault from the divergent races of the Ravengale side a few times.</p><p>“Use the injection!”</p><p>As Jameson saw one of his confidants fall into a pool of blood more than 10 meters away with scarlet and white liquid gushing out from the hole on his forehead, his face turned blue and he looked more ferocious. He quickly squatted in the corner, opened a black suitcase, and pulled a tube of blue agents from it. Then, he extracted it with a syringe and quickly injected it into his right arm.</p><p>HOU… HOU…</p><p>A howl similar to a beast’s burst out from his mouth. His face twisted and his whole body violently shivered. Strips of blue veins and blood vessels rapidly protruded out and his physique began to swell at a speed visible to the naked eye. In just a few seconds, his body had grown taller and bigger a few times.</p><p>In the surroundings, tens of Jameson’s men went through a similar situation and began to transform after injecting the blue gene agents. Their eyes turned bloodshot, their speed was faster and they were much stronger than before.</p><p>The battle kept going, yet none among Jameson and his men died after several minutes. Although their injuries increased bit by bit, it seemed that they weren’t even affected at all. On the contrary, several people from the Ravengale were killed in a violent charge.</p><p>At this time, however, the rest of Jameson’s men who were previously in the hall on the first floor with those 20-plus people sitting cross-legged had now moved to a big room on the third floor, leaving only six stalwart men armed with heavy machine guns.</p><p>And yet, those 20-plus mysterious people wearing masks remained sitting cross-legged in the corner.</p><p><em>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</em></p><p>Three shadows flickered and dashed lightning-fast from the distance and came under the building in the blink of an eye. Their speed was extremely fast and seemed like three flashing blue clouds of smoke. They instantly threw three anti-tank grenades to the interior through the window.</p><p>BOOM, BOOM, BOOM…</p><p>Powerful explosions sent the Speeder’s men to their deaths. But at this moment, two mysterious men wearing black masks suddenly disappeared from their spots. They pulled the crescent scimitars from the scabbards on their backs and overlapping blade shadows swept toward the window.</p><p>“Hmph, you’re biting more than you can chew.”</p><p>A long white-haired chiseled man in a black robe coldly hummed with contempt. He instantly dashed inside through the window and easily dodged the sweeping blade of the masked man, throwing a bamboo tube the instant after. Right as he attacked the masked man, the sharp sword suddenly formed sword images that filled air formed to clash with the bamboo tube he threw out.</p><p><em>Hiss… hiss…</em></p><p>Two centipedes made strange hissing sounds. Amazingly, there were thin wings like cicadas on the backs of the two centipedes. They flapped their wings and instantly fell down on the masked man’s shoulder and accurately bit his neck.</p><p>“DAMN!!!”</p><p>The masked man furiously shouted and his black-gloved arms instantly caught the centipedes. But at the moment he smashed them, their terrifying poison quickly penetrated his body through the wound on his neck. The toxin quickly invaded his heart in just a few breaths, causing his burly body to crash to the floor.</p><p>At the same time, the other masked man was also slain by two other strong men in black robes.</p><p>“KILL THEM!”</p><p>Eyes bloodshot, Jameson pointed to the three black-robed men and ordered aloud.</p><p>In that instant, tens of strongmen threw their guns and aggressively charged toward the three people. They were barehanded, but every punch they delivered caused whistling winds that would leave even a martial arts grandmaster scared.</p><p>“Your men won’t be able to deal with them.”</p><p>A light voice entered Jameson’s ear. A bald old man among those 20-plus people sitting cross-legged who wore a string of beads floated out like a ghost. He appeared in the midst of tens of strongmen before his voice faded away. Streams of qi flowed out and forced back six stalwart men, the white gloves worn by the old man leaving its print on one of the black-robed man’s chest.</p><p><em>Puff…</em></p><p>Blood splattered and created a blood mist, yet the white glove remained unstained by the blood. But series of palm shadows filled the air, causing the other two black-robed man’s pupils shrunk. As they were trying to dodge the strike, they suddenly found that the palm’s shadows kept following them and couldn’t be avoided.</p><p>“How can this be?!”</p><p>The two black-robed old men shouted in alarm. Shortly after, they felt like their chests had been smashed by something weighing thousands of kilograms as they flew upside down and coughed blood crazily. They finally crashed down to the window, and it was unknown whether they were still alive or dead.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
