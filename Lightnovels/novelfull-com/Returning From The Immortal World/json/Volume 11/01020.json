As a big man kicked their bodies to wake them, their expression greatly changed as they saw Mo Awu sneering at them. “You foursome truly know how to blow your mouth and talk big, yet you just fainted with one hit? Spit out, who are you? Of course, you can choose to keep your mouth shut, but I don’t think you shits can afford the result.”</p><p>Liu Hao crawled up from the ground and reached out to touch his waist, only to have his expression change as he found that the dagger on his waist was no longer there.</p><p>Mo Awu’s hand moved to the back, took out the dagger, and threw it in front of Liu Hao. Then, he lightly smiled and spoke, “You’re looking for this? That junk poses no threat to us at all.”</p><p>“Who the hell are you guys? For security guards of a restaurant to have such strength is just impossible,” roared Liu Hao angrily. “Might as well tell you that we’re Boss Guo Fugui’s men. You’ve provoked my Boss since you saved Yang Yan and her brother!”</p><p>‘Guo Fugui?’ Mo Awu’s eyes blinked as a puzzled look was cast on his face. It was a name he had never heard of. ‘Is he some kind of bigshot or something?’</p><p>“Never heard of him.”</p><p>Liu Hao stared awkwardly before flipping into a rage. He originally wanted to use his Boss’ name to deter these guys, only to find such a response. They never heard of his Boss? There were still are people in Jingmen Island who had never heard Boss’ name?</p><p>“You got some big balls, Kid!”</p><p>“Heh, spare me the shit talk!” replied Mo Awu coldly. “But I got one thing as to why you followed us here. It’s because of the Yang siblings, huh.”</p><p>“What about Yang Yan and her brother?”</p><p>Tang Xiu, who just came to the parking lot with Gu Xiaoxue, asked with a strange expression after seeing the scene in front of him.</p><p>“Boss!” Immediately saluted the four core members of the Everlasting Feast Hall.</p><p>“We have been followed on the way back here and we’ve interrogated them, Boss,” reported Mo Awu. “They are the subordinates of someone called Guo Fugui, but I’ve never heard of this man before. The one who issued the order to chase Yang Yan and her brother is this man.”</p><p>Tang Xiu looked blank for a moment, then said with a strange expression, “I recall I’ve sent someone to warn this Guo Fugui guy. To think that he still sent his men to track us here is kinda unexpected. Well, it’s kinda funny, though. It seems like I can call Chi Nan back.”</p><p>“Let me call her, Boss,” said Mo Awu as he went to the side to call Chi Nan.</p><p>Liu Hao shot a deep look at Tang Xiu and sneered. “Are you the owner of this Everlasting Feast Hall? <em>Hmph.</em> You’re just a small businessman, yet you dare to poke your nose into my Boss’ business! Are you really that tired of living? Just wait until my Boss comes here, I hope you won’t wet your pants and beg on knees for mercy!”</p><p>“Noisy bug!”</p><p>Tang Xiu slapped Liu Hao’s face, breaking several of his teeth as he sprayed out blood and left him swollen cheek. Then, Tang Xiu said, “Those who yelled and bragged before me never lived for long. This is your first time, but I can spare you. If you dare to spit some more shit I’ll feed you to the sharks!”</p><p>Liu Hao covered his face, losing all his previous confidence. He was a veteran fighter who was a Sanda boxing-style expert for twenty-odd years.</p><p>‘Yet… how come this young man’s speed is so fast? I can’t even follow his movement, and only my vision blurred as he slapped me. How is this possible?’</p><p>Tang Xiu took out a cigarette and clamped it in the corner of his mouth. Gu Xiaoxue swiftly took out a lighter and lit it up for him. Tang Xiu approvingly chuckled as he felt that it was a new, good feeling having his cigarette lit up by a beauty. He then looked at Liu Hao and smilingly asked, “You said your Boss, Guo Fugui, will come over soon, no? How long will it take for him to get here?”</p><p>While covering his cheek, Liu Hao glared at Tang Xiu with visible hatred and answered, “Soon. He’ll be here very soon! He’s already on the way and should arrive in 30 minutes. Call your men now if you wanna. But my Boss is bringing a lot of men here, and you’ll definitely regret it by then!”</p><p>Tang Xiu just shook his head and didn’t bother to refute or talk to him again. He jumped onto the roof of a car, sat cross-legged and slowly closed his eyes.</p><p>In his eyes, Guo Fugui was just a buffoon. Back then in the Paradise Club, Ouyang Yun told him about this gangster fella. He might as well take him on and send him packing if this guy dared to bring his men here.</p><p>Suddenly, his expression shifted and his eyes opened as a mobile phone appeared in his hand. He waved to gesture Mo Awu and the rest to drag Liu Hao’s group a few dozen meters away. Then, he dialed 110 emergency number and called, “Put me through to your Police Chief!”</p><p>“Hello, may I know who you are?” a sweet voice replied from the phone.</p><p>“Tell your Chief that I’m someone from the Security Department!” said Tang Xiu lightly. “My name is Tang Xiu. And if he doesn’t believe it, tell him to call his superior!”</p><p>“…”</p><p>The other party’s voice didn’t reply for a long time. Just as Tang Xiu was getting impatient, the voice of a middle-aged man came out, “Hello. I am Wang Sen, the Deputy Chief of the Public Security Bureau. You said that you’re someone from the Security Department, is there any evidence you’d like to tell us?”</p><p>“Didn’t I tell you to call your superior immediately if you don’t believe me?” asked Tang Xiu. “I got something for you to do. Be quick about it!”</p><p>Jingmen Island, City Public Security Bureau.</p><p>Wang Sen deeply furrowed his brows. There was hesitation in his eyes as he didn’t know whether the caller was genuine or not. But if it was just a prank and he contacted his superior, he could be in for big trouble, or at least get a warning from his superiors.</p><p>However, if the caller was telling the truth, he could expect to have unlucky things happen to him.</p><p>Thinking for several seconds, only then did Wang Sen reply, “Please wait a bit, Mr. Tang. I’ll contact my superior right away. Also, you can tell me more on the phone if you have anything else to report.”</p><p>“Tell your superior that Jingmen Island is quite chaotic now with too many stray puppies and kittens,” said Tang Xiu. “I’ll help him do some clean-up tonight, but the aftermath will be yours to deal with!”</p><p>Wang Sen pondered for a moment and said, “Alright. Please wait for a moment.”</p><p>In a high-end residential area five-plus kilometers away from the City Public Security Bureau, Xing Ting was awakened by the ringtone of his mobile phone. The sleepiness on his face instantly vanished shortly after he picked up the call and his expression turned a bit solemn before dialing Tang Xiu’s cell number.</p><p>“Hello. I’m Xing Ting, the City Public Security Bureau Chief. You said that you’re Tang Xiu from the Security Department, is that right?”</p><p>“That’s right,” answered Tang Xiu.</p><p>“This matter is too big, so please don’t jest, Mr. Tang. You should also be aware of the consequences if you deceive us,” said Xing Ting.</p><p>“I already told you that you can contact your superior if you don’t believe me,” replied Tang Xiu. “He should be able to get in touch with the people in my department. Also, you can contact someone from the Special Ability Bureau. I’m sure Duanmu Lin can confirm my identity as well.”</p><p>The Special Ability Bureau and Duanmu Lin?</p><p>Xing Ting’s face changed enormously and looked panicked. The City Public Security Bureau Chief was but an ordinary position, and he couldn’t have known the existence of Duanmu Lin at all. However, he was perfectly clear about this person since he had once been in contact with him during a major criminal case in the past. Only then did he learn that China had a Special Ability Bureau with ability users, and Duanmu Lin was the head of that agency.</p><p>“There’s no need for confirmation, Mr. Tang. Please tell me if you have any instructions for us. Our City Public Security Bureau will cooperate with you,” said Xing Ting with a respectful voice.</p><p>“I know that I have no jurisdiction over public law and order in Jingmen Island, but some people are now coming to disturb and bully me. He is said to be some kind of underworld kingpin in Jingmen Island. Hence, I decided to remove this trash at once. Bring your men to the Everlasting Feast Hall immediately to help me deal with the aftermath!” said Tang Xiu.</p><p>Xing Ting’s face turned black, for he didn’t expect for Tang Xiu to criticize Jingmen Island’s security problem. Never once it came to his mind that there were some bastards who were so ignorant and caused trouble for him now. Despite feeling helpless, he still replied respectfully, “I’ll take my men there right away, Mr. Tang. Do you mind disclosing who the responsible party is?”</p><p>“How many underground force leaders are there in Jingmen Island?” asked Tang Xiu back coldly.</p><p>“About this…”</p><p>Xing Ting forced a bitter smile. His police department was of course very clear of how many underground forces there were in Jingmen Island. It was numerous, at least a dozen of them. Nevertheless, although some of their shady and criminal activities were against the law, they hadn’t done anything that incited public wrath. Even though they committed crimes, they had always kept their activities in the dark and left no trace. That made it impossible for the police department to deal with them.</p><p>“Alright, seize the time and bring your men here! You’ll know who they are after you come.”</p><p>Xing Ting shook his head with a helpless face. After thinking about it for a moment, he immediately called the city leader to convey the situation. After the city leader heard Duanmu Lin’s name, he immediately decided to go over in person.</p><p>Back to the Everlasting Feast Hall, Tang Xiu waited for less than half an hour when more than a dozen cars rushed inside. Nobody stopped the convoy since the members of the Everlasting Feast Hall had received notification and orders in advance.</p><p><em>Creak…</em></p><p>As the sounds of brakes suddenly sounded, a lot of strong men with lethal weapons quickly came out of the cars with eyes threateningly glaring at Tang Xiu and his men. Guo Fugui came down from the car and stared dazedly as he saw Liu Hao’s group of four under the other party’s control. His expression immediately turned chilly as he walked towards Tang Xiu and the rest, asking in a grim voice, “Which one of you call the shots here?”</p><p>Tang Xiu opened his eyes and looked at him for a short while. Then, he let out a faint smile and said, “Ah, how fate works in a marvelous way. You should have lived a noble and rich life all this time, just like your name implies. But who would’ve thought that you would annoy me, making your fate take a sharp turn? It seems like your next destination is staying behind bars.”</p><p>” <em>Hmph</em> , so you are the one who calls the shots here, Brat!” said Guo Fugui contemptuously. “I, Guo Fugui, know no fear. Those who can make me stay behind bars aren’t yet born. Spit it out, where did your men hide Yang Yan?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
