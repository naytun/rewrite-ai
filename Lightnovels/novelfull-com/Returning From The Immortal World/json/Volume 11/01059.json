We haven’t yet found any particular kind of demonic beasts among them, but some are very strong. It should be over D-rank according to our standard measure of demonic beasts.”</p><p>Duanmu Lin gasped and said in surprise, “Our blockade line will fall if this tide of the demonic beasts has so many D-ranks. They can easily crush it.”</p><p>The classification for demonic beasts formulated by Duanmu Lin and numerous cultivators through the battles from low to high ranks were the comparison between demonic beasts with cultivators:</p><p>F-rank: ordinary demonic beast;</p><p>E-rank: demonic beast comparable to a Qi Refining Stage cultivator;</p><p>D-rank: demonic beast comparable to a Foundation Establishment Stage cultivator;</p><p>C-rank: demonic beast comparable to a Golden Core Stage cultivator;</p><p>B-rank: demonic beast comparable to a Nascent Soul Stage cultivator;</p><p>A-rank: demonic beast comparable to a Soul Formation Stage cultivator.</p><p>The ranks above are, respectively: S, SS, and SSS.</p><p>As of now, the most powerful demonic beasts that had already appeared were the ones with the size of a two-story building and were evaluated to be at B-rank.</p><p>Yet, such B-rank demonic beasts were on par with Nascent Soul Stage cultivators—a terrifying force that was enough to send a chill down the backs of Duanmu Lin and the other Chinese cultivators. However, no matter how dreadful it was to them, everyone was crystal clear that they must do everything they could to get rid of them, or the country would turn into a hellish pandemonium.</p><p>“Send a copy of our teams’ evaluation to Tang Xiu, Aquababe!” Duanmu Lin gave back the photos to Aquababe and issued an order with a serious face.</p><p>Aquababe nodded and sent the message to Tang Xiu. Then, she asked quickly, “What do we do next, Chief? If over 1,000 demonic beasts assemble, or more of them hit our blockade line, what should we do then? The armed forces guarding the blockade line are impossible to stop them.”</p><p>A chilling light flashed across Duanmu Lin’s eyes as he asked back, “Has General Wang Tao arrived yet?”</p><p>“He has arrived and is now deploying the military defensive measure on the periphery.” Aquababe nodded.</p><p>“Let’s go see him first,” said Duanmu Lin. “We must set up an armed defense system in Ugley first with all the weapons available. If worse comes to worst and we have no means left, our last step will be deploying weapons with enormous power.”</p><p>At the Himalayas.</p><p>Leading the juniors of the sect, Tang Xiu carefully observed the surrounding environment. The chilling wind whistled around the snow-capped mountains, and everyone could feel the piercing cold. To the astonishment of the 37 disciples of the Tang Sect, the speed of Tang 28’s group of five was not slower than them.</p><p>“We got a visual of around a dozen demonic beasts about 1300 meters away at 1 o’clock, and there are no other demonic beasts around them, although I don’t rule out the possibility that some could be hiding and out of the scope of my observations.”</p><p>Xue Sha, who was behind Tang Xiu, quickly reported with a changing expression.</p><p>Tang Xiu looked at the direction he pointed and instantly squinted his eyes. Then, he nodded. “Then let’s test the water by showing off some of our abilities since there are only a dozen demonic beasts. Gu Yin, you can also use the immortal sword your Senior Sister gave you.”</p><p>“I’ll definitely kill a lot of those demonic beasts, Master,” replied Gu Yin reverentially.</p><p>“Keep in mind that no matter how important killing the demonic beasts are, your safety still takes priority,” replied Tang Xiu with a smile. “There are still many chances available if you’re alive and you can kill many more demonic beasts later as long as you can guarantee your survival. Even if… the enemies are human.”</p><p>After getting along with the original members of the Everlasting Feast Hall for a long time, Gu Yin naturally learned a lot from them, that they used to carry out their missions. Thus, she was influenced by their lifestyle. She then gradually understood the cruelty of the world. Admittedly, she was very strong, and a bit much stronger, in fact. It was like she got afflicted by their disease and had her nerves tempered, becoming extremely tenacious. Therefore, she wouldn’t bat an eye as long as the opponent was an enemy.</p><p>Quickly after, the group approached those demonic beasts and were just 200 meters away from them. As the dozen demonic beasts finally noticed that some humans were approaching them, they howled and lunged toward them without hesitation.</p><p>“KILL!”</p><p>Tang Xiu didn’t use the divine sword but a two-meter long saber that emitted a dark, sinister aura. It was the saber he obtained from the small world in Kunlun mountain where the Diabolos Praecantator Clan were prisoned. It was one of the tens of millions of divine armaments he obtained there.</p><p>The blade qi was as though a rainbow with overwhelming momentum.</p><p>The two demonic beasts in the forefront with sharp spikes all over their bodies were instantly split into two halves by the saber. The violent blade qi was such that it frightened the rest of demonic beasts and they avoided it. At this moment, more than 40 experts at the Foundation Establishment Stage, including Tang 28, also began their violent assault.</p><p><em>Puff…</em></p><p>A demonic beast that was trying to avoid the blade qi was pierced by Gu Yin’s sword. Due to using too much power, her immortal sword basically ripped its abdomen and scattered its internal organs.</p><p>“Killing them is easy!”</p><p>She neither had any discomfort nor disturbed thoughts though it was her first killing, and she even looked a bit stimulated instead. She nodded contentedly as she pulled the immortal sword from the beast.</p><p>“Be careful!”</p><p>Xue Sha, who always followed Gu Yin, noticed that the shredded demonic beasts hadn’t died yet. Its claws were sweeping lightning-fast to claw Gu Yin. An immortal sword then quickly slashed forward and cut off its two sharp claws directly. As the claws fell, the sword chopped its head and solved the crisis that would’ve befallen upon Gu Yin.</p><p><em>Huff…</em></p><p>The sudden danger that nearly threatened her life made Gu Yin feel a chill and become frightened. She never thought that a demonic beast that had been injured to such an extent would turn out to be so tenacious. Not only had it not died directly, it even counterattacked instead. She could feel that she was just a hair away from getting snatched by the Grim Reaper. If Xue Sha hadn’t acted in time, she would’ve been dead or disabled now.</p><p>“Just be careful, alright!”</p><p>Xue Sha couldn’t help but sigh inwardly. He kicked the demonic beast’s body afterward and called out.</p><p>Gu Yin hurriedly nodded and gratefully looked at Xue Sha, saying, “Thank you, Uncle Xue Sha. I would’ve been killed by that demonic beast if it wasn’t for your timely rescue.”</p><p>“We’re family, and you’re also Sect Master’s disciple. Even if you’re ready to go all out and disregard your life, I’ll keep protecting your safety,” said Xue Sha. “But you must remember that the situation on the battlefield is ever-changing. I fear that sometime I’ll be too late to save you. Hence, you must keep your safety a top priority whenever you fight. Don’t ever be careless and treat it lightly.”</p><p>“Umm.” Gu Yin hurriedly nodded and her expression turned particularly serious.</p><p>After Tang Xiu killed the previous two demonic beasts, he didn’t keep attacking as he thought that this was the best chance to hone the Tang Sect’s disciples. He wanted all the disciples to have rich combat experience so that their chances of survival would be better in the future.</p><p>“Huh?”</p><p>Suddenly, his face slightly shifted. It was due to the demonic beast’s dead body that was kicked by Xue Sha that had fallen nearby. He could see a black crystal coming out of its wound along with its internal organs.</p><p>“What is this?”</p><p>Tang Xiu’s thoughts moved and the black crystal was pulled into his hand. Suddenly, his pupils shrank and contracted as disbelief and incredulity filled his eyes and face.</p><p><em>How could such a low-rank demonic beast actually have a Demon Core?</em></p><p>It must be noted that he had traveled to the Demon Realm several times in the past, where he carried out massacres and killed literally millions of demonic beasts there. Such Demon Cores only existed in the body of high-rank demonic beasts, but the weakest of those high-rank demonic beasts had the strength of an Immortal Stage cultivator.</p><p>Shortly after, he quickly dissected several other demonic beasts nearby and found several Demon Cores from their insides. While holding these Demon Cores, he tried to absorb the demonic force contained within. To his surprise, the essences of the demonic force in them were especially rich. Even the demonic energy from ten Demon Stones was not as rich as the energy from one Demon Core.</p><p>“This is great!”</p><p>With a heart full of joy, Tang Xiu glanced around and found that there were only four or five demonic beasts left still struggling to fight back. His figure flashed and the saber turned into a saber light that directly killed them.</p><p>“Dissect their bodies and see if they have Demon Cores in them!”</p><p>Upon hearing his order, several disciples of the Tang Sect immediately dissected the demonic beasts’ corpses as per Tang Xiu’s instructions. They also successfully found a Demon Core in each of their bodies.</p><p><em>’13 demonic beasts yielded 13 Demon Cores. It means that every demonic beast has its own Demon Core. This is really a fortune! The number of demonic beasts in this mountain range must be in the tens of thousands. If I can secure all the Demon Cores from their bodies, that would be like getting myself a buried treasure! I won’t be short on resources for my own cultivation before I reach the Immortal Stage.’</em></p><p>Tang Xiu’s eyes were particularly bright at his moment. His eyes swept over the demonic beasts’ bodies before taking out his communicator to call Duanmu Lin. After typing a message, he separately texted it to Mo Awu, Jin Shi, Ye Shisan, and Hao Lei: “There’s a black crystal in the body of each demonic beast. Dissect all demonic beasts and dig out their Demon Cores!”</p><p>Shortly after, he dialed Duanmu Lin’s communicator number.</p><p>“What’s up, Tang Xiu?” Duanmu Lin’s voice came out from the communicator.</p><p>“Can we discuss something, Senior Duanmu?” asked Tang Xiu.</p><p>“Yeah, what is it?” asked Duanmu Lin with a curious voice.</p><p>“Sell all the demonic beasts’ bodies killed by the others to me,” said Tang Xiu. “I don’t care about the price since I need the bodies of these demonic beasts to collect the materials I can use for cultivation in the future.”</p><p>“Ehh? There are materials useful for cultivators in the bodies of these demonic beasts?” asked Duanmu Lin, still curious.</p><p>“The materials in their bodies have no effect on normal cultivators, but it does on me,” answered Tang Xiu. “If I can get a lot of demonic beasts’ corpses, my cultivation will greatly improve and progress faster.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
