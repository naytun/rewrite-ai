But he was still puzzled since he couldn’t find anything particular that made this boy marvelous even though he had an excellent physique. Yet, this boy had literally jumped from a precarious child to a cultivator at the mid-stage of Foundation Establishment. All things considered, his advancement speed was too fast.</p><p>“Tell me, is there something special about your daily practice?”</p><p>“Nothing?” said 28. “I just follow the cultivation methods taught by the instructors and keep circulating my True Essence in my body every day. I have no idea why my cultivation is faster than everyone else.”</p><p>“Ehh? Just that?” Tang Xiu felt more bizarre inwardly.</p><p>Tang Xiu shook his head secretly. Just as he was about to speak again, his complexion shifted and a look of disbelief covered his eyes as he hurriedly asked, “You just said that you’ve been constantly circulating True Essence in your body every day? You haven’t ceased doing it once?”</p><p>“Yeah! Isn’t cultivation carried out like this?” 28 nodded.</p><p>Tang Xiu grabbed 28’s wrist once again. He used his spiritual sense to seep into his body and ultimately discovered this boy’s particularity. His meridians were very wide, but the most shocking thing was that 28’s meridians were somewhat abnormal compared to average people. His meridians’ walls were very tough and elastic, while there were also microscopic blood spots on its surface.</p><p>Isn’t this Sanguine Meridians? He actually has Sanguine Meridians!</p><p>The discovery made Tang Xiu speechless for a long while. Back when in the Immortal World, he once read the records from a secret ancient collection. It was said that there had been a peerless genius with Sanguine Meridian Physique in the Immortal World hundreds of thousands of years ago. This genius only spent a little over two millenniums to reach the Perfected Golden Immortal Stage. Unfortunately, he died halfway and met his demise under the hands of a certain Supreme. Otherwise, he would’ve advanced to the Supremacy Stage in just another millennium given his potential. That secret record even stated that if this peerless genius didn’t die prematurely, he was the most promising one to ascend to divinity at that time.</p><p>And yet, another cultivation genius with the Sanguine Meridians Physique was present before him? What was more incredible was… why did he appear on Earth?</p><p>“Boss, I…”</p><p>28 couldn’t understand why Tang Xiu kept holding his wrist. However, he didn’t feel any malice from Tang Xiu either. Ever since he was found in the rubbish heap a year ago and then sent to Shanghai, he saw Tang Xiu the Boss there. Yet, he couldn’t figure out why Tang Xiu wanted to adopt him and so many other children. Tang Xiu was the one who provided him the daily necessities he needed. And the most important thing was that he also sent people to teach them a cultivation art—the very reason why he had formidable power now.</p><p>It was that the reason why those children regarded Tang Xiu as their Boss on the surface, yet saw him as their relative—the closest one; a similar feeling he also had. Just like the other children, he was willing to be loyal to Tang Xiu just to pay him back for everything.</p><p>Tang Xiu raised his hand to interrupt the boy. After loosening his hand, he asked seriously, “28, would you like me to give you a family name?”</p><p>A family name? For me? 28’s eyes lit up as he nodded and said, “I’d like to have it.”</p><p>“If so, then your name is Tang 28 from now on,” said Tang Xiu.</p><p>Joy and excitement set ablaze in 28’s heart. He knew that the Boss had bestowed his surname to some children among all the children he had been training with. Just like those five who were named after the five elements; metal, wood, water, fire, and earth. They were separately called Tang Jin, Tang Mu, Tang Shui, Tang Huo, and Tang Tu. He also had the same surname as Boss, which was Tang.</p><p>“Yeah. Then, I’ll bear the name Tang 28.”</p><p>With a satisfied face, Tang Xiu nodded. “Tang 28, do you want to stand out among others, like having higher cultivation and more powerful strength in the future?”</p><p>“I think so. Only by becoming stronger can I have enough food, a place to live, clothes to wear. I can also protect you, Boss,” said Tang 28 aloud.</p><p>A smile crept up on Tang Xiu’s face while secretly admiring the brainwashing methods of those instructors. It had been just a year, yet these children had engraved his figure in their hearts.</p><p>“Alright, Tang 28. From henceforth, you’ll leave the training camp and become the Shadow of I, Tang Xiu! I’ll give you the authority to pick four partners from the training camp to be in your team. They must be ready to be dispatched at any time for assignments. Go now! I want you to bring your chosen companions in a few days. You all are to stay here and wait for my return.”</p><p>Tang 28 firmly nodded and said, “I’ll be waiting for you with the others, Boss.”</p><p>“Ah, remember to not call me Boss again. Call me Sect Master from now on,” said Tang Xiu. “I’ll send someone to record your name in the Tang Sect’s registry record as you’re now the new disciple of Tang Sect.”</p><p>“Tang Sect?” Secretly, Tang 28 silently engraved this name in his heart after nodding.</p><p>****</p><p>Shortly after, two helicopters’ roars were heard as they flew toward the ninth deserted island. After an hour-plus flight, they landed on the ninth deserted island. A few people had been stationed there. The number was but a few, just a little over 20 people.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>Figures flickered and emerged out from the helicopters’ cabin lightning-fast and landed on the ninth deserted island. Among those in the group who had long been waiting were Old Anji and Chen Yan and most of them were the former dangerous convicts Tang Xiu rescued from the 1319 labor camp. Few of them were former members of the Everlasting Feast Hall.</p><p>“Boss!”</p><p>A chilling aura emanated from the men standing in an orderly formation. As the men saw Tang Xiu’s arrival, they loudly shouted, greeting him with a frenetic excitement.</p><p>Looking at these people stand in a neat row before him, Tang Xiu felt satisfied inwardly. Especially towards the nearly 20 heavy criminals he had rescued from the 1319 labor camp. They looked like they had just been reborn and lost their former brash and sloppy personality. The auras emanating from their bodies gave off the vibe of an iron-blooded warrior.</p><p>“Have you been well, everyone?” Tang Xiu looked at them and finally nodded. “It’s been several months, but you guys truly surprised me. Each of you now has the threshold of becoming a cultivator with—experts at the Qi Refining Stage. Tell me, do you regret your choice?”</p><p>“NO REGRET!!!”</p><p>More than 20 people replied in unison.</p><p>“Great!” Tang Xiu nodded and said, “Since you don’t regret it, then I hope you won’t regret what you are about to face next. We’ll soon be facing other powerhouses of the world’s major forces, many of whom are the experts among the experts. Some even comparable to the Golden Core Stage experts. But all of you will participate in this fight. Now I ask you, are you afraid of them?”</p><p>“NEVER!”</p><p>The group shouted again.</p><p>“Good.” Tang Xiu nodded. “Since you’re not afraid, then take your time to practice and be prepared for battle! Any of you who scores great merits in the upcoming battle can join the Tang Sect when you’ve advanced to the Foundation Establishment Stage. I think you’ve heard the name of Tang Sect in the last two days, right?”</p><p>“That’s great!”</p><p>“I’ve heard about it.”</p><p>“It’s an opportunity.”</p><p>More than 20 people looked surprised and happy with burning eyes filled with battle spirit. Becoming a disciple of the Tang Sect was a must for them to be stronger and go further. It was an issue they had figured out in these two days. As long as they became Tang Sect’s disciples, they would be able to get more cultivation resources and study more advanced cultivation art manuals to master more abilities.</p><p>All in all, it was an opportunity that would make them like carps that leaped through the dragon gate. As long as they earned great merits and advanced to the Foundation Establishment Stage, it was equal to moving towards their own success.</p><p>“Alright, everyone. I still have things to do. Go to tend to your own,” concluded Tang Xiu.</p><p>Shortly after, Tang Xiu spent a lot of materials to arrange the array that covered the whole ninth deserted island. Besides the island’s protective array, he even laid out the illusion array that would make anyone who broke the protective array to bump into an illusion and enter the illusory world.</p><p>The Ninth Dragon Island was planned to be a substitute for Nine Dragons Island. It was set to be exposed as the vault of the rumored treasures for the major forces who were searching for it, and would also serve as the main battlefield. After arranging the array, Tang Xiu didn’t hurry to leave but sent orders to dispatch a large number of peripheral members to participate in the upcoming battle.</p><p>“What date is today, Awen?” asked Tang Xiu suddenly as he stood on the coastline of the ninth island.</p><p>“It’s September 4th, Sect Master,” replied Mo Awen.</p><p>September 4th?</p><p>Tang Xiu was stunned and looked dull as a wry smile appeared on his face. It was the date the Shanghai University began schooling. Just like his first year, he also skipped classes on the first day of his sophomore year now.</p><p>Haih, I must go back as soon as possible…</p><p>Tang Xiu then recalled the Violet Fairy in his interspatial ring and the thought led to Han Qingwu. He had been thinking to use this Violet Fairy to confirm something with her, which the result was something he was very concerned about.</p><p>Whoosh…</p><p>A shadow flashed from the distant sea and stood in front of Tang Xiu and Mo Awen in a flash. It was Spectre.</p><p>“I got a situation to report, Boss.”</p><p>“What is it?” asked Tang Xiu.</p><p>“There has been a liner sailing around the nearby waters recently, but what made us surprised is that there’s no passenger on it on the outside,” said Spectre. “Then, I sneaked inside. I only found a dozen crew members inside. I also asked the crew members, but they said that there’s only one passenger on the liner who chartered the ship to sail here. But the strange thing is that we didn’t find any of her traces when looked for her.”</p><p>“You didn’t ask who she is?” Tang Xiu frowned.</p><p>“I only know that the person is a woman around her 20s.” Spectre forced a smile and said, “She is said to wear black robes and a mask, so the crew members don’t know what she looks like. Ah, that’s right. They said she’s good at music since they heard her playing several instruments while they were sailing on the sea. The music she played was very pleasant to hear, they say.”</p><p>Skilled in music?</p><p>Tang Xiu’s face slightly changed and he suddenly recalled the incident that happened in Bangkok when they fought the Death Dhyana Buddhist Master. An expert who was proficient in music appeared in the dark and yet didn’t show up. He also sent some men to find her, but couldn’t find her traces.</p><p>Could it be… the mysterious woman in that liner is the same person who helped out in Bangkok? If not, who else could the mysterious figure be? But if she’s the same person, who exactly is she? Why would she always come and go like a shadow and stalk me wherever I go?</p><p>“Where is this liner now?” asked Tang Xiu with a deep voice.</p><p>“It’s about 100 nautical miles from this island,” said Spectre. “However, the ship has been sailing around in the nearby waters without a fixed destination. I reckon that it’s time for it to sail back.”</p><p>“Take me to the last spot you found that ship!” said Tang Xiu with a deep voice. “I really want to know who this mysterious stalker is.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
