Both of them wore similarly strange expressions and looked at Tang Xiu with inquisitive eyes.</p><p>“You guessed it right, guys. That’s that Fire Qilin,” whispered Tang Xiu. “It’s just I never thought this guy was so powerful. It didn’t seem it wanted to kill us then, else we’d have died in its hand no matter how fast we ran.”</p><p>“Well, could it be that the natural array outside the underground labyrinth was broken?” asked Miao Wentang in a whisper. “How could it come out, then?”</p><p>“My guess is that natural array didn’t trap it, but instead has been used by this thing to block outsiders from entering the underground space to enter its nest,” answered Tang Xiu. “However, although its strength is powerful, it is just on par with that demonic beast and even slightly weaker.”</p><p>Miao Wentang’s complexion changed and he hurriedly asked, “Then what should we do? That Fire Qilin suddenly appeared here. It’s like our savior, you know. If it can’t slay that dreadful demonic beast, we’re as good as dead already!”</p><p>Tang Xiu fell into silence for a while. Then, he suddenly looked at Han Qingwu and said in a deep voice, “If you don’t wanna die, join me in helping that Fire Qilin. We can only survive by killing that demonic beast.”</p><p>“I’ll do whatever you tell me to do.” Han Qingwu directly nodded.</p><p>Brows slightly scrunched up, Tang Xiu immediately sat cross-legged and arranged the Spiritual Energy Gathering Array with 36 Demon Cores. He then began to communicate with the stars in the universe and frantically absorbed astral power.</p><p>The fight between the Fire Qilin and Bloodfiend Monarch could only be said as dreadful. Their battlefield started at the blockade line to the depths of the Himalayas. Cultivators with weak cultivation levels were simply unable to judge which one was stronger or weaker. However, what made them rejoice was that the Fire Qilin came right at the time the crisis was going to befall upon them, for they knew that they would’ve died already otherwise.</p><p><em>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</em></p><p>Four figures flickered lightning-fast from the distance. As they appeared in the blink of an eye around Tang Xiu’s spot, Tang An’s figure then emerged before she disappeared, while Tang Guan, Chi Nan, and Kuwako quickly looked at Tang Xiu.</p><p>“What happened to Grand Master, Mo Awu?!”</p><p>Tang Guang immediately asked while looking at Tang Xiu, who was covered in blood and sitting cross-legged.</p><p>“Sovereign used an array to kill tens of thousands of demonic beasts, but it made him seriously injured,” answered Mo Awu. “He’s now seizing the time to heal and restore his power.”</p><p>“But he doesn’t have any other major problem, right?” asked Tang Guang hurriedly.</p><p>“There shouldn’t be any.” Mo Awu shook his head and said, “Sect Master will be back to his prime condition as long as there’s more time.”</p><p>The rest around Tang Guang secretly let out a sigh of relief after hearing it.</p><p>At this moment, Duanmu Lin dashed towards Tang Xiu. He had discovered that tens of thousands of demonic beasts were quickly advancing towards them.</p><p><em>Whoosh!</em></p><p>Xue Yu then appeared out of nowhere and blocked Duanmu Lin’s path as she said faintly, “Senior Duanmu, Tang Xiu is currently recuperating, so please don’t bother him!”</p><p>Her emergence shocked Duanmu Lin. She literally appeared like a ghost! After halting his pace, he calmly observed her and then immediately asked in surprise, “How… did you become this powerful? Shouldn’t you… ah… don’t tell me Tang Xiu also taught you some skills?”</p><p>“How I became this powerful is not your business, is it, Senior Duanmu?” replied Xue Yu faintly. “If the news is correct, you should be the commander in this operation to fight these demonic beasts, yes? Now that we’re fighting the horde of demonic beasts, don’t you just need to fight them?”</p><p>“We got too many demonic beasts, that’s why.” Duanmu Lin forced a smile and said, “Tang Xiu killed tens of thousands of them, but we can’t face them with the overall strength of the human cultivators. That’s why I came here quickly. I just wanna ask whether Tang Xiu can arrange another array to aid us in killing them.”</p><p>“As I said, he’s recuperating now, so I don’t care about any of your problems.” Xue Yu shook her head and said, “Please wait until he himself comes to see you.”</p><p>“But this…”</p><p>Duanmu Lin hesitated for a moment. But he finally sighed before turning around and leaving.</p><p>Xue Yu paced forward and came flying to Tang Xiu’s side. She then took out an exquisite jade box from her interspatial ring, put it in front of Tang Xiu, then softly said while standing, “Sis Yan’er gave me this Essence Soul Condensing Pill. She said it would be helpful to you.”</p><p>Tang Xiu opened his eyes and felt ecstatic inwardly. The Essence Soul Condensing Pill was a great elixir even in the Immortal World. Not only did it have a great effect on improving one’s spiritual sense with the cultivation below the Immortal Stage, but taking it could also make one advance directly and greatly increase their strength rapidly.</p><p>“This came in the time of need, indeed!”</p><p>He opened the jade box and quickly took out the pill from the inside. After taking it, he shut his eyes and absorbed it to refine the efficacy.</p><p>After 10 minutes, he woke up from his cultivation once again. After opening his eyes, he saw the Bloodfiend Monarch bombarding the Fire Qilin’s huge body, sending it to fly upside down. While Duanmu Lin and thousands of human cultivators were in an intense fight with demonic beasts on the ground. Fortunately, disciples of Tang Sect were forming a sword formation and constantly resisting the attacks of demonic beasts. Their efforts prevented the rest of human cultivators to retreat and didn’t become the slaughter feast of those demonic beasts.</p><p>“Xue Yu, Han Qingwu, you both will come with me to help that Fire Qilin. The rest of you, go slay those demonic beasts. But do pay attention to those demonic beasts at the Spirit Formation and Nascent Soul Stages!”</p><p><em>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</em></p><p>Three figures flew toward Bloodfiend Monarch. Tang Xiu was quite lucky after taking the Essence Soul Condensing Pill. Not only had he recovered from his injuries, but his spiritual sense had also greatly improved and he also made a breakthrough in his cultivation, advancing to the third level of Stars Heavenly Essence Stage. The only thing that puzzled him was that he hadn’t yet obtained any divine abilities to cast astral power whatsoever even though he had advanced to the third level.</p><p>“To the Nascent Soul Stage Seniors, please help the rest to slay those demonic beasts! Awu, you also join them!” Tang Xiu shouted the moment he attacked the Bloodfiend Monarch.</p><p>“KILL!”</p><p>“KILL!!”</p><p>The chaotic battle ensued and everyone was fighting at close quarters. The flowing blood created streams and the ground was littered with corpses. The horrifying sight would’ve made the average people be scared to death should they witness it.</p><p>As Tang Xiu saw Han Qingwu and Xue Yu fly to attack Bloodfiend Monarch, he swept his hand and rushed towards a snowy peak in the blink of an eye. He instantly sent a wave of qi to wrap the Fire Qilin and pulled it up from above.</p><p>“I’d like to thank you for not killing me then, Fire Qilin. That particular demonic beast is very terrible. I’m afraid you’re not its opponent if you fight it by yourself. Let’s team up to slay it and get rid of this disaster,” said Tang Xiu aloud.</p><p>The Fire Qilin itself seemed to recognize Tang Xiu. It let out a cold snort and directly transmitted its thought to Tang Xiu using spiritual sense: “You snatched quite a lot of things from me then, brat! I don’t want you to return them now, but I want half of the Demon Cores from these damn demonic beasts!”</p><p>“Uh, Demon Cores are too important for me now, Fire Qilin.” Tang Xiu retorted. “Half of them is too much. How about one-fifth? I’ll give you a fifth of Demon Cores to make up from my previous deeds, okay?”</p><p>“Nope. A third!” The Fire Qilin haggled.</p><p>Tang Xiu was silent for a moment. Then, he gritted his teeth and said, “Fine! I’ll give you a third of the Demon Cores. But you must answer a question. How do you know that each of those demonic beasts has a Demon Core? And what do you wanna do with them?”</p><p>“I used to be an Immortal Beast in the Immortal World, so I naturally know that these demonic beasts have Demon Cores,” answered Fire Qilin. “If anything, Earth has no Immortal Stone, nor even any piece of energy crystal. I want to arrange an array to go back to the Immortal World, and I’m short of useful things for that. Those Demon Cores can replace Immortal Stones.”</p><p>“You can arrange an array to return to the Immortal World from Earth?” asked Tang Xiu in amazement.</p><p>The Fire Qilin nodded. But then it shook its head shortly after. It sent its thought to Tang Xiu’s mind once again: “There’s a Spatial Array on Earth, but it’s damaged, so I need to patch it. However, it’s been so many years, so I have no idea if it can be repaired.”</p><p>An ecstatic look flashed on Tang Xiu’s face. He then said in a deep tone, “I’ll help you repair that Spatial Teleportation Array later. Rest assured, I’m quite an expert in arrays myself. Only a few immortals in the Immortal World are better than me in this aspect. Alright, let’s spare the talk and let’s join forces to kill those demonic beasts, shall we?”</p><p>The Fire Qilin didn’t hesitate and flung itself towards the Bloodfiend Monarch. However, it sent its thought again to Tang Xiu’s mind: “You can’t kill this thing, you can only seal it. This demonic beast is very strong, it isn’t just as simple as being at the Body Integration Stage. If my guess is correct, this guy is in the same situation as me and his actual cultivation should’ve reached the Perfected Golden Immortal Stage.”</p><p><em>Hiss…</em></p><p>Tang Xiu gasped in cold air. If the Fire Qilin was correct, then it would be very difficult to kill it.</p><p>“But this guy is a disaster, so we have no choice but to slay it, Fire Qilin. But rest assured, though! I have the means to slay it if we can injure it heavily!” Tang Xiu transmitted his answer to the Fire Qilin right as he was about to sprint towards the Bloodfiend Monarch.</p><p>“Great!”</p><p>The Fire Qilin didn’t speak anymore and unleashed various kinds of divine abilities. It teamed up with Tang Xiu, Han Qingwu, and Xue Yu to mount heavy strikes against Bloodfiend Monarch. Although Tang Xiu had just broken through again and now was barely on par with an early-stage Spirit Formation cultivator, the combined power of him, Han Qingwu, and Xue Yue was still slightly weaker.</p><p>However, with the addition of these three, Bloodfiend Monarch was immediately suppressed. While that particular Spirit Formation Stage demonic beast wanting to help the latter, it was getting entangled and pestered by the three Nascent Soul Stage human experts.</p><p>Time fleeted by and Bloodfiend Monarch was badly battered after two hours. Its aura was getting weaker by the seconds. Tang Xiu, Han Qingwu, and Xue Yu themselves had consumed most of their powers and their True Essence energy would likely be unable to last much longer.</p><p>“Han Qingwu, use Zither Melody of Heavenly Demon!”</p><p>Just as Tang Xiu dodged a fierce blow from Bloodfiend Monarch, he immediately fell back and instantly appeared next to Han Qingwu.</p><p>The latter complied, The moment the Fire Qilin and Xue Yu attacked Bloodfiend Monarch once again, she suddenly retreated some kilometers away and directly played her zither in mid-air. She owed Tang Xiu a great deal in the past and kept loving him until the present, which led her to be very obedient</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
