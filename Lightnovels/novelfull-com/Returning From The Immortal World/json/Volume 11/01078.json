Yet this kid went so far as to brazenly brag without batting an eye. That was really disgusting.</p><p>“Guan Le!” The middle-aged Taoist nun slightly furrowed her brows and called out with dissatisfaction.</p><p>“Everyone, let’s spare ourselves the nonsensical shits spit out by this brat and just rush straight into the depths of the mountain range.” The burly man sneered. “Even if there’s a demonic beast on par with Spirit Formation Stage experts, four of us can join hands to kill it!”</p><p>The young man in white nodded and agreed. “Guan Le is right. Tricks are futile in the face of absolute strength. Let’s not waste time since we’re going to hunt and kill demonic beasts, to begin with. After killing the powerful ones, we can give the minor ones to the rest of the people here.”</p><p>“My thoughts exactly,” echoed the amiable-looking old man.</p><p>The middle-aged Taoist nun, however, slightly furrowed her brows and looked hesitant. She knew more about Tang Xiu and would rather believe his words. However, she also agreed with her three old friends since they were ready to enter the mountain range to hunt and kill the strongest demonic beasts. She felt that even if they were unable to kill the most powerful demonic beasts in the mountains, they would be fine since they were also able to escape.</p><p>“Ancestress!” called out Daoist Zixuan hurriedly.</p><p>“You don’t need to persuade me, Little Zixuan.” The Taoist nun waved and smilingly said, “They want to go to the mountains directly to kill the strongest demonic beasts, so I naturally can’t ignore them. Maybe the current crisis will be resolved faster by following them.”</p><p>Upon hearing it, Daoist Zixuan immediately looked helpless and said, “Then I’ll speak no longer since you’ve made up your mind, Ancestress. But there’s something I’d like you to have.”</p><p>Having said that, she handed the interspatial bracelet to the middle-aged Taoist nun. Stored inside was not only the cultivation manual traded from Tang Xiu but also the immortal sword.</p><p>As the Taoist nun received the interspatial bracelet, she released her perception to sense it and immediately found a divine sword. It shocked her inwardly since she could feel the terrifying aura exuding from it. Turbulence waves surged in her heart as it made her more confident in hunting the demonic beasts in the mountain range.</p><p>“Let’s set off!”</p><p>The red-faced Guan Le soared and flew towards the depths of the mountains.</p><p>In just a few seconds, the newly arrived four Nascent Soul Stage human experts had directly entered the depths of the Himalayas to start the hunt. Tang Xiu himself quickly nodded to Duanmu Lin and also gestured for Hao Lei and some others to follow them behind silently.</p><p>With the current situation, every human expert was comrade-in-arms, and these four Nascent Soul Stage experts were the strongest existences of humanity. If they were to fall in the Himalayas due to their arrogance, it was something that Tang Xiu couldn’t accept.</p><p>Deep in the Himalayas, savage demonic beasts had literally covered the snowy ground as the chilling wind howled, adding chill and terror to the suppressing aura of nearly 100,000 demonic beasts. Two super demonic beasts the size of a building were slowly coming out of a wide grotto and the horde roared yet again.</p><p>“SILENCE!”</p><p>An afterimage flashed and Archfiend Rupture appeared in front of two huge demonic beasts. Its blood-red eyes swept underneath as it shouted while unleashing its savage aura.</p><p>In but a flash, everything went deathly still and all the demonic beasts looked at Archfiend Rupture with fear, waiting for orders.</p><p>Archfiend Rupture raised its head and roared a few times. Then, it spoke in demonic beasts’ language, “Our Great King, Bloodfiend Monarch has finally woken up and we will soon occupy this planet. For thousands of years, we have been drifting and trapped in this forsaken small planet and damned iceberg. No way in hell will we be reconciled with this, and neither will our Great Bloodfiend Monarch. Therefore, we will slaughter all the humans on this planet and occupy this place. Let us use this planet as a springboard to blaze our way back to the Demon Realm, to kill our enemies and reclaim our domains!”</p><p>“KILL!”</p><p>“KILL! KILL!”</p><p>“KIL! KILL! KILL!”</p><p>Nearly 100,000 demonic beasts roared and screamed. Under the leadership of Archfiend Rupture and two ten-meter high demonic beasts, all of them roared and dashed to the south.</p><p>In mid-air, four Nascent Soul Stage experts stopped moving and stood still, staring dumbly at the flying demonic beasts in front. They couldn’t help but gasp with a chill running down their backs upon seeing the flying demonic beasts completely shrouding the sky. They could also sense the suppressing momentum and aura released by the horde of demonic beasts. Despite evaluating themselves as very powerful experts, it was a sight that shocked them to the core.</p><p>“DIE, HUMANS!”</p><p>The two ten meters high demonic beasts flew forward and fiercely attacked the four Nascent Soul Stage experts without hesitation.</p><p>Archfiend Rupture didn’t rush to attack and just watched the four humans calmly, yet the killing intent in its heart was seething. He was rather furious to see that these humans dared to enter the depths of the Himalayas.</p><p>BANG… BANG… BANG…</p><p>“KILL…”</p><p>The two huge demonic beasts fought fiercely with the four Nascent Soul Stage experts, and the latter quickly fell into a disadvantage.</p><p>Upon seeing this, Archfiend Rupture hesitated no longer. He howled and charged into the fray mid-air. Its movement was even faster than the two huge demonic beasts. A black vortex instantly appeared and a dark chain suddenly flew out from it.</p><p>BANG… BANG…</p><p>The youth in white was caught off guard and was slammed by the black chain on his chest and crazily coughed up a mouthful of blood. His body was like a broken kite as he flew backward. Even though the other three were able to avoid the danger, they still struggled against the sucking force from the black vortex, unable to rescue the youth in white.</p><p>“Heh, so fragile.”</p><p>Archfiend Rupture laughed wildly and howled. Joining hands with the other two demonic beasts, a crisis immediately loomed over the four Nascent Soul Stage experts.</p><p>“Immortal Slayer Chain—KILL!”</p><p>The black chain with the black vortex was the supernatural abilities possessed by Archfiend Rupture. Added with his own strength that was on par with Spirit Formation Stage experts, he didn’t give the youth in white any chance to escape. Dozen black chains were shot at him and tightly wrapped the youth in white, pulling him into the black vortex.</p><p>Suddenly, a black figure bolted from the distance lightning-fast and a 100-meter sword light was shot from a divine sword, smashing toward the black chain flying in the air. Violent energy blasted and formed a tornado that clashed with the black vortex that sucked they young man in white.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The black chain shattered while the black vortex was disrupted by the tornado. It rapidly dissipated and finally disappeared. The young man in white was ghastly pale and escaped in distress. However, another black chain was shot again at his back.</p><p>“BREAK!!!”</p><p>Tang Xiu’s aura surged and a brilliant light radiated from the divine sword. The flow of energy then wrapped the young man in white as Tang Xiu immediately pulled him back before turning and running back.</p><p>“What are you guys waiting for? Run quickly!”</p><p>At this moment, the Taoist nun, the amiable-looking old man, and the red-faced Guan Le, who were just shocked by the sudden crisis, finally realized that they were simply no match for these demonic beasts at all. They turned around and quickly chased Tang Xiu’s figure toward the outside of the mountain range.</p><p>“Hammer of Death!”</p><p>“Death God Scythe!”</p><p>The other two demonic beasts with the strength of the late-stage of the Nascent Soul Stage unleashed their magic abilities at the same time. Even though the middle-aged Taoist nun, the old man, and Guan Le were fleeing very fast, the giant hammer and black crescent saber struck them heavy wounds.</p><p>Quickly after, the five of them had fled to the blockade line. Tang Xiu then threw the nearly injured young man in white to Mo Awu and shouted, “Prepare for battle! We got tons of demonic beasts coming, at least nearly 90,000 of them! Remember my instruction and immediately activate the arrays!”</p><p>14 figures quickly rushed and activated the geomancy array and stood at its center.</p><p>Guan Le moved and appeared at the side of the young man in white. His expression was extremely ugly. At this moment, he had to admit that he was truly arrogant for suggesting to intrude into the depths of the mountain range proactively. That demonic beast truly had the power of the Spirit Formation Stage. It was too powerful, while there were also two others who had Nascent Soul Stage power. Just those three demonic beasts joining hands were not a force the four Nascent Soul Stage experts could fight against.</p><p>“Now is not the time to blame yourself. Take out your weapon and prepare for battle! Today, we or those demonic beasts must perish.” Tang Xiu appeared at Guan Le’s side and growled.</p><p>Guan Le raised his head to look at Tang Xiu’s solemn face. Grief and indignation filled his heart since he looked down on Tang Xiu prior to this that he didn’t even bother to give him due respect. He thought that Tang Xiu was just a brat who dared to brag in front of them. However, after having gone through the crisis just now, he realized that Tang Xiu was by no means weak. Be it his speed or explosive killing moves, they must have surpassed him.</p><p>“I apologize for the previous issue, Daoist Tang.”</p><p>Guan Le couldn’t help but feel grateful to Tang Xiu. If it wasn’t for his help at their direst moment before, his companion—the young man in white—would’ve died to those demonic beasts.</p><p>“No need to apologize.” Tang Xiu shook his head and said, “If you feel guilty, just kill more demonic beasts! We mustn’t harbor any more feelings of animosity, however. I have a bad premonition that we will face more dangerous things soon.”</p><p>Guan Le took a deep breath and floated up. Just as he was about to rush into the invisible array, Tang Xiu immediately blocked him. “Don’t rush to go into action! I’ve arranged an array in the surrounding. You can act and slaughter those demonic beasts after we kill as many as possible with these arrays!”</p><p>An array? Use an array to kill demonic beasts?</p><p>Guan Le didn’t understand about arrays, though he knew their might. Suddenly, the way he looked at Tang Xiu was completely different from before.</p><p>“KILL!”</p><p>The overwhelming horde of demonic beasts quickly rushed into the array in front of the blockade line. In that instant, the 14 cultivators with meager cultivation level who had learned to operate the array from Tang Xiu began to manipulate it to kill the rushing demonic beasts.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
