It was something he had long been craving to obtain. He felt this energy shield would be essential if it was used by the military. For example, if two armies were fighting and their side was protected by this energy shield, they could definitely avoid a lot of casualties.</p><p>And yet… such a kind of advanced technology was used on this trivial Aeroglider?! That was simply wasting an excellent resource!</p><p>Duanmu Lin turned to Tang Xiu. He stared at his tranquil expression and inquisitively asked in a deep voice, “Tang Xiu, did you get this technology from that three-star vestige?”</p><p>“Senior Duanmu, I did get some tech gadgets from that three-star vestige, but it doesn’t include this energy shield.” Tang Xiu shook his head and said, “You also have seen the array I’ve arranged. This energy shield is formed when that array is activated. An array has been installed on the Hectometer Aeroglider, so starting it is equal to activating the defensive array and forming that energy shield. Don’t you realize this is the reason the energy batteries can only last up to 100km?”</p><p>Duanmu Lin caught the explanation instantly, but he couldn’t get Tang Xiu’s last question. “What facet should I’ve realized, though?”</p><p>His question made Tang Xiu feel helpless. “It’s about the consumption of the batteries! The Hectometer Aeroglider could’ve been able to fly at least 500km or further should the energy batteries not expend so much power on the energy shield.”</p><p>Duanmu Lin understood in a flash. Then, he nodded and said, “That makes sense. I’ve done my own research on arrays, but I found most of the materials needed to arrange them are jade stones. Speaking about it, such energy comes from the jadeites, right?”</p><p>“That’s correct.” Tang Xiu nodded.</p><p>Giving him a thumbs up, Duanmu Lin praised. “To think that you actually applied some aspects of cultivation on this tech product, I can only use the word ‘awesome’ to express my feeling. You’re really a genius, Tang Xiu—indigenous talent that definitely transcends everyone else.”</p><p>“Hahaha.” Tang Xiu couldn’t help laughing and said, “You’re flattering me, Senior Duanmu. Anyways, what about the third question?”</p><p>“The last one is about the features for the upgraded version of this Hectometer Aeroglider,” said Duanmu Lin. “Will it have other functions? I can sign the contract with you here and now if your answer satisfies me.”</p><p>Tang Xiu and Kang Xia exchanged glances. Just as the latter was about to speak, Tang Xiu slightly raised his hand to stop her and said, “I can guarantee that the upgraded version of the Hectometer Aeroglider will have at least one more feature.”</p><p>“And that is?” asked Duanmu Lin impatiently.</p><p>“Invisibility,” answered Tang Xiu.</p><p>“What?!!”</p><p>Tang Xiu’s answered shocked and scared Duanmu Lin. Invisibility meant stealth. Anything that could go invisible in this world would be horrifying.</p><p>“There’s one caveat of this invisible Hectometer Aeroglider, however,” continued Tang Xiu. “We’re not prepared to sell them since this feature is too terrifying. It will cause great damage should evil people use it.”</p><p>Aside from feeling relieved, Duanmu Lin was burning inside. If this Hectometer Aeroglider had such a stealth feature, it was definitely on par with the so-called divine armament. If all the Chinese soldiers in the future used this gadget and went into stealth mode after starting it, they would definitely be able to completely annihilate all the enemies they fought, literally! After all, the enemies couldn’t see them, but they could clearly see them. They could just come before the enemies without them being aware of anything… such an effect was…</p><p>Shooting a deep gaze at Tang Xiu, Duanmu Lin said, “I have trust in your character and I believe your guarantee. Tang Xiu, if your Magnificent Tang Corp. develops this stealth version of Hectometer Aeroglider, you must never sell them to anyone or any force besides the Chinese Special Abilities Bureau. Otherwise, it will change the power structure in the world tremendously. Such a change will only spell enormous hidden dangers to various countries.”</p><p>“I have discretion on this matter, so you can rest assured about that.” Tang Xiu nodded. “Additionally, even if we do decide to sell this product to the Chinese military, we won’t be able to sell too many of them, since I need to personally be involved in manufacturing it. My time is very limited, so I can only sell 100 units to the Chinese military. That’s the limit.”</p><p>“That’s enough!” Duanmu Lin happily nodded.</p><p>“Well, shall we sign the contract now, then?” continued Tang Xiu with a smile.</p><p>“I have a hunch that you should’ve prepared the contract already,” said Duanmu Lin. “Just show it to us. We’ll sign it now if we think there’s no problem with the clauses.”</p><p>Tang Xiu faintly smiled and made a gesture to Kang Xia. The latter then immediately called the core executive of Magnificent Tang Corp. to bring two contracts. Without any concern, Tang Xiu quietly waited for Duanmu Lin and the several senior officers of the Special Abilities Bureau to finish reading it.</p><p>“There’s no problem with the contract, though the quantity has yet to be filled. It should be left to us to decide, shouldn’t it?” said Duanmu Lin with a smile.</p><p>“That’s certain.” Tang Xiu nodded and said, “Besides, I don’t know how big the order the state is to place, to begin with. If the number is too low, I’ll have to promote this Aeroglider to the private sector. After all, we’ve invested too much capital, time, and manpower for its research and development. We won’t have any profits if the sales figure is too low, even likely suffering some losses.”</p><p>“Alright. But I need to make a call.” Duanmu Lin nodded.</p><p>“Please feel free to do so,” replied Tang Xiu with a smile.</p><p>Duanmu Lin then got up and left the hall with the Special Abilities Bureau’s senior officers.</p><p>Nearby, incomparably shocking expressions were painted on the faces of Yuan Chuling, Yue Kai, Hu Qingsong, and even Cheng Yannan, who had a special ability. They were just sitting dumbly and tongue-tied on the leather sofa, unable to sober up from their shocks.</p><p>Prior to this, they thought that the Magnificent Tang Corp. only manufactured a few products, mainly cosmetics and some nutrient and supplement products, or the likes of excellent wine such as God’s Nectar. But now, after hearing the content of the conversation between Tang Xiu and Duanmu Lin, they were really shocked since they realized that the MTC also had other products that could be described with one word: terrifying!</p><p>The Aeroglider! An object that could only be seen in science fiction literature and sci-fi movies. The level of technology mentioned was at least a few decades ahead of the current technology. It was even likely to be a century ahead.</p><p>Tang Xiu watched the four people and a smile crept upon his face. He coughed twice and smilingly asked, “Well, are you guys scared? Do you realize that what I do is the so-called big business now?”</p><p>Yuan Chuling’s family had inextricable links with the military. His father had also got his hands on the research and development of weapon technology and sold them to the military. Therefore, he was still able to grasp some of the contents. He was the first to sober up among the four. However, his eyes as he looked at Tang Xiu were full of inexplicable shock and mixed feelings.</p><p>“You shouldn’t have brought us over here, Big Bro.” Yuan Chuling took a deep breath and forced a smile.</p><p>“You’re aware of it now?” asked Tang Xiu with raised brows.</p><p>“I’ll be a damn idiot if I can’t realize anything.” Yuan Chuling nodded and said, “That’s the core secret of your Magnificent Tang Corporation, but it’s also the country’s secret. Big Bro Tang, I think you shouldn’t have brought us over even if you trust us.”</p><p>‘Realizing and being aware of it?’</p><p>Yue Kai, Hu Qingsong, and Cheng Yannan, who just sobered up from their shocks, hurled tons of curses at Yuan Chuling inwardly. They didn’t realize anything about the situation, but after this fella made it clear, it was just as clear as day that he lumped them like idiots in some other words!</p><p>“I believe you all, guys. What I trust in is not only your character, but I also believe that you won’t dare to disclose it to anyone else.” Tang Xiu smilingly said, “Senior Duanmu is the state official in charge of a very special department. If you dare to disclose anything about this matter, it will mean that you’re selling a state secret. You guys won’t only end up in the military courts, but also be executed.”</p><p>GASP!</p><p>Yuan Chuling’s group of four gasped a cold air at the same time.</p><p>“Okay, nevermind it, though. Just keep it rotten inside your belly.” Tang Xiu smiled and said, “Besides, it won’t take long before the Magnificent Tang Corp. announces the Hectometer Aeroglider to the public. Well, it should be next year when we begin to sell it to the customers around the world.”</p><p>The four people immediately let out sighs of relief upon hearing the news. All of them looked excited. If the Magnificent Tang Corp. were to sell the Hectometer Aeroglider to the public, didn’t it mean that they could also buy it?</p><p>Being able to fly was always a human dream, to begin with. They were all ordinary people and thus were no exception. They looked at the Hectometer Aeroglider on the table and began fantasizing… riding the Hectometer Aeroglider… flying to sky and hovering above the island… such a free flight… like a bird.</p><p>Duanmu Lin and the senior executives from the Special Abilities Bureau then returned to the hall. Looks of joy could be seen on their faces. After each one of them took a seat, Duanmu Lin then spoke, “Tang Xiu, the Big Boss wants me to convey his message to you.”</p><p>Tang Xiu’s face slightly changed and nodded with a serious face. “What’s his instruction?”</p><p>“If you want to fully operate the manufacturing of Hectometer Aeroglider into ordinary business and sell it to the public, it must be done after you’ve developed the upgraded version of this product,” said Duanmu Lin. “Our country must grasp the most advanced Aeroglider, which is at least much more advanced than the ordinary ones sold on the market.”</p><p>“That won’t be a problem.” Tang Xiu quickly nodded.</p><p>“Also, the Magnificent Tang Corp can sell the product to domestic buyers and the country won’t be participating,” continued Duanmu Lin. “But if you want to sell this product globally, would you like to cooperate with the country? You should know that this product will bring about tremendous influence to the world once it goes global. With the country as your backing, your company will have the biggest guarantor and safeguard.”</p><p>Tang Xiu was shocked and then asked, “What does the country want for these?”</p><p>“Well, the Big Boss wants the price to be halved starting from the upgraded version,” answered Duanmu Lin with a smile. “Of course, the state will also provide great support for all the businesses under your company all over China with various preferential policies.”</p><p>“Deal!” Tang Xiu agreed without hesitation. He was very satisfied with the proposal.</p><p>Duanmu Lin smiled and said, “If so, let’s sign the contract, then! For the first order, we want 10,000 Hectometer Aeroglider and one million energy batteries. The money will be immediately wired to your private account once we receive the products.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
