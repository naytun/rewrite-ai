But he was left stunned once he saw container trucks coming one after another and carts of bronze and pig iron with over a thousand porters moving them into the underground warehouse.</p><p>Furthermore, gold and silver were also sent in large numbers. A lot of them were even manufactured products such as fine jewelry. Although he didn’t do a specific calculation, he could estimate the value of all the gold and silver. If they were converted into cash, it would definitely exceed 100 million USD.</p><p>However, no matter how fast the gold, silver, copper, and iron were sent, the rate at which they were thrown into the Demon God Spirit Devourer Cauldron was faster. With the True Fire kept burning, the refining and extraction process to get the essences of gold, silver, copper, and iron were unceasingly carried out, and Tang Xiu eventually stored all of them into the jade bottles.</p><p>“I have enough now.”</p><p>After calling Kanaja and Zuo Daquan, the container trucks coming from all over Bangkok stopped coming and the porters gradually decreased.</p><p>Tang Xiu then stood in front of the cauldron, his eyes sparkling. The impression he had toward Zuo Daquan was neither good nor bad, but he found Kanaja to be a very interesting man. This man had an outstanding intellect, was prudent, and was also meticulously astute. Just for a piece of magic tool, he didn’t hesitate to invest so much. It was beyond his expectations. The refining materials in his interspatial ring added with the gold, silver, copper, and iron essences he just extracted from each respective ore were enough for him to manufacture magic-rank swords.</p><p>“Haih… refining is always a waste of time!”</p><p>Tang Xiu muttered. His eyes swept over the neatly placed jade bottles. When the last pig iron had been smelted, he collected the iron essence into the jade bottle and removed the precious ores from the ring lightning-fast, throwing them into the Demon God Spirit Devourer Cauldron.</p><p>The most important step in the refining process was to inscribe the array, integrate it to the embryo of the shaped sword, and then use the True Fire to burn through until it eventually formed a perfect magic-rank sword. Furthermore, due to the needs of massive mental power, Tang Xiu decided to refine many weapons at once.</p><p>“Melt the spirit—form the sword.”</p><p>As Tang Xiu controlled the lid of the cauldron and lift it up, a full set of 20 swords quickly flew out from the cauldron. With his spiritual power, he controlled them to hover around him unceasingly.</p><p>Standing ten meters away from him was Mo Awu. He watched dumbly at the 20 swords that flying around Tang Xiu with a gaping mouth. He knew that Tang Xiu was refining weapons, but never once had he expected that he would actually produce 20 swords at one shot.</p><p>Truly worthy of a Boss. His artificer skills are truly amazing.</p><p>Sighing inwardly, Mo Awu paced back. He suddenly felt a bit funny deep down. He had been watching the Boss refining something, yet he was unable to learn anything from it. Had it been Jin Shi, he was sure he would surely be able to learn a lot.</p><p>He knew that Jin Shi was very interested in array formations, while the basis of being an artificer was the requirement to draw the arrays for specific uses. If Jin Shi was here now, he’d definitely study it tirelessly and would ask Boss for advice if he couldn’t understand something.</p><p>Ah, forget it. It’s just an auxiliary technique. I’m still good at frontal clashes, so I don’t need to care much about arrays and refining techniques.</p><p>With a smiling face, Tang Xiu gently raised his hand. 20 scabbards then flew out of the cauldron. With his exquisite control, he manipulated the 20 swords to be sheathed in the scabbards instantly and wrapped the blades’ brilliant light.</p><p>At this time, Mo Awu spoke. “Boss, two days have just passed. Are we not in a hurry to go back to China?”</p><p>Tang Xiu hesitated for a moment and then said, “Let’s wait for a while. No need to rush even if we need to hurry. Spending a little more time won’t be a problem. But after we return to Jingmen Island and meet Yan’er, it’s necessary to store the refined magic weapons into our armory. They will be distributed to those who perform great merits and contributions in the future. Also…”</p><p>Seeing that Tang Xiu paused, Mo Awu was confused and immediately asked, “Also what, Boss?”</p><p>“We are facing archenemies at hand nowadays, so the more magic weapons we have, the better it will be for all of us,” said Tang Xiu in a deep voice. “I’ve been preparing to test all the peripheral members of the Everlasting Feast Hall to face strong enemies. If they can pass this trial, they will be incorporated into the core members. They will also be taught more advanced and profound cultivation arts. I’ll also open the Classics Library Pavilion for them, so they can learn other magic spells and the necessary knowledge for cultivators.”</p><p>“Classics Library Pavilion? Where is that?” asked Mo Awu with a confused face.</p><p>His question made Tang Xiu roll his eyes at him and snap. “Did you notice that I wrote a large number of books back when we left Nine Dragons Island? I put a lot of cultivation manuals, rare magic spells, general knowledge on cultivation, as well books that covered various aspects into the attic room. I wrote the inscription there myself and named it Classics Library Pavilion. Don’t tell me you don’t know about that?”</p><p>“Ugh…” Mo Awu shook his head vacantly and muttered, “I never heard of anyone mention it! When Boss was busy with something, I got nothing to do and went to seclusion and cultivated every day. But it’s strange, though. Why haven’t Jin Shi and the rest mentioned it to me?”</p><p>At his muttering, Tang Xiu forced a wry smile and said, “Awu, I know that you’re a cultivation lunatic. You always spend your time in cultivation whenever you’re not with me. But you must keep in mind that being a cultivator needs not only cultivation, you also need to understand more practical knowledge, learn various spells, and delve into all kinds of secret arts. All things considered, you must still learn other important skills, be it array formations, refining, or alchemy, even if you’re not proficient at any of them. Still, you must grasp at least common arrays, refining, alchemy, and other skills. Otherwise, you’ll suffer losses when you follow me to a new place someday.”</p><p>“I thought that as long as my cultivation is high enough and I’m powerful enough, wouldn’t it be just fine if I don’t learn other subjects, Boss?” asked Mo Awu.</p><p>“You also know that you must know yourself and your enemies to be unbeatable, don’t you?” Tang Xiu became serious and solemnly said, “What if your enemy is an array master and trapped you inside the array he created? How can you fight with him head-on? You’ve seen that I also laid out a big array to trap and kill enemies before, haven’t you? In the case of alchemy, you’ll need to concoct heavenly and earthly treasures into pills to provide yourself cultivation resources. What if you happen to go to some places in the future and there’s no alchemy expert to help you concoct them? Are you just going to watch the resources go to waste and lament at your weakness? Another example is being an artificer. You can always refine the most suitable weapon for yourself whenever you need it. Even if you have your immortal sword now, what about it? How much do you really know how to master it and how much power it can unleash?</p><p>“Magic spells are also another aspect you must know.”</p><p>Note: Wow… the shortest chapter I’ve ever translated.
