Tang Xiu himself turned as though a phantom that kept flickering and wandering inside the array, silently reaping the lives of demonic beasts. For the demonic beasts and enemy cultivators, the array was like the land of death. But it was like his own back garden to Tang Xiu.</p><p>ROAAR…</p><p>Hissss….</p><p>Countless demonic beasts roared and frantically launched their onslaught on the array, causing chaotic turbulence to the 14 linked arrays. After half an hour of slaughter, Tang Xiu rushed out of the array with a wretched appearance, his clothes soaked with blood as though he was just fished out from a pool of blood.</p><p>“Tang Xiu!”</p><p>A lightning-fast shadow bolted from nearby, followed by the others who wore worried expressions and awe.</p><p>Wiping off the blood on his face, Tang Xiu hurriedly asked, “Who are these people, Senior Duanmu?”</p><p>Taking a deep breath, Duanmu Lin grabbed the communicator, pressed the green button, and shouted, “Killing Squad Warriors, enter the arrays now!”</p><p>Shortly after, a group of shadows bolted from the distance and rushed into the arrays in the blink of an eye. They were the 140 cultivators who were invited by Duanmu Lin by various means and then sent to Tang Xiu a week ago to learn about the arrays’ operation.</p><p>Although they didn’t have a thorough understanding of the arrays, they could remember the route and orientation within the formation to kill demonic beasts that entered it. The weakest among them was at the late-stage of Foundation Establishment while the strongest were experts at the Golden Core Stage.</p><p>Each group consisted of 10 people. They quickly took advantage of the array right after entering it. They were like petrol that was poured on the fire that burned and killed the demonic beasts inside the array. The 140 people could easily enter and retreat while attacking and defending at the same time. However, the number of demonic beasts was really too many that they were simply jam-packed inside the array.</p><p>“We can’t hold it anymore! Retreat quickly!”</p><p>A cultivator manipulating the array suddenly coughed up a mouthful of blood and shouted. The remaining six cultivators who were still alive inside rushed out of the array with scars a few seconds after. They were panting heavily and hadn’t had time to breathe more as the array was broken.</p><p>Shortly after, the other arrays also followed suit. One of the cultivators who had escaped was badly battered and desperately dashed through the blockade line, looking a bit despaired. All of the remaining ones were seriously injured and must be treated promptly. They would only meet their deaths otherwise should they participate in the next battle.</p><p>Tang Xiu, who had changed his clothes at this moment, crazily absorbed the demonic energy in the Demon Cores to supplement his energy consumption. Chilling light overflowing from his eyes upon seeing that the 14 arrays had been broken. His figure soared and the divine sword instantly swept away to crush a certain flying demonic beast.</p><p>“Demons and Immortals Slaughtering Array!”</p><p>A deafening voice instantly spread into the sky. A thick blood fog was formed by the blood of the demonic beasts and humans, filling the area tens of kilometers around the blockade line, and ultimately created a boundless ocean of blood that killed all the demonic beasts inside. The Demons and Immortals Slaughtering Array covered a very large area and enveloped at least tens of thousands of demonic beasts.</p><p>CRACK… BOOM…</p><p>Violent thunderstorms were as though clapping down from the highest vault of heaven, making all the demonic beasts in the array howl. The sound seemed to be able to destroy the souls and control their minds. It was like it was the voice of Buddhas and Demons, yet it brought extreme aggressiveness within. At the same time, lightning flashed down like a hurricane. Each lightning bolt was the size of an arm that severely wounded Golden Core Stage demonic beasts and killed those at the Foundation Establishment Stage.</p><p><em>Ting, ting, ting…</em></p><p>Suddenly, the magnetic sound of a zither drifted from outside of the Demons and Immortals Slaughtering Array. In nearly an instant, the tens of thousands of demonic beasts inside the array felt like the world before them had changed. They seemed to see the place where they were born, seeing their hometown and smelling the aura of the soil in their Demon Realm. They could even hear the unique howling winds of their birthplace.</p><p>Puff… puff… puff…</p><p>Lightning flashed down like rain.</p><p>Each and every demonic beast that died in the lightning rain died, yet they wore smiling faces as their bodies slowly fell down. The ground was littered by their corpses while blood created a scarlet river. In just half a minute, the tens of thousands of demonic beasts met their deaths by the lightning blasts.</p><p>ROAAARR…</p><p>The building-sized demonic beast at the Nascent Soul Stage noticed that something was amiss after rushing out of the Demons and Immortals Slaughtering Array. It let out a furious roar as countless black scimitars appeared out of the blue and clashed with the blasting lightning bolts. Suddenly, the lightning bolts were blocked for a time and significantly slowed down the killings of demonic beasts.</p><p><em>Ting, ting, ting…</em></p><p>The syllable from the zither outside the array suddenly changed its tone. The notes now turned like a blasting storm like the collision between iron horses. Suddenly, all the Foundation Establishment demonic beasts in the Demons and Immortals Slaughtering Array lost their smiling faces to looks of pain.</p><p>While controlling the Demons and Immortals Slaughtering Array to slay demonic beasts, Tang Xiu slightly furrowed his brows as he knew the person who just came from the moment the zither’s play sounded.</p><p><em>It’s Han Qingwu! But she’s also Xue Qingcheng!</em></p><p>The feelings he had towards her were very complicated. Even after he knew that Han Qingwu was Xue Qingcheng; even though his heart was so much in pain and full of hatred towards her, he never had the heart to ruthlessly kill her. From that moment onward, he thought that it was the best choice to sever all ties with her.</p><p>And yet, he never thought that she would fight alongside him to kill these demonic beasts at this moment. He could tell that Han Qingwu… no… Xue Qingcheng should have restored her power to the Spirit Formation Stage from the notes played by her zither.</p><p>At the blockade line.</p><p>The eyes of thousands of cultivators were all trained on Han Qingwu, who was sitting on a floating bluestone. Watching as she sat cross-legged while playing her zither made them incomparably shocked.</p><p>The zither’s notes didn’t affect them too much. But it was because Han Qingwu deliberately controlled it that the effects on them were negligible. Yet, it still made their countenance extremely solemn. Even the many cultivators who had weaker strength retreated over 100 hundred meters staggeringly while wiping off the cold sweat on their foreheads with lingering fear evident on their faces.</p><p>The zither’s notes they heard just now nearly pulled them into the mood state ordained by the syllables. They even secretly had a sensation that they would be severely injured and face the risk of death if they were pulled into the mood ordained by the zither.</p><p>“Who’s she?”</p><p>The middle-aged Nascent Soul Stage Taoist nun wore a disbelieving look, and so did the amiable-looking old man and the stalwart big man. All of their eyes were trained on Han Qingwu, refusing to take back their focus even if they wanted to.</p><p>She was at the Spirit Formation Stage!</p><p>These three Nascent Soul Stage experts were naturally able to sense the aura fluctuating from Han Qingwu. What shocked them was this young woman, who attacked the demonic beasts with zither notes, turned out to be an expert at the Spirit Formation Stage.</p><p>“Given her age, she’s unlikely to be some old fogy who has been cultivating for a century or more. If my guess is correct, she should be at her 20s, but it’s too unbelievable and too shocking for her to reach the Spirit Formation Stage in her 20s.”</p><p>“True that. She’s really only in her 20s. I’m sure of it. But what I really want to figure out is what kind of cultivation art she has been cultivating in, exactly? For one to reach the Spirit Formation Stage in such a short time, doesn’t it mean that it must be much more powerful than the ones cultivated by us, who have been cultivating for centuries?”</p><p>“If it weren’t for the threat of these demonic beasts at the present and the fact that she’s much stronger than us, I would’ve robbed her of that particular cultivation art. But this lass is by no means ordinary. It’s an understatement calling her simply terrifying.”</p><p>After the shock, the three people wore extremely complicated expressions as they watched Han Qingwu play her zither and exchanged whispers.</p><p>Not far away from them, Duanmu Lin was dumbfounded as he looked at Han Qingwu. He was simply unable to notice anything the moment she showed up. He didn’t even know how she arrived here.</p><p>“How did she appear here?”</p><p>“I dunno. She seemed to have just popped up out of nowhere.” Aquababe shook her head.</p><p>Shooting Han Qingwu a deep gaze, Duanmu Lin’s eyes then shifted to the Demons and Immortals Slaughtering Array in front. Although he couldn’t see what was happening inside, he was sure that Tang Xiu was going all out to kill all the demonic beasts inside it at the moment. He also knew who Han Qingwu was. Back when he sent people to investigate Tang Xiu, there was also information about her. Therefore, while recalling how unfathomable and terrifying Tang Xiu was, he secretly analyzed that this young woman named Han Qingwu should’ve learned cultivation from Tang Xiu, which ultimately made her have such a powerful strength.</p><p>Inside the Demons and Immortals Slaughtering Array, Tang Xiu’s killing speed was getting faster and faster. Due to Han Qingwu’s zither notes’ onslaught, the demonic beasts inside were getting weaker and losing their resistance, literally transforming the scene into a one-sided slaughter. The zither notes also affected those Nascent Soul Stage demonic beasts, causing them to be unable to unleash their full power.</p><p>“DAMN HUMANS! Fuck this immortal music!”</p><p>Archfiend Rupture, with the other demonic beasts who had the power comparable to experts at the Nascent Soul Stage, then appeared in the Demons and Immortal Slaughtering Array. They instantly cast their respective magical arts and finally blocked the lightning bolts onslaught.</p><p>“This is making me furious, and my king is also very angry! You damn humans, you are killing my Demon Realm’s clansmen. You must die and leave your soul into nothingness!”</p><p>Archfiend Rupture roared and howled. The other two Nascent Soul Stage demonic beasts teamed up to unleash their own powers, causing chaotic turbulences to the Demons and Immortals Slaughtering Array and making it look like it would be broken at any time.</p><p>Standing at the eye of the array, Tang Xiu’s eyes were filled with coldness. The array constantly trembled as a ruthless look finally appeared on his face. He instantly pierced his own chest with the divine sword and forced out 10 drops of his blood essence.</p><p>“Blood Ignition Art!”</p><p>He made blurred gestures to cast a seal as a mysterious and profound aura kept soaring. The 10 drops of blood essence from his heart then formed into a complicated blood net that spread in all directions before completely disappearing in but a few breaths.</p><p>“My heart is heaven; the world is a furnace. With this sacrifice of my blood, then shall it turn into Demonic Flame!!!”</p><p>Even as his voice had yet to dissipate, Tang Xiu’s figure had appeared outside the Demons and Immortals Slaughtering Array. He coughed up a few mouthfuls of blood before his body fell and loudly hit the ground.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
