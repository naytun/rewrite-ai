The Fire Qilin just left in joy, leaving him in silence for a very long time. Before it left, it said the name of the Vermillion Bird Holy Sect’s Guardian Beast. The name was exactly the same name as the one Tang Xiu knew.</p><p>Prior to this, Tang Xiu only believed one-third of the words said by the Fire Qilin. But after it mentioned that name, he had 70% assurance of its story. Yet, he still held onto 10% suspiciousness and couldn’t put down his wariness. He would, after all, face his enemies once he returned to the Immortal World, and some of them were at the Supremacy Stage.</p><p>The Vermillion Bird Holy Sect was by no means weak in the Immortal World. It was instead very powerful with an expert at the Supremacy Stage at the helm. The Vermillion Bird Holy Sect was naturally not afraid if there was only a Supreme among his enemies. But it would still face a very difficult situation for the sake of saving his life if there were several Supremes when he had yet to restore his peak power.</p><p>Additionally, there was also his archenemy, the Shade Demon Zhu Wushou.</p><p>After a long time passed, Tang Xiu turned his head to look at Xue Yu at the side, who wore a complicated look. Then, he forced a smile and said, “You now know about my origins, don’t you? Well, are you now going to give me a cold shoulder after knowing that I’m just an old freak who has lived for ten millenniums?”</p><p>“Nah.” Xue Yu shook her head and said, “As people said: just be contented with the man you married. Marry a chicken and just follow that chicken; marry a dog then follow that dog. Even if you tell me you were a monkey who lived for ten millenniums, I’ll never leave your side.”</p><p>“Pfft…” Tang Xiu couldn’t help but chuckle. He hugged Xue Yu and said, “Well, I never thought the Jade Beauty is humorous, though. I never knew that you had such a side prior to this, you know.”</p><p>“Bah, shameless!” Xue Yu retorted shyly.</p><p>Returning to Jingmen Island’s Everlasting Feast Hall, Tang Xiu immediately led several experts of his sect to leave for the two islands in the South China Sea. After inspecting them, he was satisfied by both the fierce beasts ranch and the medicinal herbs plantation. In particular, the fierce beasts ranch. Although the beasts there were caged, they began to breed since they didn’t need to worry about food or water, thus leading to quite a number of their population.</p><p>On the way back, Tang Xiu’s liner encountered a yacht. What he didn’t expect was that the person who was enjoying sunbathing, holding a cup of red wine and wearing a bikini was none other than Cheng Yannan, who he hadn’t met for a long time.</p><p>“Wow, let’s have a cup of wine, Belle!”</p><p>Standing on the bow of the liner, Tang Xiu smiled spoke to Chen Yannan who was about 100 meters away. His voice was not loud, but it was clearly transmitted to Cheng Yannan’s ear.</p><p>“Huh?!!”</p><p>The moment she spotted Tang Xiu, Cheng Yannan instantly screamed. A smile immediately crept up on her face. She stood up and waved, shouting, “Hey, that’s fine with me! I got some good wine with me. You wanna come over and have a taste?”</p><p>Tang Xiu smiled faintly and instantly jumped from the bow. He casually walked on the sea surface and came to the yacht several seconds after. Then, he observed Cheng Yannan, whom he hadn’t met for a long time, and smilingly said, “Well, to think that you just got your own holiday at sea. I never thought Ms. Cheng is so natural and unrestrained. Anyways, did you get the news from your sister? You’re not that worried about her anymore, right?”</p><p>“Thanks for saving my big sis, Tang Xiu,” replied Cheng Yannan smilingly.</p><p>“Don’t mention it.” Tang Xiu smiled and said, “If anything, the Great Policewoman Cheng helped me quite a lot then. It’s kinda a given that I saved her once.”</p><p>“That’s not what I mean, you know.” Cheng Yannan shook her head and said, “If I’m not wrong, my big sis should’ve been working with you, right?”</p><p>Tang Xiu raised his brows and his eyes began to linger on her whole body. After seeing her turn shy, he asked with a quaint expression, “Did your special ability awaken?”</p><p>His question made Cheng Yannan stared blankly. The shy look on her face instantly vanished and was replaced by surprise. “How did you find out? I don’t think I used any special abilities just now, no?”</p><p>“You know, would you believe it if I told you that the Mount Huaguo was mine?” asked Tang Xiu with a smile.</p><p>“Pfft…” Cheng Yannan couldn’t help but laugh. She rolled her eyes at Tang Xiu and said, “Bah, do you really think you’re Sun Wukong who has Fiery Golden Eyes of Truth or something? Well, you’re right, though. I’ve indeed awakened my special ability. I was kinda freaked out at first, but then gradually got used to it. Besides, big sis called me, so I learned about such special abilities from her.”</p><p>“You sisters are connected by blood, after all.” Tang Xiu smilingly said, “I thought that you’d also awaken your special ability sooner or later since your sister has awakened hers. Keep in mind, though. Don’t ever use your power before the average people, else some people will quickly find you once it’s exposed. You’ll find yourself in a lot of trouble once they find you.”</p><p>The smile on Cheng Yannan’s face disappeared. She then asked with a frown, “What do you mean? Who are these people and what trouble will they give me?”</p><p>“They are from the country’s Special Abilities Bureau,” answered Tang Xiu.</p><p>“Huh? Which department is this agency from?” asked Cheng Yannan curiously.</p><p>“Speaking about it plainly, most of the people there are ability users or elementalists,” said Tang Xiu with a smile. “They seek people of their kind and then invite them to join the agency and work for the country. You can expect to face extraordinary dangers if you become one of them. For example, the recent major incident in the country. As far as I know, the number of ability users that died in the battle is over 100.”</p><p>‘Ability users? And they died in battle?’</p><p>Cheng Yannan was still shocked and frightened even though she wasn’t clear what it was about. She immediately stared at Tang Xiu with an uncertain look, inquiring. “What exactly happened? How can so many ability users die? You’re not lying to me, are you, Tang Xiu? I can feel that I may be able to kill those who are called ability users one day ever since I have this power.”</p><p>“Do you think ability users are very difficult to kill?” asked Tang Xiu back instead of answering.</p><p>Cheng Yannan suddenly fell into silence after recalling the terrifying power possessed by Tang Xiu and his men. It was true. Tang Xiu and his men had the power to kill the so-called ability users.</p><p>“Let’s drop it off, shall we?” Tang Xiu waved and said, “If anything, I heard from the supervisor of Clam Island that you’ve been performing well in recent months. Especially regarding your wood-based special ability which can ruin as well as aid the fast growth of medicinal herbs. That’s certainly a great achievement, so keep up the hard-good work later. I’ll make you the one in charge of the two islands later once I move the current one later.”</p><p>“Are you really going to make me the supervisor for these two islands?” Cheng Yannan’s eyes lit up.</p><p>“Hold up. Don’t get so excited yet,” said Tang Xiu smilingly. “That’s on the pretext that you’ve become completely familiar with the situations here. Only then will I give you the supervisor position, got it?”</p><p>“Hehehe. Then I expect a raise once it happens!” Cheng Yannan laughed.</p><p>“Hahaha.” Tang Xiu couldn’t help laughing and said, “I told the current supervisor to raise your salary ten times previously, didn’t I? Hahaha… well, I guess I can’t be stingy after you’ve become an ability user.”</p><p>“Well, you’re still brighter than that fella Yuan Chuling, old classmate!” Cheng Yannan gave a thumbs up and praised. “Anyhow, I’m borrowing this yacht from him, yet he took out most of the good wine he hid here before I came, lest I drink up all his red wine.”</p><p>Tang Xiu’s complexion shifted and he curiously asked, “Huh? I haven’t had time to contact that fella recently. How is he doing now? What did he buy this yacht and run to Jingmen Island for?”</p><p>“Well, I got no idea about that.” Cheng Yannan shook her head and said, “I only know that he recently got along with two students from Shanghai University. They kinda hang around together lately, though I dunno what they are doing. Ah, that’s right. I heard those two Shanghai University students are your classmates too!”</p><p>“My classmates?!” Tang Xiu wore a strange expression upon hearing this. He gave it a thought before asking, “Anyways, are you going to continue your leisure time here, or are you going back to Jingmen Island with us? I think I’m gonna meet Yuan Chuling since that fella is there.”</p><p>“Well, I think I’m going back with you. I’ve been playing here for a long time already,” answered Cheng Yannan.</p><p>On Jingmen Island…</p><p>In the presidential suite on the 18th floor of Venus Hotel, Yuan Chuling was nesting comfortably on the cozy sofa with one leg over the other. On his opposite side was Yue Kai, who was smoking with a happy face, while the one who was panting heavily like a cow struck with asthma and sweating profusely was Hu Qingsong. The three of them were facing the tea tables in front with a million yuan notes neatly arranged.</p><p>“You still okay, Old Hu? I told you this one million will all be yours if you can do 200 push-ups and 200 sit-ups. Otherwise, I and Yue Kai will each take our share from it.” Yuan Chuling’s face twitched and looked ferocious as he let out a strange smirk.</p><p>In response, Hu Qingsong glared at him as he squatted back to the carpet and did some push-ups. Ultimately, he was finally able to finish 200 push-ups, albeit barely, and nearly collapsed out of breath.</p><p>Shortly after, however, his body seemed to have been injected by another power. He directly crawled up from the floor to grab a black handbag nearby, stuffing the one million notes into the bag completely. Then, he proudly declared: “You dare to bet, so you must dare to lose. Dammit, I’m done for yesterday, Dude. But this million is mine!”</p><p>“Hahaha!” Yue Kai puffed out rings of smoke and laughed aloud. Then, he said, “I told you we made tens of millions recently, Old Hu. You got your four million shares, didn’t you? Yet you were so desperate and went all out just for this one million? That’s no big deal, dude. Well, I’m gonna visit a few spas later and I’m gonna nail some chicks and get laid!”</p><p>“Haven’t you bastard had enough already? I really got no idea why you’re so starving, man. I love my kidney though it’s hard to hold back, Dude.” Hu Qingsong mocked him and said, “And don’t give me that crap, Yuan Chuling. We made so much money recently, but shouldn’t we go back to Shanghai now?”</p><p>“Nah.” Yuan Chuling shook his head and said, “Getting out like this while making quite some money from the business is hard to come by, mate. Stopping now means we’ll lose money. Anyhow, both of you are Tang Xiu’s classmates and brothers, so we’re a gang. You gotta relax, mate. I guarantee you’ll have a cozy life and get tons of money if you got along with this Old Yuan, got it?”</p><p>“Old Yuan, I think Old Hu makes sense.” Yue Kai cast away his smiling face and said, “We must know when to stop. That’s the golden rule. We got those brats fleeced and profited out of them. But those shits are troublemakers, especially that Han Sen fella. He’s definitely a ruthless shit. We’ll be done for if he spends some money and comes back with some good Dahuang dogs. Won’t we be losing the money we’ve earned with so much difficulty by then?”</p><p>“That’s impossible!” Yuan Chuling complacently said, “Dahuang dogs have the blood of Tibetan Mastiffs. They can fight well and are definitely the king of dogs!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
