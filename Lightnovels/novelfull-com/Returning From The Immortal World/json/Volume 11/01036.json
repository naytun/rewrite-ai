Even in his dreams, to think that his Master Tang Xiu actually came from another world that all humanity longed for… the legendary Immortal World…</p><p>At the same time, he was also shocked by these Diablo Praecantator clansmen. They had been imprisoned here for hundreds of thousands of years and yet still survived to the present—something that was much more unbelievable and mysterious than the myth itself.</p><p>“What exactly is the Diablo Praecantator Forbidden Curse and the Life and Death Nightmare, Master?” Chen Zhizhong inquired while suppressing his shock.</p><p>“It’s a fearsome curse exclusive to the Diablo Praecantator Clan known as Life and Death Nightmare,” explained Tang Xiu.</p><p>“Is this curse very powerful?” asked Chen Zhizhong with a curious face.</p><p>Narrowing his eyes, Tang Xiu glanced at the Diablo Praecantator clansmen and slowly narrated. “That’s something told in the legend that the legendary Magus of this clan is proficient in casting a very mysterious and secret magic curse. This curse has no effect on others aside from their clansmen. Once the Diablo Praecantator clansmen use this curse on themselves, their lifespan will increase by tens of million times with 10,000 years in a cycle where they can only wake up for 100 years for every cycle and spend the rest of the cycle time sleeping. It’s for this reason that they can live for so long, much longer than the immortals who are at the same cultivation level as them.”</p><p>The face of Discalceate Diabolos turned grim and his murderous aura seemed to have condensed into substance as he said fiercely, “You’re right. Everything said about this legend is true. I just don’t know whether you’re lucky or not since you happened to meet us when we’re at the waking phase. The Life and Death Nightmare is a secret curse of my Diablo Praecantator Clan which indeed can make our people live for a long time. Yet, it’s also the alternative of death itself. We can only be awake for 100 years, but every time we wake up, the world changes along with everything we know. When we haven’t yet fully understood the new world, we then fall into slumber yet again for nearly 10,000 years, only to wake up 100 years later again. The cycle continues on and on. It becomes torture and torment no average men can ever imagine to feel. If… if we did have a choice and weren’t forced by the situation, there wouldn’t have been anyone from my clan to cast this Life and Death Nightmare curse on themselves.”</p><p>Tang Xiu gazed at these Diablo Praecantator clansmen with some pity. He never knew what situation these people faced, but the Discalceate Diabolos made it clear that only agony and torment were the results of this curse, that every member of this clan would rather die than seek such long lifespan yet limited in each cycle.</p><p>Discalceate Diabolos gradually took back his murderous aura. Then, he looked at Tang Xiu and asked in a deep voice, “Disciple of Vermillion Bird Holy Sect, can you help us escape from this place?”</p><p>“Frankly speaking, my hands are tied now even though I do really want to help you.” Tang Xiu shook his head and said, “Your power may have declined, less than one-thousandth of your prime, but you should be able to sense that there’s a big issue in my body and soul. The current me is far too weak, and regardless of how eager I am to help you, there’s nothing I can do. Unless… unless I can restore my power to the Perfected Golden Immortal Stage.”</p><p>The man thought for a long while and nodded wordlessly. Then, he said with a regretful face, “You’re right. It’s indeed nigh on impossible with your current power. This damn Diablo Array is too abstruse to crack, not even those at the Perfected Golden Realm Stage can break it unless they really comprehend the Diablo Array. In the beginning, there were tens of millions of Diablo Praecantator Clan’s warriors here. But no matter how hard we tried, we have never been able to break it, and couldn’t escape from this place.”</p><p>Tang Xiu frowned and said, “You mean, there were tens of millions of your clansmen warriors imprisoned here? But how come there are only you remaining…”</p><p>Discalceate Diabolos bitterly smiled and said, “Freedom and slaughter are instincts endowed to my clan. Without freedom, my clansmen might as well choose to commit suicide. Hahaha… tens of millions of elite warriors of my clan with the weakest at the Celestial Immortal Stage and tens at the Perfected Golden Immortal Stage, yet they chose to commit suicide… How fate ordained the most shameful way of death to fall on my clansmen…”</p><p>“But why are you still alive, though?” asked Tang Xiu.</p><p>While pointing to his chest, he replied, “It’s the flame in this heart that must keep burning. It’s the blood of our enemies that must be shed to wash away our shame. The choice of those tens of millions of my clansmen, the abysmal and worst luck that befell us, some of us chose to ignite the flame of revenge. For a long time must we survive, all to wait… wait for the day we can escape and see the light of day and use the blazing flame of revenge in our hearts to burn all the traitors and betrayers from the Sacred Pristine Palace.”</p><p>“It’s just unfortunate for you that all the people of the Sacred Pristine Palace have been killed more than 100,000 years ago.” Tang Xiu shook his head and said, “You’ve been barely lingering on your last breath of life, yet you can’t wash away your shame with their blood. But thankfully, your enemies are dead and your hatred-bound hearts can be freed now.”</p><p>Discalceate Diabolos slowly turned around and looked behind him at the hundreds of his clansmen who had been dragging out their feeble existences. He saw the gradually dissipating anger on their faces that now was being replaced by deep despair. Suddenly, he let out an ugly smile which was more unsightly than crying as he wildly laughed before shouting, “All my clansmen, did you hear it? Our enemies are dead. They are all dead. We’re still alive now, but what for? Isn’t the Sacred Pristine Palace already destroyed? All the wait we have been enduring has given us the result, so what are we still alive for?”</p><p>Amid the rave of madness, he suddenly raised his arm and a four-plus meters long warblade suddenly appeared out of thin air in his hand. Hundreds of his fellow clansmen also unleashed each of their immortal weapons, raising them up high in the air.</p><p>Outside the array, Tang Xiu’s countenance drastically changed as he saw the actions of hundreds of Diablo Praecantator clansmen. He then let out a deafening shout, “Legend has it that the Diablo Praecantator Clan are those who understood grace and gratitude the most. I brought you the news of the Sacred Pristine Palace’s destruction. Is it not a great grace that gives you a chance to liberate yourselves? Will you just commit suicide now and leave your debt unpaid?”</p><p>The several hundred Diablo Praecantator clansmen went stiff. They loved fighting, slaughter, and freedom. They had been a simple clan far from intrigues and machinations—the very reason why their clan was never the leader of a force and could only be a vassal race of a certain power.</p><p>The biggest merits their clan had been proud of was loyalty and sincerity was their strength!</p><p>Tang Xiu’s reminder made them temporarily cancel their thought to commit suicide. Hundreds of pairs of eyes stared at Tang Xiu, as Discalceate Diabolos then asked, “Disciple of Vermillion Bird Holy Sect, how would you like us to requite you our debt?”</p><p>Tang Xiu was silent for a moment, then suddenly pointed to Chen Zhizhong and replied with a deep voice, “Rumor has it that your Diablo Praecantator Clan has a secret art to turn other races’ physiques to yours while also inheriting your bloodline, all the while transforming them into the most perfect warrior. In any case, you’re all determined to leave this world, so you might as well help my disciple.”</p><p>Discalceate Diabolos deeply gazed at Chen Zhizhong before turning around and exchanged words with several hundreds of his clansmen. Then, he nodded and said, “He’s the first to discover us in the past 100,000 years, so it’s fate that made him the predestined friend of our Diablo Praecantator Clan. Although the current him is very weak, you’ve given us a grace—a favor we shall requite well. But all this requires consent from both sides. We shall comply with your request, but you need to enter this array if you want to obtain our heritage and become a perfect warrior. But once you come inside, you’ll never be able to get out.”</p><p>Tang Xiu turned to look at Chen Zhizhong and said with a deep voice, “Zhizhong, our ancestors once said that glory comes with danger. A vast path has now been laid bare before you, so I shall ask you. Do you dare or to enter this array to accept the inheritance of these Diablo Praecantator Clan seniors?”</p><p>Chen Zhizhong’s complexion changed. Should the Discalceate Diabolos tell the truth, what if I really can’t go out after entering the array? Can I endure the torment of loneliness of being imprisoned for countless years?</p><p>No!</p><p>His heart shook and he suddenly recalled another scenario. His Master, Tang Xiu, was an expert proficient in arrays. He might be able to break the array in front of him.</p><p>At this moment in time, Chen Zhizhong was in a dilemma. If his Master couldn’t break the array, then he’d be imprisoned for eternity. But if he could crack it down, didn’t it mean that it would be a huge chance for him?</p><p>What should I choose?</p><p>As time went by, Chen Zhizhong finally made up his mind and decided to choose to believe in his Master. He had decided to walk on the path to immortality—a journey and a game between life and death in and of itself. If he won, then he’d be reborn and achieve greatness in the future. If he lost, he could only blame his bad luck.</p><p>“I’ll take the chance, Master,” replied Chen Zhizhong with a resolute face and firm nod.</p><p>Tang Xiu looked satisfied, nodding and loudly replying, “Then you’re worthy of being Tang Xiu’s disciple! Just with your mentality and state of mind, you will have great achievements in the future! Then go inside! As long as you can get the inheritance of the Diablo Praecantator Clan seniors, I’ll definitely become a Perfected Golden Immortal in the future and I’ll absolutely be able to save you.”</p><p>“Understood!” replied Chen Zhizhong. He then walked towards the hundreds of Diablo Praecantator clansmen. The transparent energy shield didn’t stop his footsteps and he easily entered the array and arrived in front of Discalceate Diabolos.</p><p>Discalceate Diabolos looked at him with appreciation and highly praised. “My clan has always held unquestionable respect to those with heroic spirit, tough men with undying will and determination. You’re one hell of a man; a real tough guy!”</p><p>Chen Zhizhong took a deep breath. He turned to look at Tang Xiu and turned back again as he immediately cupped his fist and saluted. “In this way, then I must trouble you for the grace, Seniors.”</p><p>Discalceate Diabolos shifted his sight to Tang Xiu and said in a deep voice, “Dying is much better than passing into oblivion. I hope you don’t deceive us and I hope everything you said is true that all those from the Sacred Pristine Palace have been decimated.”</p><p>“Trust starts with truth and ends with truth,” said Tang Xiu solemnly.</p><p>Discalceate Diabolos nodded in response. He suddenly let out a sharp, long howl. Suddenly, hundreds of Diablo Praecantator clansmen floated up tens of meters high at the same time, each constantly changing their positions and soon forming a pattern like a spinning disc.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
