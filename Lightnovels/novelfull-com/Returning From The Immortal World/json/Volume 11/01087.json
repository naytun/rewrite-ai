Given its current condition, let alone fighting against the charging ferocious fighting dog, even a small Pekingese could kill it.</p><p>“Let’s go, guys!”</p><p>Tang Xiu patted Yue Kai’s shoulder and turned to walk towards the SUV. A dog fight gambling was nothing but a trivial thing that didn’t interest him whatsoever, as meaningless as seeing a child pee on the mud.</p><p>Yuan Chuling was staring blankly at the big yellow dog who got bitten to death in the iron cage. Disbelief was evident in his eyes, for he never imagined that this gambling would conclude in such fashion.</p><p>“3 million!”</p><p>Han Sen, who was surrounded by more than ten youths, went toward Yuan Chuling and hooked his finger. He complacently looked gloatingly at Yuan Chuling, as though he was looking at a clown.</p><p>Yuan Chuling turned around. He could see the equally stunned Yue Kai and Hu Qingsong and then growled angrily. “You cheated, didn’t you?”</p><p>“Heh, you gotta find the stolen goods before you catch a thief, don’t you know that? Don’t run your mouth and insult us by accusing without evidence, Yuan Chuling.” Han Sen retorted with disdain. “You brought this Dahuang dog yourself. How come we are at fault when it suddenly got sick and was killed by my dog, huh? Don’t tell me you can’t afford to be a loser?”</p><p>Something was amiss and Yuan Chuling knew it. Yet, he couldn’t retort back at Han Sen since he didn’t have any evidence that the fella was pulling a skullduggery. It now seemed like he was throwing slander and dirt to this guy.</p><p>“Fine! I’ll give you the money!”</p><p>He didn’t care about these 3 million since he had won more than this amount all these days. However, he couldn’t help but feel wronged inside. That big yellow dog had earned him tons of cash, yet it had been bitten to death in vain. After paying the money, he quickly paced towards Tang Xiu under the jeers of Han Sen’s group.</p><p>Tang Xiu shook his head and said, “You guys are truly fooling around; to think that you came to Jingmen Island just for this stunt. Haih, I wouldn’t have bothered to poke my nose into your business had it been before.”</p><p>“Didn’t you just mind it?” Feeling vexed, Yuan Chuling couldn’t help but retort back in a grunt.</p><p>“You know, your Dahuang dog had been drugged in advance. You just fell right into the scheme of those guys given how that dog completely lost its ability to fight right as the drug kicked in at the start of the fight.” Tang Xiu slightly furrowed his brows and lightly said, “Do you know what does that mean? It means someone close to you is the culprit since it’s difficult for outsiders to get into contact with your dog.”</p><p>“We got a traitor?”</p><p>Yuan Chuling, Yue Kai, and Hu Qingshong were shocked and exclaimed after exchanging glances.</p><p>“It’s best for you to cast away this mindless behavior later on,” continued Tang Xiu coolly. “I’m just glad those guys only poisoned your dog this time and not you, else you’d have turned into corpses by now. Especially you, Yuan Chuling. You’re not studying at Shanghai University, but you neglect your business and indulge yourself in this shit. You even make me lost any strength to mock you!”</p><p>“Uh, we got so bored recently, so we just run and fooled around Big Bro,” replied Yuan Chuling embarrassedly. “But we had decided that this game was the last one and we would return to Shanghai regardless of the results, though. Besides, I got some managers handling the business in Shanghai, so I don’t have to worry too much about that.”</p><p>“What if those managers dug the pit for you to fall?” Tang Xiu pursued inquisitively. “You’ll be easy prey if they were to collaborate to scheme against you. It’s better to believe in yourself than putting your trust in others. The market is a battlefield in and of itself. You can try neglecting the market and taking it lightly, but you can expect to end up dead on that battlefield.”</p><p>Yuan Chuling rolled his eyes in response and argued. “Are you scaring me by exaggerating it, Big Bro Tang? Our joint business does have some competition with other fitness clubs, but it doesn’t look like it will happen like you just said. Besides, our business is quite big. Even those managers got some balls, they won’t dare to act carelessly, no?”</p><p>“You said it’s a big business?”</p><p>At this time, Tang Xiu felt that it was necessary to give some good lessons to Yuan Chuling. He fished out his cell phone and leaned his back at door, dialing a number and asking, “Hello, Professor Mo, how is the progress with the development of that product? From the report you gave me some time ago, I presume that’s the finished product, right?”</p><p>“Ehh? Hasn’t Chief Kang already told you?” Mo Yi’s voice transmitted from the phone. “That product has been developed already and it works exceedingly well. Chief Kang has already begun the preparation for its mass production.”</p><p>“I see.”</p><p>He had been staying at the blockade line in the Himalayas a few days ago. The phone signal was abysmal there and he also got injured, so he just put away his cell phone into the interspatial ring and thus cut off his phone from receiving any signal at all. Even Kang Xia herself found it difficult to contact him.</p><p>Tang Xiu then dialed her number. The dialing tone only rang twice and his call got picked up. “Hello, it’s me, Kang Xia.”</p><p>Kang Xia’s complaining voice replied from the phone, “Where the hell are you now, Mister Big Boss?! Do you know I’ve been looking for you for several days already? You never picked up nor can I get through you every time I made a call! I called Xiaoxue and she said you went to the Himalayas to deal with some urgent things or something, so I dared not bother you.”</p><p>“That’s my fault, I admit. But it was, nevertheless, doing it for special reasons, so I didn’t bother to give you the number of the communicator.” Tang Xiu smiled and said, “Anyways, how about the Flying Disc?”</p><p>“I got two issues to tell you. First is the situation related to this Flying Disc. Professor Mo conducted his research day and night and his team has finally produced results. Further, I’ve already assigned people to buy a large number of raw materials and am now preparing for its mass production.”</p><p>“What about the second issue, then?” asked Tang Xiu.</p><p>“My former mentor, the younger brother of House Rothschild’s Patriarch, Yabro Rothschild, came to China and visited our Magnificent Tang Corp. for the purpose of establishing a partnership with us,” said Kang Xia.”</p><p>Tang Xiu squinted his eyes. He had heard of this legendary family countless times. This family was one of the largest and most terrifyingly powerful entities in the whole world with wealth that could definitely be rivaled by rich countries. It was even likely that most countries paled in comparison.</p><p>“Can you elaborate?” continued Tang Xiu in a very calm tone.</p><p>“What I can tell from Yabro Rothschild is that he offers the cooperation proposal through several means,” explained Kang Xia. “First, they will buy the core formula of our company’s products with each priced at 20 billion US dollars. Second, obtaining an exclusive right to be our representative agency in all countries all over the world—although they only listed a total of 10 countries at the moment aside from China—all of which are the top 10 countries in the world. Third, they offered a sky-high price of 120 billion US dollars for a full acquisition of our Magnificent Tang Corporation.”</p><p>Tang Xiu couldn’t help laughing after hearing it. He replied, “What a great sincerity, huh. His offer even makes me a bit excited. But then again, the Magnificent Tang Corporation is the foundation of our development, so a full acquisition is impossible, and the other two proposals are not an option either. However, I’m under the impression that there should be a fourth option, right?”</p><p>“You’re smart, Boss!” Kang Xia praised. “The fourth option proposed by Yabro Rothschild is the exclusive right to build a sales network in every country all over the world, including establishing specialty stores in every city in each country. This forms the most direct cooperation where we will provide them our products with a ratio of 3:7 for the sales and profit-sharing.”</p><p>“3:7?” Tang Xiu slightly furrowed his brows and coolly asked, “3 for us and 7 for them?”</p><p>“Correct.” Kang Xia confirmed.</p><p>“What a big appetite they have, heh,” Tang Xiu sneered.</p><p>“Do you find this way of cooperation disagreeable?” asked Kang Xia after hesitating.</p><p>“I can agree to this kind of cooperation, but the ratio of profit must be 7 for us and 3 for them,” said Tang Xiu. “Inform Yabro Rothschild what I just said. And that’s final. You can discuss the specific cooperation details with them should they accept, but tell them to go back to where they come from if they don’t accept it. <em>Hmph</em> , there are many big families with strong capital in the world. I’m sure countless families will come running to us and feel happy to negotiate with us with this kind of cooperation.”</p><p>“Well, then I’ll talk to him as per your instructions,” said Kang Xia seriously. “Shortly put, we’ll cooperate if he accepts the condition, and we’ll drop it off if he doesn’t.”</p><p>“One other issue, though. What about the effect of the new employees you’ve trained?” asked Tang Xiu.</p><p>“I’ve carried out your instructions and we now have a total of 5,000 new employees, all of whom have undergone the most intensive training possible, and are now ready to work at any time.” Kang Xia chuckled and said, “Further, we’ve just started the second phase of personnel training, so we can expect to see results in three months. And we’ll have about 10,000 people as reserve personnel by then. The number may be still far from the expected figure we need to enter the world business stage that we’re about to open, but I think it should be enough for a short period of time.”</p><p>“I see,” said Tang Xiu. “Then we’ll hold a job recruitment fair for every quarter annually. Each fair will recruit 5,000 people, so we can train 20,000 staff per year. Even if Yabro Rothschild does accept the profit-sharing ratio I’ve proposed, all the exclusive specialty stores must have some employees of our Magnificent Tang Corporation assigned there. Additionally, we will also be managing the financial aspect.”</p><p>“I think they will still agree to it, though,” said Kang Xia with a smile.</p><p>“Ehh? Where does your confidence come from?” asked Tang Xiu curiously.</p><p>“Well, House Rothschild runs a lot of huge banks all over the world. Once the products of the Magnificent Tang Corp go global, the amount of capital in circulation will be astronomical. I’m quite sure this House will never turn down or miss such an enormous resource.” Kang Xia chuckled.</p><p>Tang Xiu understood in a flash. As his mind moved, ideas rapidly grew in his mind, though he quickly cast them away a few seconds after and sighed inwardly. <em>‘It’s a pity my current capital I is too little, so I can’t compete with those world-class financial giants! Otherwise, I could’ve built the largest banking system all over the world myself. At that time, most of the world’s capital chain would be under my control. That would really make me under no one and above hundreds of millions of others.’</em></p><p>“Anyhow, I’m going back to Nine Dragons Island first, Kang Xia. You can contact me at any time, so let’s keep in touch. Once you’ve negotiated and reached an agreement with Yabro Rothschild, contact me at once regardless of the results. I’ll return to Star City in the near future should they accept it.” Tang Xiu concluded.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
