He couldn’t spare time to comfort her and just strode past her to see the unconscious Andy in the guest room.</p><p>“Don’t let anyone disturb me.”</p><p>After issuing this order, he grabbed Andy’s wrist and checked her pulse, only to find out that she had overdosed on medicinal pills. Her body that was unable to withstand the potent energy from the pills was eventually out of control. Her pulse now was very chaotic, while her True Essence was in utter disorder. If she didn’t get timely treatment to unclog the energy flow, even if the predicament wouldn’t kill her, the only choice was to scatter her cultivation for her to fully recover.</p><p>.She’s so foolish and just messing around, isn’t she?.</p><p>Tang Xiu smiled wryly and loosened Andy’s pulse and wrist. He shook his head, sighed inwardly and then lifted her from the bed. After making her sit cross-legged, he began to manipulate and adjust the chaotic True Essence in her meridians. Luckily, her cultivation was still weak at the mid-stage of Foundation Establishment—otherwise, Tang Xiu would’ve been really at a loss as to how to help her recuperate and adjust her physical condition.</p><p>Time fleeted by. In the last six hours, Tang Xiu spent a lot of energy to help Andy adjust her condition. After helping her lie down, he then left the room.</p><p>“How is she?” Kang Xia, who kept waiting outside the room, hurriedly asked.</p><p>“Her condition has stabilized.” Tang Xiu nodded. “She’ll be fine. And it won’t be a problem after she wakes up and recuperates. It wasn’t because of qi deviation, though. She took pills that are way too potent for her and got overdosed. Such pills are not something she can bear with her current cultivation level, thus causing this problem.”</p><p>“Ehh? She got overdosed?”</p><p>Kang Xia’s restlessness finally dissipated, yet she looked speechless and wore a strange expression after hearing Tang Xiu’s explanation.</p><p>Tang Xiu let out a smile and reached over her shoulder. “You got so rich recently, didn’t you? Well, don’t burn your money on pills even if you got more money. She’s quite lucky this time and no danger to her life, but if she takes another high-grade pill, her body could explode from the potent energy.”</p><p>Kang Xia smilingly said, “We got quite a fortune recently, indeed. Haven’t you checked your account balance?”</p><p>“Got too many things to tackle abroad recently, so I really haven’t checked my account.” Tang Xiu looked dull, before shaking his head and saying, “Anyways, what exactly happened? Where did we get so much money from?”</p><p>With an expression of being at a loss whether she had to cry or laugh, Kang Xia said, “I know money is nothing but a number to you. If anything, the products of our Magnificent Tang Corporation are booming and the supply never meets the demand. But I allocated all the income from the products into the company headquarter project in Shanghai. But don’t forget about the insider purchase of the New City. The real estate’s price of the New Metro is about there-odd times higher than its previous opening price, and half of them have been sold already as of now.”</p><p>“I’ve asked about the New Metro’s real estate issue back when it was at the early stage, though I no longer follow its later-stage development. How much was the capital invested by our company in the early stage?” asked Tang Xiu curiously.</p><p>Kang Xia stretched out a finger and then extended two more. After laughing, she asked, “Guess how many?”</p><p>“12 billion yuan?” Tang Xiu confirmed in amazement.</p><p>“Smart. No wonder you’re really the man I chose, huh!” Kang Xia praised while giving him a thumbs up. “That’s right. The total capital we invested to purchase the real estate in the previous phase was 12 billion yuan. Be it the residential or commercial establishments, the total market value has reached about 40 billion yuan. Most of the residential estates have been sold out for a total of 18.5 billion yuan, and I’ve transferred 15 billion into your private account. 3 billion went into the Magnificent Tang Corporation’s public account, and the remaining 500 million yuan are dividends.”</p><p>“It seems that the real estate business is indeed very lucrative.” Tang Xiu sighed. “It’s no surprise that most of the richest people in the country consisted mostly of real estate developers in the past. Anyways, what about the current progress of the new metro?”</p><p>“The first phase of the development project has been finalized and we’re currently finishing some miscellaneous works,” answered Kang Xia. “Most of the works for the second phase have been done and it’s expected to be fully finished by early next year. The third and fourth phases of the project have already started and, once the second phase has been fully finalized, it’s possible to carry out the third and fourth phases at the same time. The documents issued by the government also pointed out that we’re fully authorized to develop the New Metro while the government will provide assistance. Long Hanwen has been wanting to meet you recently, but he couldn’t contact you, unfortunately. Hence, he could only give up for the time being.”</p><p>“What did he want?” asked Tang Xiu.</p><p>“It’s about architectural complex design. Did you forget you were the one who designed it?” Kang Xia forced a smile and said, “That’s the main reason why the sales are so good and the very cause why rich celebrities all over the country ran over to buy these real estates. The architectural design and the buildings in the new city are highly acclaimed and the metro is said to be a dream city. But you’re always the so-busy-man and only designed the first and second phase of the project. You haven’t even mentioned the third and fourth phases until now. Long Hanwen is not the only one worrying about it, even I’m a bit restless here.”</p><p>“Did the government really give the full authority to us?” Tang Xiu frowned and asked, “Are they really unwilling to be involved, like, at all?”</p><p>“They must be involved, of course, but things like this are always very complicated. But Long Hanwen and the various parties are dealing with the government, so our company is much more relaxed,” said Kang Xia.</p><p>“I see.” Tang Xiu nodded and asked again, “How large is the area of the new city occupied by the first four phases of the construction project?”</p><p>“About one-fifth,” answered Kang Xia.</p><p><em>Cough, cough…</em></p><p>Being at a loss whether he had to cry or laugh, Tang Xiu looked at Kang Xiu and said, “The first four phases of the project only occupied one-fifth of the entire new city? Doesn’t it mean I still have to design tons of architectural blueprints?”</p><p>“You also know capable men must do most of the work, no?” Kang Xiu grinned and said, “Besides, it’s a joint venture and we can get most of the profits with the cheapest means, so work hard to increase our fortune, got it?”</p><p>Tang Xiu couldn’t help but shake his head helplessly. Luckily, the complete architectural design didn’t need to be drawn all at once. He could do the design for the next two phases of the project and it would be enough to tackle the situation—otherwise, he would rather put all the things at hand for a while and just devote himself into drawing the architectural designs.</p><p>Speaking about it, he may have to spend some time, but the cost of drawing building cells and blocks were not that much either. After all, he had countless buildings in the Immortal World as a reference, and drawing the designs was very easy since he could just plagiarize the suitable buildings for the purpose.</p><p>At the corner of the corridor.</p><p>Su Lingyun appeared in an apron. As she saw Tang Xiu and Kang Xia conversing and looking very intimate, she suddenly let out a smile and asked, “How about Andy’s treatment, Xiu’er?”</p><p>Tang Xiu loosened Kang Xia and approached her, saying, “She’ll be fine, Mom. She’ll recover after she wakes up and recuperates for a few days. Also, isn’t there a housekeeper to help you at home, Mom? Why are you cooking?”</p><p>“Why shouldn’t I cook personally since my son is at home?” asked Su Lingyun back smilingly. “I asked Xiaxia this afternoon and she hasn’t had any meals for two days. Perhaps she’ll have the appetite now that Andy is going to be fine, so Xiaxia must be starving now, no?”</p><p>‘Uh, Xiaxia?’</p><p>Tang Xiu stared at Kang Xia with an odd gaze. ‘When did they get so close and what exactly does Mom mean by saying so?’</p><p>The person in question just squinted at Tang Xiu and blushed. She quickly walked to Su Lingyun, swiftly held her hand, and said with a smile, “I’m not that hungry, Auntie.”</p><p>Su Lingyun smilingly said, “Why are you that shy, child? You’ll be the daughter-in-law of the Tang Family sooner or later, to begin with, so why can’t you eat more? Besides, I can only count on you to give me a healthy and chubby grandson earlier.”</p><p>“Guh…?!”</p><p>Tang Xiu was utterly dumbfounded, for he didn’t think that his mother had known all along about the state of the relationship between him and Kang Xia. To think that she was expecting to have a healthy and chubby grandson from Kang Xia… Wasn’t that already making it clear that Mu Wanying was the woman he’d properly marry in the future? Did she really approve of him having many women at the same time?</p><p>He really couldn’t figure out what his mother was thinking at all. After secretly shaking his head, he smiled and said, “Well, it seems that Andy needs some time to wake up, so let’s eat first! I was quite busy this afternoon, so I’m a bit starving now. Do you cook a delicious meal, Mom?”</p><p>“No worries, Kid. Mom has prepared everything you love to eat!” replied Su Lingyun smilingly.</p><p>During dinner, when Su Lingyun wasn’t paying attention, Tang Xiu quietly whispered to Kang Xia next to him, “Hey, since when did you get so close to my Mom? It seems she has been treating you as the Tang Family’s daughter-in-law already.”</p><p>Kang Xia’s mouth curved and she whispered back smilingly, “Auntie often comes to the company in recent months and brings me meals, you know. We occasionally invite each other and go shopping together too.”</p><p>“Ehh? What’s the catch?” Tang Xiu was confused.</p><p>“Well, it was because of the company dinner for executives six months ago, so we kinda chose your family’s restaurant for the party! After having some drinks, I was preparing to go home and rest, but then bumped into your Mom when she was moving some things. She got strained and I hurriedly carried her to a nearby Chinese medicine clinic. The old doctor then treated Auntie and we just hit it off and meet more often since.”</p><p>“I see.” Tang Xiu quickly understood and smilingly said, “Well, I never thought that you’d make such a smart move to fawn upon your future mother-in-law. Mom will definitely love you so much even if you can’t get the official status of the Tang Family’s daughter-in-law in the future, no?”</p><p>“Bah! Go! Go! ”</p><p>Out of shyness, Kang Xia hurriedly flung her face to the side to avoid being teased by Tang Xiu. She was well aware that she wouldn’t be the Tang Family’s daughter-in-law nominally. Countless times had she reminded herself that she didn’t need such status publicly and it was enough for her as long as Tang Xiu really had her in his heart.</p><p>Hence, although she felt slightly at a loss upon hearing such words from Tang Xiu, she was able to quickly adjust her mood.</p><p>Suddenly, Kang Xia turned back and whispered, “What’s with those five little guys, though? They are kinda odd, like some robots or something. So very disciplined and yet old-fashioned at the same time. I thought they were like other average children, not like some old geezers.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
