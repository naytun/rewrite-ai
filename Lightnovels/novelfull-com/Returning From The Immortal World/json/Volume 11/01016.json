Even the princess of the Ouyangs, Lulu, must call her elder cousin. It was just natural that she knew Guo Fugui’s identity.</p><p>Still, she couldn’t imagine how would this waiter’s sister had the guts to provoke Guo Fugui.</p><p>After being silent for a few seconds, Ouyang Yun slowly said, “Your sister has offended Guo Fugui and has been forced to hide. But you’re one of Paradise Club’s people, so you don’t need to fear any retaliation from him.”</p><p>“I can’t, General Manager.” Yang Fei shook his head and said, “Big Sis is the only relative I have left. There’s no way I can leave her alone. Please approve my resignation.”</p><p>“Haih.” Ouyang Yun sighed. “Then I agree since you insist on leaving. Go inside and hand over your resignation, then…”</p><p>Suddenly, she stopped talking and a quaint expression appeared on her face. She then shook her head and sighed again. “I think it’s impossible for you to leave now. There are at least ten of Guo Fugui’s men in the surroundings and they are quite powerful hunting dogs. Even that ruthless Earth Mole person came.”</p><p>Yang Fei immediately turned his head and found his sister Yang Yan looking panicked, running toward him. He glanced around and saw that a few figures had appeared in the illuminated spot. Two men were walking behind his sister with seething killing intent.</p><p>“Little Fei, leave quickly!”</p><p>Yang Yan frantically pulled out a fruit knife from his bag and hurriedly called out while running.</p><p>“I can’t, Sis.” Yang Fei shook his head and said, “Be it a fortune or misfortune, we can’t avoid the calamity if it’s meant to come. But rest assured for I will never let them harm you as long as I’m still standing. General Manager, I’m grateful for your agreeing to my resignation. I’m not Paradise Club’s staff now. I hope that we siblings won’t cause trouble for you.”</p><p>“Just Guo Fugui alone is not enough to bring trouble to me,” Ouyang Yun disdainfully said. “But what about you? Have you clearly thought about it? Once you leave Paradise Club, the next thing awaits you is only death that will have nothing to do with us.”</p><p>For a moment, Yang Fei was silent, before he replied with a bitter face, “I understand about the custom, General Manager. Whether I live or die today, it’s not related to you anymore.”</p><p>Having said that, he snatched the fruit knife in Yang Yan’s hand and pulled her behind him as he coldly watched the two men striding towards them.</p><p>Watching his actions, Ouyang Yun somehow felt a bit regretful. She shook her head and inwardly sighed. She appreciated Yang Fei’s courage and uprightness, but her Ouyang Family and Guo Fugui had never interfered with each other and she didn’t want to cause any conflict between them, even though her side was not afraid of him.</p><p>“Ms. Ouyang.”</p><p>A black-suited middle-aged man with a scar on his face only glanced at Yang Yan and Yang Fei before greeting her a bit respectfully.</p><p>“Earth Mole, you guys rarely show up in the middle of the night for no reason,” replied Ouyang Yun smilingly. “You brought so many people here today, do you want to provoke us or is there something else?”</p><p>“Ms. Ouyang is mistaken. I dare not bring my men to provoke you even if I got more courage.” The scar-faced man shook his head and said, “I came here for this bitch. She has injured our brothers, so I’ll take her back and hand her over to our Boss.”</p><p>“Looking at her, she doesn’t have any strength to even unfeather a chicken, how would she able to cause any harm to your people? Aren’t you mistaken about something here?” asked Ouyang Yun with a smile.</p><p>“We’ve investigated it clearly, Ms. Ouyang. She’s the one who has injured one of our brothers, and cruelly at that.” The scar-faced man shook his head and said, “My brother is now being hospitalized and probably will have to live in a wheelchair for the rest of his life. Is she… is she one of your people?”</p><p>With a look of surprise, Ouyang Yun gazed at Yang Yan before shaking her head. “She isn’t related to my Ouyang clan at all, and I won’t meddle in the affairs between you all. But know it well, this place belongs to the Ouyangs. Please leave if you must resolve your private conflict.”</p><p>The scar-faced man nodded and shot a grim look at Yang Fei, coldly saying, “You must be Yang Fei, Yang Yan’s younger brother, right, Kid? We’ve investigated you siblings. Please follow us now!”</p><p>Yang Fei took a deep breath as his hand reached out to grab Yang Yan’s hand, saying in a deep voice, “Alright, we’ll go with you.”</p><p>Ouyang Yun just looked at their backs as they left. She secretly shook her head since she was well aware that once Yang Yan and Yang Fei left with this Earth Mole fella, it was nearly impossible for them to survive. However, she had seen too many of such a death struggles to count ever since she took over the Paradise Club and couldn’t care less to involve herself in this matter.</p><p>Tut, tut, tut…</p><p>Text incoming sounds suddenly rang from her mobile phone. As she took it out and opened the MMS, a surprised look was suddenly cast on her beautiful face, because the photo on the message was Yang Yan who just left before.</p><p>It’s strange really!</p><p>She muttered and was about to dial the number that sent the MMS when her phone suddenly rang. It was exactly the number that just sent the MMS.</p><p>“What’s the matter?” asked Ouyang Yun.</p><p>After a short while listening, she hung up and shouted an order, “Stop them immediately! Take the woman named Yang Yan and bring her to me!”</p><p>In a flash, eight stalwart men rushed toward the people who brought Yang Yan and Yang Fei and were just tens of meters away. Upon seeing that they were blocked off, the scar-faced man pulled out a Mitsubishi army knife and watched Ouyang Yun approaching step by step with his snake-like eyes.</p><p>“Ms. Ouyang, what’s the meaning of this?”</p><p>While shaking the mobile phone in her hand, Ouyang Yun wore a helpless expression as she replied, “I didn’t want to meddle in your business before, but I got a call from the seniors in the clan to find her, so I have no choice but to take action.”</p><p>She then pointed at Yang Yan.</p><p>The scar-faced man frowned and asked, “What did she do? Did she also provoke your Ouyang Family?”</p><p>“I don’t think I need to explain to you about what she did, do I?” Ouyang Yun shook her head and said, “You just need to know that she’s very important to me since someone has asked my Ouyang Family to guarantee her safety. Well, off you go fellas.”</p><p>“Ms. Ouyang! Are you saying you want to go against our custom?!” roared the scar-faced man. “She has harmed my brother and my Boss has commanded me to capture her, yet you actually want to protect her? Is it worth it to go to such lengths to make my Boss unhappy?”</p><p>“Heh, why wouldn’t I dare to make your Boss unhappy, huh?” Ouyang Yun’s complexion turned cold and she sneered at the man. “Even if we must tear all decorum with your Boss, what about it? Do you think the Ouyang Family fears Guo Fugui and can do nothing to him? Scram. Otherwise, don’t blame me for being impolite!”</p><p>The scar-faced man was furious inwardly, yet he suppressed all the anger deep down since he knew Ouyang Yun’s identity. He turned to look at Yang Yan and said in a heavy voice, “You’re damned, bitch. You’re lucky the Ouyang is protecting you. But just wait and hope they can protect you forever… if not… hmph!”</p><p>Yang Yan and Yang Fei had been despairing a moment ago, as only a tragic end waited for them after they fell into Guo Fugui’s hands. Never did they ever expect that Ouyang Yun would suddenly intervene.</p><p>Yang Yan watched the scar-faced man leave with the rest. Only fater their figures disappeared did she retract her vision. She then turned to look at Ouyang Yun, looking somewhat uneasy as she spoke, “Ms. Ouyang, thank you…”</p><p>“You don’t need to thank me. I just got a call that someone is looking for you. I’ve sent the message back that I’ve found you and I believe that some people will come over soon,” said Ouyang Yun vaguely. “Anyway, you’re to wait here until they come to fetch you, so I won’t have anything to do with you anymore.”</p><p>“Who are these people?” asked Yang Yan hurriedly.</p><p>“I don’t know either.” Ouyang Yun shook her head.</p><p>****</p><p>On the coastal road, a black car speedily moved towards the Everlasting Feast Hall’s headquarters. The one who was driving it, Chi Nan, suddenly had her expression shift. She put on her earphones and picked up the call. After listening to the caller and conversed for a few moments, she said, “Thank you. Please wait for a moment.”</p><p>She took away the earphones afterward and spoke, “The woman has been found, Boss. She’s in the Bay Port and had been caught by her enemy just now. I sent the news that we’re searching for her half an hour ago, and the Ouyang’s intelligence division kinda helped us greatly this time.”</p><p>The Bay Port? Tang Xiu knitted his brows and asked, “How far is it from here to the Bay Port?”</p><p>“Not far, about 10 minutes driving,” answered Chi Nan.</p><p>“Then head to the Bay Port first,” ordered Tang Xiu.</p><p>“Roger that!”</p><p>Ten minutes later, they arrived at Bay Port. Tang Xiu saw through the window and had already seen the situation in the surroundings. His attention was especially focused on Yang Yan, who stood next to Ouyang Yun. He could recognize her at a glance.</p><p>Ouyang Yun led four middle-aged men, approaching the car in strides. She wanted to know what kind of bigshot could move the person in charge of the Ouyang’s intel division to help him.</p><p>After Mo Awu got out of the car, he indifferently glanced around and then walked to the back to open the rear door. An astonished look appeared on Ouyang Yun’s face upon seeing Tang Xiu come out of the car.</p><p>Isn’t it Tang Xiu? The owner of Magnificent Tang Corporation and the future son-in-law of the Ouyang family? How could it be him?</p><p>She strode a few steps towards Tang Xiu’s and smilingly said, “Hello, Mr. Tang. I’m Ouyang Yun, Lulu’s older cousin.”</p><p>Tang Xiu shook hands with her and smiled. “Nice to meet you, Sister Yun. It seems I’ve troubled you this time.”</p><p>At his words, Ouyang Yun shook her head and smiled. “Not really. Today’s incident is just an accident. Yet I never thought that the person who’s looking for Yang Yan was actually you, though.”</p><p>“I was entrusted to find and help a woman named Yang Yan by someone,” said Tang Xiu with a chuckle. “Also, Sis Yu. You’re Lulu’s older cousin, so we’re related. Please don’t call me, Mr. Tang. Just call me Tang Xiu directly.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
