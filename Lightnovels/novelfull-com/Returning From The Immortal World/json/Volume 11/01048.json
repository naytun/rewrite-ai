Inside the innermost room, two rows of LCD screens displayed various patterns and data with many people stroking the keyboards in front of them and occasionally engaging in conversations.</p><p>Wei Changsheng was sitting on the sofa in the corner while quietly reading the information in his hand. As one of the heads of the intelligence department, the recent troublesome case had caused him quite a headache. Even though most of the Fan Family members were now under custody, the progress of the interrogations was very difficult.</p><p>“Chief.”</p><p>A burly man came towards him in big strides. On his cold face was a bit of a helpless look, and his voice seemed a bit different.</p><p>“What’s up?” asked Wei Changsheng as he looked up and frowned.</p><p>“That girl has been crying for a day and hasn’t touched any food and drink. She doesn’t have any sleep either,” said the burly man helplessly. “What should we do? Should we just send her to the detention center, or…”</p><p>At his report, Wei Changsheng slammed the documents in his hand on the table and yelled, “If it wasn’t for that wench, the major case in the capital wouldn’t have been exposed! No matter how it looks, I’ll never believe that such a coincidence can happen in the world. There’s no way she can be at such an excellent position when the Fan clansmen committed the massacre in the downtown area.”</p><p>“We’ve checked out everything. She hails from an ordinary family and her profession is an anchor of a live broadcast platform, no less. I believe you’re also crystal clear with our interrogation methods, Chief. It’s simply impossible for her to hide any secrets with her personality.” The big man said, “It’s very likely that she was at the spot by chance and began her live broadcast directly.”</p><p>“I don’t give a fuck about that!” Wei Changsheng angrily said, “Even if she was there by chance, we must still detain her! This is a big and sensational case, and yet she spread it out on the Internet! Do you know how much impact and troubles she has caused us? Later on, I’ll assign some people to scrutinize all those broadcasting platforms carefully, and block them if there are any violations!”</p><p>“About that…”</p><p>The big man hesitated and finally nodded with a bitter smile. The Chief’s command in this place held much more say than even the Heaven’s. It was useless to argue with him since he had already made up his mind. If there was somebody to blame, it was that wench herself. Broadcasting many things were not wrong, but why must she broadcast such a serious case on the Internet? One must know that even the state had blocked news of this case, yet she just planted the bomb and pushed it up to cause such a big mess.</p><p>Suddenly, the intercom in the big man’s hand rang. A voice of a soldier who was in charge to block the road was then heard. “Captain, we got a comrade requesting to see to Chief Wei.”</p><p>The stalwart man was stunned. He glanced at Wei Changsheng and asked, “Which comrade?”</p><p>“He claims to be Tang Xiu and he has a credential of our Security Department.”</p><p>“Tang Xiu?” The man slightly furrowed his brows since the name sounded familiar to him.</p><p>Wei Changsheng, who was still sitting on the sofa, looked surprised. He immediately got up and said, “Our great hero turns out to be here! He belongs to our department, but it’s his first time reporting here. Let him in.”</p><p>“Understood!”</p><p>After five-odd minutes, Tang Xiu came into the backyard of the quadrangle building. As he saw Wei Changsheng greet him with a beaming face and extended his hand cordially, he let out a smile and said, “You’re Chief Wei, right? Tang Xiu is reporting to you.”</p><p>“I’ve long heard about you, Tang Xiu.” We Changsheng chuckled and said, “I know all members of our security department, but you’re the only one I’m not acquainted with.”</p><p>“Well, Chief Wei must forgive me about that.” Tang Xiu chuckled and said, “I have too many things at hand, so that’s why I’ve never reported here.”</p><p>“A man with great talent and abilities in the country such as you must be very busy. Let’s spare the small talk, shall we? It’s great that you can come here at this time.” Wei Changsheng laughed and said again, “Anyways, it was very fortunate that you were present when that big case occurred, though. I already learned from our superiors that it was your men that dealt with those murderers, right? That’s great. You all deserve to be the people of our security department!”</p><p>“That’s pretty much overpraising, Chief Wei. It’s nothing but my duty and responsibility,” said Tang Xiu with a smile.</p><p>“No arrogance and modest without being servile. That’s great,” said Wei Changsheng with a nod. “Anyways, Tang Xiu. If memory serves, today is the 80th birthday of Elderly Tang, right? I got too many things at hand recently, so I can’t attend and congratulate Senior Tang in person. I can only assign some men to send my regards. Well, why did you come here today though? Is there something else you have in mind?”</p><p>“Frankly speaking, I have two main purposes in coming here today, Chief Wei,” replied Tang Xiu smilingly. “Firstly, is to meet you and report to you. Secondly, is about that rash girl. I hope you can give her some leniency. I’ll educate her well so she won’t cause such trouble ever again.”</p><p>Wei Changsheng stared blankly for a moment before he instantly understood the purpose of Tang Xiu’s arrival today. Still, there was a bit of a strange look on his face as he inquired, “You know this Tian Xiaomeng lass?”</p><p>“To my bad luck, I’m indeed acquainted with her, I guess.” Tang Xiu forced a smile and said, “She was the one who reported several matters I did before. I wouldn’t have been exposed to the public eyes otherwise.”</p><p>“Huh?” Wei Changsheng was surprised and said, “The way I get it, you don’t want to be famous?”</p><p>“Just like pigs dread being fat, fame will only portend trouble for me,” said Tang Xiu with a helpless face. “I’ve always intended to keep a low-profile, but who would’ve thought that this girl had secretly made her scoop about me without my permission. I know that she had no bad intentions. What she has been promoting is all the positive energy she could broadcast all the time, so I can’t blame her even if it’s against my will.”</p><p>Wei Changsheng nodded. After pondering for a while, he then said, “I was going to give that lass a lesson, at least shut her in detention for 15 days, so that she can take the lesson well. However, since you’re advocating for her, then I’ll drop it. You can take her away, but keep in mind to educate her well to let her know what can be reported and what cannot.”</p><p>With a face full of assurance, Tang Xiu complied. “No worries. I’ll educate her well about that. That’s right, Chief Wei. Do you like to drink? I got a nice wine here, would you like me to sell you two bottles of it?”</p><p>Staring blankly for a moment, Wei Changsheng immediately smiled and said, “Is it the Gods Nectar?”</p><p>Tang Xiu took out the Gods Nectar from the interspatial ring and handed it over to Wei Changsheng with a smile. “That will be two yuan. I hope Chief Wei doesn’t mind me collecting the money.”</p><p>‘Two yuan? That’s funny!’</p><p>Wei Changsheng’s lips curled upward and a smile crept up his face. He slipped his hand into his pocket and found some money. But the smallest bill was five yuan, so he just gave it to Tang Xiu and grinningly said, “Well, I don’t mind buying three more if you have it. Our security department has many people who love drinking you know.”</p><p>Tang Xiu grinned back and took out three more bottles of God’s Nectar from the interspatial ring. Then, he said, “Well, since Chief Wei and the other comrades like the Gods Nectar, just directly contact Kang Xia. I’ll tell her about it in advance.”</p><p>Wei Changsheng squinted his eyes, watching Tang Xiu take out the Gods Nectar out of thin air. He had faintly noticed something. To verify upon his guess, he asked in a whisper, “Hey, Tang Xiu. Duanmu Lin told me that you’re a cultivator. So, the thing you used to store these Gods Nectar must be an object unique to cultivators like you, right?”</p><p>“Yeah, it’s an interspatial ring,” answered Tang Xiu without hesitation. “The space is not bad and it can store some Gods Nectar. Pity that the country has regulations that we can’t gift presents to superiors, though. I would’ve gifted you ten boxes of God’s Nectar otherwise as a show of filial piety, Chief Wei!”</p><p>“Bwahaha…” Wei Changsheng burst into laughter and said, “No need for ten boxes. One or two boxes are enough for me. You’re great, Tang Xiu! I like you even though this is our first meeting, young man! I believe you got a great future ahead of you.”</p><p>“I take your words as a blessing and I’ll surely work hard for it,” said Tang Xiu with a smile.</p><p>Nodding with a smile in response, Wei Changsheng asked again, “Are you ready to take the girl away now, or…”</p><p>“I’ll take her away now since I’m going home to congratulate Grandpa on his birthday,” Tang Xiu said. “Also, I’ll be sure to invite you to drink and report my work to you whenever I got some spare time, Chief Wei.”</p><p>“Okay! Senior Tang’s birthday cannot be held without the presence of his cherished grandson now, can it? Be sure to come here more often,” Wei Changsheng smilingly said.</p><p>“Got it!”</p><p>Tang Xiu replied and followed the burly man towards the partial room in the front courtyard. When the door was pushed away from the outside, sobbing was heard from the inside. Tang Xiu let out a smile and came inside as he saw the single bed in the corner and Tian Xiaomeng shrinking in the corner of the bed, crying.</p><p>“Well, have you learned your lesson now, girl?”</p><p>Tian Xiaomeng looked up with a teary face. She was stunned upon seeing Tang Xiu, crying out “WOW” and cried again as though venting all the grievances. At the same time, she struggled to stand up from the corner of the bed and jumped out to rush into Tang Xiu’s arms.</p><p>The burly man just stood at the door, looking at Tang Xiu and Tian Xiaomeng with a strange expression. At this moment, he straightly misunderstood Tian Xiaomeng as Tang Xiu’s girlfriend after seeing how close the relationship between the two was.</p><p>Tang Xiu himself could feel Tian Xiaomeng’s emotions. He hugged and patted her back and smilingly said, “Hey, aren’t you a big girl already? Stop crying so bitterly, would you? I told you before that you know nothing about how serious the matter is, didn’t I? Yet you still dared to broadcast that kind of scene. It doesn’t matter how many years you have, you won’t be let off lightly for it.”</p><p>Tian Xiaomeng slightly shuddered. She tried hard to stop her crying and her face was ghastly pale. With a stuttering voice, she asked, “I… I-I’m g-gonna b-be j-jailed?”</p><p>Inwardly, Tang Xiu felt so funny and pinched her nose hard, saying, “You should’ve been sent to prison for a few years to renovate yourself already. But since I’m here, I can naturally save you. But you’re forbidden from carelessly making any rash live broadcasts in the future. I will no longer be able to save you even if I sell my face again, you got that?”</p><p>Tian Xiaomeng understood Tang Xiu’s meaning and gratefully nodded, but her eyes still couldn’t stop the tears from coming out.</p><p>At this moment, in Tian Xiaomeng’s heart, Tang Xiu was not only her idol but was elevated to her patron saint that could give her a sense of security.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
