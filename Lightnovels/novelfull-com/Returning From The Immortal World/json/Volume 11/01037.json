Their bodies began cracking as though lands that struck by drought. Blood fluttered and rushed into the disc-shaped array and gradually, the entire sky was painted blood red.</p><p>It was the forbidden art! The most dreadful and unfathomable art belonging to the Demon Praecantator Clan was being displayed at this moment. The blood pillar extended downward from the disc-shaped array, covering Chen Zhizhong underneath as ancient and primitive runes poured and flowed into his body.</p><p>“Ugh… ROAR…”</p><p>The moment the blood column covered Chen Zhizhong, a sharp scream of pain came out of his mouth. Along with time, his screams turned into the likes of a beast’s roars due to the rending pain.</p><p>Standing outside the array, Tang Xiu just smilingly watched Chen Zhizhong’s pained and twisted face. Such an inheritance process brought along absolute pain, but the benefits gained after the pain was equally enormous.</p><p>He did consider getting the Demon Praecantator Clan’s inheritance himself, but he knew better. Once he chose to get it, he would never be able to continue cultivating the Heavenly Art of Cosmic Genesis—a case where the loss outweighed the gains. All things considered, once he achieved great success in the Heavenly Art of Cosmic Genesis, he would be infinitely stronger than the result he could get from the Demon Praecantator’s inheritance.</p><p>Immediately after, Tang Xiu sat cross-legged right where he stood. He released his perception to seep into the small world array. What he must do right now was to devote himself to comprehend this array. He wouldn’t have to do so prior to this and could’ve retreated with Chen Zhizhong.</p><p>But the current situation begged different measures. He must fully comprehend all the arrays in this place and then crack the array in front to rescue and take out Chen Zhizhong from the inside; even though he could leave by himself, his disciple would be trapped forever otherwise.</p><p>Time fleeted by and six days passed by in the blink of an eye.</p><p>When Tang Xiu opened his eyes, the blood column that shrouded Chen Zhizhong gradually disappeared from this piece of the world. But countless ancient and primitive runes surged toward Chen Zhizhong’s naked body like tidal waves. Tang Xiu could even see those countless runes etching themselves in Chen Zhizhong’s muscles, viscera, and bones.</p><p>“It’s successful?”</p><p>Expectation and anticipation were evident in Tang Xiu’s eye. But when his sight shifted to the spot tens of meters high in the air, a look of sadness could be seen gleaming in his eyes. The hundreds of Diablo Praecantator clansmen now looked like dried out corpses suspended in the air, holding their one last breath and waiting for the inheritance process to complete.</p><p>At this moment, Discalceate Diabolos suddenly opened his eyes and only the shadow of death was visible in his eyes as he scrutinized Chen Zhizhong’s body. He was perfectly aware that his clan would not completely disappear from the world—with Chen Zhizhong inheriting their heritage and having his physique transformed, he was now the last seedling of their Diablo Praecantator Clan. In his bloodline now flowed the blood of his clansmen and within his soul now etched the insignia of Diablo Praecantator Clan. So long as he didn’t die, their clan would be able to take roo and a newly born Diablo Praecantator Clan would re emerge yet again.</p><p>“Your Excellency Tang Xiu, the disciple of Vermillion Bird Holy Sect. The promise has been fulfilled and grace has been requited. We’re about to vanish from this world, and it is our wish that you can save the seed of our clan. Shall he live for ten thousands of years for the days to come, and be extended shall the bloodlines of our Diablo Praecantator Clan,” said Discalceate Diabolos slowly.</p><p>Tang Xiu raised his right hand and placed it on his left chest, pledging. “Then I, Tang Xiu, shall vow to free my disciple from this place and lead him to infinite greatness. And shall be the bloodlines and fighting spirit of your Diablo Praecantator Clan to return to the Immortal World, and let your clan reclaim back your former glory in the countless years to come.”</p><p>“Thank you!”</p><p>The war blade reappeared in front of Discalceate Diabolos, followed by the reappearance of immortal weapons before the hundreds of his clansmen to end their own life.</p><p>“Return!” Discalceate Diabolos roared as he vanished.</p><p>“Return!”</p><p>“Return!”</p><p>“Return!”</p><p>Hundreds of Diablo Praecantator clansmen also roared as they picked up their own blades and hacked themselves. As flames burst from their bodies, the blazing flame began to burn them inside out until they were completely gone.</p><p>It was a pure and complete death! The uncommon death where the souls truly vanished into nothingness.</p><p>Chen Zhizhong slowly opened his eyes as two lines of tears streamed down his face, dripping down to his bronze chest and finally falling down to the earth beneath his feet.</p><p>He then kowtowed three times and prostrated nine times—the greatest salutation and homage a human could perform.</p><p>After finishing all those, Chen Zhizhong shifted his sight to Tang Xiu with a sorrowful face. After stopping before the transparent energy shield, he kowtowed to Tang Xiu three times and asked as he got up, “Why, Master?”</p><p>Tang Xiu knew what Chen Zhizhong was referring to. A complicated look filled his eyes. He shook his head and said, “I’m sure that I can crack this array and break this prison to free the Diablo Praecantator clansmen. They could have left this small world and come to a wonderful world outside.”</p><p>“Then why?” asked Chen Zhizhong again.</p><p>“You don’t know anything about them, nor do you know those of them who have cast the Life and Death Nightmare curse on themselves.” Tang Xiu shook his head and said, “Living for them is nothing but a torment—a never-ending pain and torture. Death is just their salvation, the best ending and the ultimate relief for them.”</p><p>“But as long as they’re alive, will not be hope for them in the future, Master?” Chen Zhizhong argued. “Who can be sure that no one can remove the curse they cast on themselves in the future? You’re someone omnipotent in my heart, you will definitely have the means to do so in the future.”</p><p>“Let’s not speak about the future and see what we must face at the present,” said Tang Xiu with a deep voice. “If I were to release and take them out of this small world to our Earth, do you think I can have them under control with their bloodthirst nature? With just humanity on Earth, can these Diablo Praecantator clansmen with Golden Immortal Stage cultivation be stopped? Only earth littered by corpses and rivers filled with blood remain should the fight between both sides occur.</p><p>“Keep in mind that what I just said is the best ending possible. If we must think about the bad ending, they can easily blow up the Earth, leading to the complete destruction of humanity and Earth. They can tear apart the spatial barrier with their power to another world and even find their way back to the Immortal World. But can you bear the fate of the Earth being destroyed and the end of humanity? Can you bear to just watch helplessly as your loved ones and family die in the hands of the Diablo Praecantator clansmen?”</p><p>Every word Tang Xiu said was powerfully spoken.</p><p>Chen Zhizhong was utterly stunned by Tang Xiu’s explanation. He just had a bit of wondering as to why Tang Xiu would deceive hundreds of Demon Praecantator clansmen. But now, he could understand it. It wasn’t that his Master didn’t want to save them, but the fact that he couldn’t bear the dreadful situation after he released them.</p><p>His tightly clenched fists loosened. Ashamed and uneasy were cast on his face as he knelt yet again before Tang Xiu. He recalled his Master’s last request to the Diablo Praecantator Clan. He remembered all the benefits he just obtained because of that request. The regret in his heart grew thicker as indebted and grateful feelings toward Tang Xiu crazily grew inside him.</p><p>“I’m sorry, Master.”</p><p>Tang Xiu’s complexion eased as he shook his head and said, “No apology needed. We are master and disciple, to begin with. In the brutal Immortal World, we only have two kinds of people we can call the closest and our own. The first one being all the blood-connected relatives, and the second one being similar to the relationship between fathers and sons—master and disciples. You’re my disciple, that means you’re my closest relative. Regardless of any mistakes you made, I’ll never blame you as long as its redeemable.”</p><p>Masters and disciples were such as fathers and sons!</p><p>The line was deeply etched into Chen Zhizhong’s heart and firmly engraved into his soul.</p><p>“Alright, get up now!” said Tang Xiu. “Now tell me, how far have you comprehended the inheritance of the Diablo Praecantator Clan, and how much benefits have you obtained?”</p><p>Chen Zhizhong stood up and cupped his fists again, saying, “Master, I don’t know how strong I am now, though I’m indeed much stronger than before. I have a feeling that even if there’s a hill before me, I can blow it up with just one punch.</p><p>Tang Xiu happily nodded and asked again, “What else?”</p><p>“Hundreds of Diablo Praecantator clansmen Seniors passed on all of their lifelong experience, heritage, and studies to me. The knowledge they passed to me is simply enormous, including their witchcraft, secret arts, and spellcasting. In a strict sense, I’m now one of them.”</p><p>“Very good.” Tang Xiu nodded and said, “You should be very clear about the commitment I made to the seniors of this clan. It is also my wish for you to regain back the former glory of the Diablo Praecantator Clan. Let all living beings know that the Diablo Praecantator Clan still exists instead of going extinct 100,000 years ago, be it immortals, demons, wizards, ghosts, monsters, spirits and deities. Keep living and live a good life. You’re my disciple whom I hope to be able to follow my footsteps who will also obtain infinite achievements and become a supreme being in the Immortal World. It is also my hope for you to have the opportunity to accompany me in the campaign in the higher plane that is God’s Realm.”</p><p>A great devotion filled Chen Zhizhong’s mind as he shouted, “I’ll definitely follow your footsteps through your campaign, Master. Be it in the Immortal World or God’s Realm. I, Chen Zhizhong, will forever be a disciple closest to you!”</p><p>Tang Xiu laughed loudly in response and then said, “Great! I was once a Supreme back in the Immortal World, and I’ll also become the Supreme in God’s Realm. You must not be worse than me as my disciple!”</p><p>“What?!”</p><p>Chen Zhizhong’s expression suddenly froze and disbelief filled his eyes. He looked at Tang Xiu and asked stutteringly, “M-Mas… Master, could you repeat what you just said? You said… y-you, you were once a Supreme in the Immortal World?”</p><p>“I won’t hide it from you anymore now that you’ve received the Diablo Praecantator Clan’s inheritance.” Tang Xiu nodded and said, “I had been once a Supreme in the Immortal World—a mighty expert who stood above the myriad races there. My enemies ambushed me, then I eventually crossed the plane and returned back to Earth. But keep in mind that you must not tell anyone about this matter, even your closest people. Otherwise, once the news that I’m still alive passes on to my several enemies who are also Supremes in the Immortal World, then you can expect that we’ll all die!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
