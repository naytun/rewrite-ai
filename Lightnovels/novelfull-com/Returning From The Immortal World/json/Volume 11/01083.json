Affection toward Xue Yue had grown inside him ever since she had shed her shyness and got along with him until now. Such a warm and emotional feeling made him feel very comfortable inside.</p><p>“A man may encounter misfortune, yet it may be an actual blessing.”</p><p>Tang Xiu turned and walked to the window. As he looked at the beautiful shade of trees and bouquets of flowers outside, he couldn’t help but sigh when a beautiful face suddenly came to his mind.</p><p>After Xue Yu followed and stood next to him, she asked with an odd expression, “What do you mean?”</p><p>“It’s nothing.” Tang Xiu smiled and shook his head. “Just something in the past not worth mentioning! Anyways, can I ask you something? And you must answer it seriously.”</p><p>Nodding with a thoughtful look, Xue Yu said, “Just ask. I’ll answer you truthfully.”</p><p>“Although you’ve now broken through to the Spirit Formation Stage and are one of the best experts on Earth, there’s something I’d like to ask you about our future.” Tang Xiu asked, “Do you really want to be just a woman by my side? Or the one who shares weal and woe with me in the campaign against the world?”</p><p>“That’s a very easy question to answer, actually.” Xue Yu suddenly stretched out a smile and replied, “I’ll always be with you wherever you go! I won’t be just a woman who’ll cook and wash your clothes, but I’ll also accompany you to face your enemies. I just don’t want to… to be at a loss whenever you’re in danger.”</p><p>Tang Xiu reached out to grab her fragrant shoulder, hugging her and whispering, “Since you chose the second option, then please help me train the children soldiers once we’re back to the Nine Dragons Island! I hope you can train a lot of Foundation Establishment and Golden Core Stage experts in the next few years.”</p><p>Xue Yu nodded and her eyes suddenly lit up. “The surviving demonic beasts in the Himalayas likely won’t be exterminated completely any time soon. If they are in hiding and breeding, their number may increase in the future. Since you want me to train those children, it’d be better for me to pick out the elites and take them into the depths of the Himalayas. I just realized from the training Yan’er gave me that one can only be truly strong after going through dangerous battles.”</p><p>“If anything, it won’t be only those demonic beasts in the depths of the Himalayas, but also the battlefields all over the world.” Tang Xiu smiled and added, “I want the shadow of the Tang Sect to be present in any wars that occur in the future. I can’t manage to handle it myself since my hands are full with too many issues I need to deal with this year. Not to mention that I need to carry out a big move starting next year. I want our Tang Sect’s strength to multiply by then, that even those Big Three organizations in the world must yield and retreat.”</p><p>“A big move? What is it?” asked Xue Yu.</p><p>“Let’s save that for later! You can see it soon enough,” replied Tang Xiu with a mystifying smile.</p><p>Xue Yu no longer asked. She had decided to support any decisions Tang Xiu made. She wouldn’t hesitate to follow him even if he told her that he wanted to be the king of the world.</p><p><em>Knock, knock…</em></p><p>The door was knocked and Kuwako’s voice was heard outside the door. “It’s me, Kuwako, Boss.”</p><p>Xue Yu turned and walked to the door. After opening it, she saw Kuwako standing straight outside in a black leather attire that highlighted her fine figure and showcased her delicate, beautiful face. Added with her long black hair, she looked very vigorous and valiant.</p><p>“Lady Boss.”</p><p>After witnessing Xue Yu’s power, deep respect had grown in Kuwako’s heart towards her. The other reason why she was this respectful was that she also knew that Xue Yu was Tang Xiu’s woman.</p><p>“Tang Xiu is inside if you wanna chat,” said Xue Yu with a smile.</p><p>After watching Xue Yu leave, Kuwako then entered the room. As she came behind Tang Xiu, she respectfully spoke, “Boss, Mo Awu said you’re looking for me?”</p><p>Tang Xiu turned around and looked at her, and couldn’t help but praise. “Well, I never thought you’d advance to the Golden Core Stage this fast. I took you in back then as a subordinate and originally intended to make you handle some issues for me as well as to secure cultivation resources from Japan. But now, it seems like I must cast away my previous intention. You’re a talented woman, and I always need talented people.”</p><p>Inwardly, Kuwako was secretly glad to receive the notification of Tang Xiu’s summon. Back when she received the notice to leave for China, she still felt that she was already very strong and was likely not far from Tang Xiu, even feeling confident that she would surpass him soon. But the battle in the Himalayas struck her with a realization that the chasm between her and Tang Xiu was not narrowed, but became bigger instead.</p><p>Such a discovery made her finally realize that Tang Xiu’s strength was far more than she could reach. Not only that, even the number of powerful subordinates under him was something that she could only look up to. It was the reason that she had a change of mind and completely submitted to Tang Xiu. She dared not to show dissent and disloyalty anymore.</p><p>Other than that, after she learned that Tang Xiu found Tang Sect and became its first Sect Master, she was full of expectation inwardly, hoping that she’d become a Tang Sect disciple and his true confidant. At this moment, she had a vague feeling that her wish would be granted.</p><p>“I have my own way of managing my men.” Tang Xiu continued, “The strong will rise and the weak will fall. I don’t care about anyone’s origin. As long as you possess powerful strength, you’ll gain my trust to handle important positions as well as having prominent status in the Tang Sect. I already declared that the first six people who advance to the Golden Core Stage will become the Guardian Elders of the Tang Sect. You’re Japanese, but I hold no prejudice against you. So, I’ll allow you to join the Tang Sect and become its true disciple from now henceforth. Further, you’re to be a Guardian Elder of the Tang Sect, so any disciple who sees you must salute you with respect. In addition, you also have the right to receive the allocated cultivation resources for Guardian Elders annually.”</p><p>An ecstatic look appeared on Kuwako’s face. She directly kneeled on one knee, placing her right fist on the left chest, and respectfully said, “Thank you, Bos… Sect Master. It was you who gave me my life and you’re also the person who taught me cultivation, which is the reason I’m so powerful now. You’ve been helping me in becoming a great personage in Japan as well. I, Kuwako, vow that my life is yours from now on. I’m willing to sacrifice everything for you.”</p><p>Tang Xiu squinted his eyes and he could sense the sincerity from her eyes. After gently nodding in response, he propped her up and said, “Do keep in mind what I just told you today. I expect the day when you break through to the Spirit Formation Stage in the future. You’ll follow me to leave Earth and step on the vaster stage. I will also remove the seal I cast on you before. Further, if you can advance to the Nascent Soul Stage quicker, I’ll treat you as my right hand later and entrust you the seat of an important position.”</p><p>Kuwako’s countenance slightly changed and she hurriedly asked, “Bos… Sect Master, you just said you’re going to take me to leave Earth? Where to, exactly?”</p><p>A meaningful look filled Tang Xiu’s eyes as he responded, “Earth is just a speck of dust in the universe in my eyes, and so is this plane. Kuwako, that world is much bigger and far further than you can imagine. It’s located in the midst of the vast expanse of stars with countless worlds inhabited by myriad races as well as innumerable powerhouses. That place will be my battlefield in the future, so if you are resolute to follow me and want to see that broader world, you must fight alongside me and blaze your way out to be a great figure in that universe.”</p><p>“You mean… there are, like, other places and countless human beings in this universe besides Earth’s?” Kuwako Yamamoto asked in confirmation, amazed.</p><p>“If anything, mankind is only a tiny part of them.” Tang Xiu sported a smile and said, “You can expect to find myriads of races and countless powerhouses there. Anyways, let’s drop it off first. You won’t be able to imagine what I just told you. Just strive to advance to the Spirit Formation Stage. Only then will you qualify to leave with me to be a hegemon there. Only then will you have the chance to fight against the world and become an existence that countless powerhouses of myriads of races will look up to.”</p><p>A brilliant light shone in Kuwako’s eyes. Her heartbeat turned a few times faster and louder upon hearing it. As an ambitious woman, the vision portrayed by Tang Xiu aroused her fighting spirit.</p><p><em>‘Don’t tell me Sect Master originally comes from that place?’</em> Such a thought suddenly popped up in Kuwako’s mind.</p><p>Tang Xiu then handed her an interspatial ring with a smile. “Drip a drop of your blood on it, and then use your spiritual sense to check it. There are cultivation resources inside as your reward. You can look at them slowly and take them back. Don’t go back to Japan for now, head to the Tang Sect’s holy land with me to cultivate there for a while instead.”</p><p>“Understood!” replied Kuwako Yamamoto respectfully.</p><p>“Is there something urgent you need to deal with in Japan soon, though?” asked Tang Xiu.</p><p>Kuwako looked hesitated and then answered, “Well, I’ve been preparing to take a big a chance recently. If this plan were to work out, I’d become the Patriarch of House Yamamoto, as well as the Schoolmaster of Northstar One Blade School. All of which will make my status there greatly elevated. Also, the business I’ve personally been managing has invested in a lot of investments which will yield much bigger profits in the future once they succeed.”</p><p>Tang Xiu squinted his eyes and shot a deep look at her. Then, he smiled and said, “If so, then I’ll allow you to pick ten children after you have arrived at our Tang Sect’s holy land. They will become your right-hand people in the future. After you’re done with your cultivation on Nine Dragons Island later, you can take them back with you to Japan to handle some issues for you.”</p><p>“Uh? Children?” muttered Kuwako with a confused face.</p><p>“Well, don’t ask more about that first.” Tang Xiu smiled and said, “You’ll know about it after you come to our sect’s Nine Dragons Island. Go now. We’ll be staying here for two days and will leave after.”</p><p>“Acknowledged!” Kuwako left the room and closed the door from the outside.</p><p>Tang Xiu shifted his sight back to the window and pondered over some issues in silence. He had exposed the existence of the Tang Sect because of the incident with the demonic beasts, as well as the fact that he had a lot of experts under him. Although the Tang Sect’s power could deter some people, it would undoubtedly make some others guard against and be wary of him.</p><p>It also made him analyze the current situation related to Duanmu Lin and the Special Abilities Bureau. Now that this agency had lost many ability users, Duanmu Lin had begun to recruit some cultivators with no affiliation in the country to fill in the vacancy in the agency. If the country, which was represented by Duanmu Lin, started to be wary of him, it’d be likely that it would become quite troublesome in the future.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
