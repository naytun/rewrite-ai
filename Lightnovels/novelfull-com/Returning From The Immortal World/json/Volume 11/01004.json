Had it been a decade prior, he would’ve been able to stand upright when facing this man. However, he only had trivial energy in Bangkok, whereas this man was much richer, more powerful, and better than him; so he could only lower himself.</p><p>“You can just leave the reconstruction to me. It’s my place so I must be the one to handle it. I appreciate your intention, but I have to decline,” said Zuo Daquan.</p><p>“You misunderstood me.” Kanaja’s complexion changed and he seriously said. “Rebuilding your site is what Mr. Tang wants me to do, so it’s I who’ll find the construction team and provide the fund. You owe me some money, so I’m going to deduct it from your debt. I hope you know what to report to Mr. Tang about it later.”</p><p>Zuo Daquan immediately realized Kanaja’s intention. It was to express goodwill to Tang Xiu! If Tang Xiu was someone who always paid his grace back, he would take it as a favor. As he came up to this point, Zuo Daquan forced a smile inwardly. As people said, it’s easy to repay the money debt, but favor and grace were the most difficult to pay!</p><p>He had that chance to have Tang Xiu owed him a favor, yet he just wasted it away and could only have regret after he lost it. It was the most regrettable thing he had ever done in this world. If God was ever given him another chance to come again, he would’ve never missed it. If he could add such opportunity to what he already had, he’d have absolutely given his all to work under him, even if he must regard him as an ancestor.</p><p>Yet now, he could only that bits of regret bit his heart. Just as he was about to speak, his expression suddenly shifted as he saw Zuo Qing approaching with his two adorable grandsons and several trusted men who escorted them.</p><p>“Qing’er!” Zuo Daquan strode to welcome them.</p><p>At this time, Zuo Qing was so shocked and paralyzed. She never dreamed that the place she just left had turned into ruins.</p><p>Could it be that… father’s guess was correct that Tang Xiu is in cahoots with the Huang and came here to retaliate them?</p><p>“What is going on here, Dad?” asked Zuo Qing with a bit ugly expression.</p><p>“What else? It was because of Tang Xiu!” replied Zuo Daquan with a bitter smile.</p><p>It’s true!</p><p>The reply made Zuo Qing depressed somewhat. Then she said astringently, “I’m really sorry, Dad. But Divine Doctor Tang is famous in China and is a good man. I just can’t believe that he’s colluding with the Huang. Could it be just a mistake?”</p><p>The question made Zuo Daquan stunned. He could see the bitter expression on her face and immediately let out a dry smile. “It’s been a big misunderstanding indeed, Qing’er. But it was on my part who did that. Mr. Tang never colluded with the Huang. I even believed what you told me that he’s our family’s benefactor since he has helped us mediate the grudge with the Huang. What I just said it was caused by Mr. Tang was due to the battle between him and his enemies here. We just kind of got implicated by it.”</p><p>Zuo Qing’s eyes bulged out as she exclaimed, “What did you say, Dad? You mean… Divine Doctor Tang didn’t have the intention to ruin our place and it was caused by the battle with his enemy? He…H-he, how is he now? Is he injured?”</p><p>“Even if you care about him, you don’t need to ask so many questions at a time, Qing’er,” said Zuo Daquan with a dry smile. “Besides, I really dunno about all those.”</p><p>“Thanks for the worries, Miss Zuo. I’m fine.”</p><p>Tang Xiu floated down from the air while carrying Tang An and quickly appeared in front of everyone. As he released Tang An’s waist and held her arm, he let out a faint smile and said, “I apologize for ruining your site, Mr. Zuo. But you can rest assured that I’ll compensate you for it.”</p><p>“No, no, no. Please nevermind it, Mr. Tang,” said Zuo Daquan hurriedly. “You fought your enemies and you didn’t intend to destroy my site. I…”</p><p>As he said up to there, he suddenly remembered Kanaja and immediately turned his head to look at the man. His heart skipped a beat upon seeing his face turned a bit ugly. If he said that Tang Xiu didn’t need to compensate him, it was very likely that Kanaja would lash out at him. He could expect this man to take revenge on him after Tang Xiu left.</p><p>Certainly, Tang Xiu could tell there was something between the two men and smilingly said, “Well, I may have to trouble you this time, Mr. Kan. But you can consider it as I owe you a favor and you can expect to have my assistance in the future once.”</p><p>Upon hearing Tang Xiu’s statement, Kanaja was overjoyed inwardly and he smilingly said, “That’s very kind of you, Mr. Tang. To be at your service is an honor for me. You can rest assured that I’ll cremate all the dead bodies later. I’ll also find the construction team since you already asked me to rebuild this place. I can tell the construction team to work overtime to have it rebuilt quickly. You can leave all the issues here to me and feel relieved.”</p><p>“Then I’ll have to trouble you for it.” Tang Xiu nodded and said, “Just call me after you rebuild this place, I’ll reimburse you and transfer the money to your account directly.”</p><p>“Please don’t!” said Kanaja quickly. “You’re my guest here, how can I let you pay for it? Please consider the renovation’s cost as a token of my gift for you! Also, I’ve already arranged to invite you to my Exquisite Fallen Petal tomorrow night. Would you like to come?”</p><p>The Exquisite Fallen Petal Cruiser?</p><p>The name made Tang Xiu remember the cruiser on the Chao Phraya River which rumored as the Paradise on Earth. However, he still had many issues to deal with and there was no time at all for anything else, so he said, “You’ve seen the situation here today, Kanaja. Singkuo has escaped and another fish also slipped away. I’m afraid I don’t have yet the time to accept your invitation for now. It’s better to wait until we have Singkuo and all my enemies in Bangkok been dealt with. But I’ll prepare a gift for you when I visit you later and we’ll dine by then.”</p><p>Tang Xiu’s refusal didn’t make Kanaja unhappy at all and even felt more excited after hearing it. He repeatedly nodded and said, “I’ll be sure to prepare my place after Mr. Tang has tended to your business then.”</p><p>“Alright, you can tend to business first. My grand disciple has been seriously injured and I need to find a quiet place to treat her,” said Tang Xiu.</p><p>Zuo Daquan, who had been looking for any means to express goodwill to Tang Xiu immediately interjected upon hearing it, “Mr. Tang, I still have an underground storehouse even though my place is ruined. You can use it for the treatment if you’d like to.”</p><p>His offer instantly made his men looked shocked, confused and also worried.</p><p>“If so, then I’d like to trouble you to lead me the way!” Tang Xiu nodded.</p><p>Zuo Daquan replied and then ordered his men before leading Tang Xiu and the rest to walk toward the ruins. When they came to a certain collapsed building, dozens of strong men quickly cleaned up the surroundings, revealing the entrance to the underground space.</p><p>Screech!</p><p>The entrance door was sounded and a downward staircase slowly appeared in front of everyone.</p><p>While leading everyone down, Zuo Daquan explained, “I’ve been using this underground space to store gold actually. The interior is quite messy, but it’s very clean and I also have placed various furniture and appliances inside. I often came here whenever I need to think about something.”</p><p>An underground space to store gold?</p><p>Tang Xiu’s face shifted and he quickly used his perception to survey the surrounding. The large size of the warehouse surprised him, nearly a thousand square meters with massive gold bars neatly stored on the shelves inside. The interior also had decent ventilation installation as well as looking clean and well equipped with needed objects.</p><p>“Please come here, Mr. Tang.”</p><p>Zuo Daquan, who had been observing Tang Xiu’s facial expression until everyone came to the entrance only found that Tang Xiu just glanced at the gold and then ignored it, causing him his hope and expectation plummeted.</p><p>“This is a good place.” Tang Xiu nodded and said, “Recuperate well, An. We’re staying here for some time.</p><p>“Yes, Grand Master,” replied Tang An respectfully. She then strode into the room and closed the door from the inside. She was not used to be in the sight of others for a long time and could’ve left already if she wasn’t with Tang Xiu.</p><p>Tang Xiu then turned to look at Zuo Daquan and lightly said, “Would you mind telling me what are you storing so many golds here for, Mr. Zuo? Are you buying it at a low price to sell them at a much higher price?”</p><p>“Speaking frankly, I own a gold mine which I mine a lot of gold ores from annually, Mr. Tang. Some of it is exchanged for cash and the rest is stored. Though the plummeting gold price recently kind of causing me to stop selling my gold reserve,” said Zuo Daquan with a dry smile. “Due to that, I’m planning to use gold to pay off a lot of money I owe Mr. Kan which I haven’t been able to pay back for a while.”</p><p>Tang Xiu was surprised before nodding. “The gold price has been mediocre some time indeed. But for you to own private gold mine is kinda rare and unexpected!”</p><p>“I bought that gold mine with quite a price long ago. Although I’ve earned the investment back for quite some time, the gold ore reserve is also dwindling. I originally planned to exchange all of them when its price goes up, but as of recently, it seems impossible.”</p><p>“Care to tell me the current gold price?” asked Tang Xiu.</p><p>“It’s 290,” answered Tang Xiu.</p><p>Tang Xiu then turned to Kanaja and asked, “Do you mind if I want to buy gold from Zuo Dakuan, Kanaja? I know that he’s gonna use it to pay the debt to you with a lower price, but I can buy it for a higher price than the current market price.”</p><p>“I don’t mind about that.” Kanaja directly shook his head and said, “He doesn’t owe me that much anyway.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
