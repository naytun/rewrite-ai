He could see the thirteen Shaman Guardians returning, but injured, and not bringing Singluen back.</p><p>Could it be… An accident happened?</p><p>He dashed out of the window and appeared in front of them in the  blink of an eye, questioning, “Where’s Singli and Singluen? You are all  injured, though only minor wounds. What exactly happened?”</p><p>The 13 Shaman Guardian ceased their pace and knelt on one knee at the  same time in front of Singtuo. The middle-aged man reported with a  complicated and bitter face, “A mishap happened, Patriarch. We weren’t  able to save Singkuo, while Singli, who harbors malice and covets the  Patriarch seat, ran away.”</p><p>The report made Singtuo’s complexion enormously change and caused him  to shout angrily, “What rubbish are you talking about? Singli is a  high-rank clan elder! How come Singli wants to take over the patriarch  seat? You… No! What did you just say? I ordered you to rescue Singluen,  but why did you tell me you were unable to save Singkuo? What the hell  is going on?”</p><p>The 13 Shaman Guardian quickly narrated the whole event and finally  said, “Singkuo’s men were all killed, and I’m afraid that he is also  dead now. Singli has been harboring malice all this time; he even has  two Dark God Thunder. If it wasn’t for Young Master Singluen’s side that  forced him to the edge and endangered his life, he wouldn’t have taken  out the Dark God Thunder to save his life, making them known.”</p><p>Singtuo stared with an incredulous look. He simply couldn’t believe  the report, yet he had to since these were his most loyal warriors of  the clan. It would mark the end of the Dark Shaman Clan if even the  Shaman Guardians were no longer reliable.</p><p>Yet, why did this matter end up like this? Was Singkuo really killed by Singluen and those Chinese cultivators?</p><p>The 13 Shaman Guardians looked hesitant and spoke again bitterly,  “It’s best for us to seize the time to prepare, Patriarch. Young Master  Singluen, he…”</p><p>“What’s wrong with him?” asked Singtuo with a heavy voice, “It’s  still not enough for him to kill Singkuo, so he wants to kill his own  father?”</p><p>“He said that killing Singkuo will be the first task, and he’ll  immediately come to the clan after he kills him,” explained the captain.  “He wants you to step down from the patriarch seat and pass it to a  more qualified person. He… his ultimate goal is to be the Dark Shaman  Clan’s patriarch.”</p><p>“How dare he!” roared Singtuo.</p><p>“The other party is very powerful, Patriarch,” continued the captain.  “Ignoring those Chinese cultivators, Young Master Singluen, his five  guardian elders, and that girl have become much stronger now. We thought  that Young Master Singluen was not a match for Young Master Singkuo,  but they are now equals.”</p><p>“That’s nonsense!” yelled Singtuo angrily. “I know Singluen’s  cultivation level. I tested his strength some time ago! His power is  just weak. There’s no way he can catch up with Singkuo.”</p><p>“I stand by my report, Sir. Young Master Singluen is much more  powerful now,” replied the captain with a forced smile. “It wouldn’t be  easy for me to win against him in a one-on-one fight. Furthermore, the  previously mediocre five guardian elders at his side have also become  much more powerful now. I can tell that my chance to kill any of them is  less than 60%.”</p><p>The report was pretty much a shock for Singtuo. Sparks of disbelief clouded his eyes, and he remained silent for a long time.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>A figure flickered and instantly appeared in front of Singtuo and the  13 Shaman Guardians. A thoughtful look was on the old man’s face as he  slowly said, “It’s actually not impossible for Singluen and his guardian  elders to have their cultivation progress rapidly in such a short  period of time. There are indeed some means to make one’s strength  progress that rapidly.”</p><p>“What kind of means is it, Father?” asked Singtuo rapidly.</p><p>“Medicinal pills of China,” said the old man vaguely.</p><p>Singtuo himself was well aware that there were some powerful people  among Chinese cultivators who were masters at concocting medicinal  pills. But it was a thing from legend only. To the best of his  knowledge, pill refiners among Chinese cultivators were few and far  between, causing each pill to be a priceless treasure for these  cultivators.</p><p>If… if there was a pill refiner among the cultivators Singluen had  befriended, it was impossible that person would give so many of them to  Singluen and his men at once!</p><p>At the moment, the 13 Shaman Guardians were petrified and stared  silly at the old man in front of them. Their hearts were beating several  times faster.</p><p>‘The previous Patriarch? How can this be? Didn’t the old patriarch  die more than a decade ago? How come he’s still alive and now appears  here?’</p><p>The old man looked at the 13 Shaman Guardians and let out a pale  smile. “I know you’re all confused and asking why I, who have died, have  turned out to be still alive and now appear before you. Might as well  tell you about it now that I’m here. I faked my death since I’ve been in  closed-door cultivation in the clan. I decided I wouldn’t show up  unless our clan faced an imminent life-and-death crisis.”</p><p>The 13 Shaman Guardians instantly understood and respectfully  kowtowed to the old man and greeted, “Paying respect to previous  Patriarch!”</p><p>The old man happily nodded and waved his sleeve. A stream of energy  flowed out from it and raised up the 13 Shaman Guardians as he said,  “You’ve carried out your job well. It was I who trained you in the past;  all of you have become much stronger now. You also have contributed a  lot to the clan while assisting Tuo. After we pass through this crisis,  I’ll open the Dark Altar to help improve your cultivation further.”</p><p>Ecstasy covered the 13 Shaman Guardians’ faces. The last time they  used the Dark Altar to enhance their cultivation was more than a decade  ago. If they could use the Dark Altar’s power to raise their power again  to a higher level, it was very likely that their strength would compare  to the current Patriarch.</p><p>“We offer our gratitude to the old patriarch.”</p><p>Singtuo looked at the old man and said, “What do you suggest in  resolving this incident, Father? Is it really necessary to give Singluen  the patriarchal seat?”</p><p>“If you pass him the patriarch seat, the position of our Dark Shaman  Clan’s patriarch is his. But if he seized it with force, then he commits  a capital crime for rebellion,” said the old man faintly.</p><p>Singtuo slowly nodded and said, “I understand what you mean, Father.  You can rest assured about it. I’ll prepare everything right away. If  Singluen keeps working hard, I’ll pass the patriarch seat to him in the  future. But if he dares to rebel and seize it by force, I’ll get rid of  this scourge of a son by my own hands.”</p><p>Shortly after, a lot of Dark Shaman clansmen received orders from the  patriarch to return to the clan at once. The decree made all of the  clansmen of the Dark Shaman Clan around the world stop their activities  to rush to the clan’s land in Bangkok.</p><p>****</p><p>Near the ruins of the coconut plantation.</p><p>“Huh?’ Singluen’s face suddenly changed after receiving the news.</p><p>Tang Xiu, who was next to him, saw his face and immediately asked, “What’s the matter?”</p><p>“It must be because of the report by those 13 Shaman Guardians. Hmph,  they must have told my father that I want to seize the clan’s patriarch  seat by force.” Singluen coldly snorted and said, “My father just  issued a decree that all the clansmen outside the clan must return at  once. Oddly enough, my men and I didn’t receive it.”</p><p>“Ah, it seems your old man has begun to take precautions against you,  Singluen,” sighed Tang Xiu. “We’re probably going to face your whole  clan if we don’t speed up our pace.”</p><p>“Let’s rush to my Dark Shaman Clan’s land now, Mr. Tang,” said  Singluen. “It’s obvious that my father doesn’t want to pass the  patriarch seat to me. The only option left is to use force.”</p><p>“That being the case, we’re going then!” Tang Xiu nodded. “Jin Shi,  you’re staying here to protect Tang An. Make sure she’s safe.”</p><p>“I won’t let anyone disturb her unless I die, Boss,” replied Jin Shi respectfully.</p><p>“No need for that!”</p><p>A hazy shadow suddenly flickered from the distance and appeared in  front of the group instantly. Tang An was still in her usual black suit,  bronze mask, and black gloves. After she turned to Tang Xiu, she  respectfully said, “I’ve recovered more than seventy percent, Grand  Master. I believe my injuries will be much better by the time we arrive  at the Dark Shaman Clan’s land if I keep recuperating on the trip.”</p><p>“Are you really okay now?” confirmed Tang Xiu.</p><p>“I’m fine, Grand Master. It won’t affect me much, even if I have to  fight again,” ensured Tang An. “I’m best at sneak attacks while you  fight at the front.”</p><p>“Let’s set off now, then!” Tang Xiu nodded.</p><p>Quickly, more than a dozen cars rushed toward the Dark Shaman Clan’s  ancestral land. Tang Xiu borrowed these cars from Kanaja and Zuo Daquan  to seize time and facilitate movement.</p><p>After half an hour, the cars had passed downtown Bangkok and  continued traversing the wide roads. A shadow flickered and moved  lightning-fast from the distance toward the car. After the car’s door  opened and shut again, Tang Guang was already sitting next to Tang Xiu.</p><p>“How was it? Did you get them?”</p><p>Tang Xiu turned his head to look at him and lightly asked.</p><p>“Got no traces on them yet, Boss.” Tang Guang forced a smile and  added, “Singkuo has got quite the good means of hiding, while that fella  who fled with him is quite capable as well. I found their traces a  couple of times and pursued them, yet still lost their tracks.”</p><p>“We’ve got quite a number of enemies we have recently provoked, don’t  we? It seems like we need to take some measures once we get back to the  mainland, huh?” sneered Tang Xiu. “Guang, there’s something I need you  to carry out once Singluen becomes the Dark Shaman Clan’s patriarch.”</p><p>“Please instruct me, Grand Master,” said Tang Guang respectfully.</p><p>“I’ve been planning to send you to Japan. You’re to help Kuwako to  take over the House of Yamamoto completely,” explained Tang Xiu. “Also,  help her train a group of experts. They will be pivotal for future  battles with our enemies. Having some Japanese fighters to charge and  shatter our enemies would be a good option.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
