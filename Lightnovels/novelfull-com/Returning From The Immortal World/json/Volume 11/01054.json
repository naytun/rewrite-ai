It wasn’t that extravagant, but the dishes were delicious, and the Magnificent Tang Corporation provided God’s Nectar, so everyone could dine and drink to their hearts’ content. However, Tang Guosheng’s mood was extremely heavy. Although he could see his old brother again, knowing his condition rendered his mood particularly unconformable.</p><p>Just as the birthday feast was about to come to an end, however, Tang Xiu received a sudden call that made his complexion drastically change.</p><p>Tang Xiu quickly came to Tang Guosheng and whispered, “I need to speak to you, Grandpa,”</p><p>Upon seeing his solemn expression, Tang Guosheng suddenly frowned and asked, “What is it?”</p><p>“There’s an urgent situation and I must leave the capital at once,” answered Tang Xiu.</p><p>“Another incident? What is it?” asked Tang Guosheng.</p><p>“Terrifying fierce beasts appeared in the Himalayas,” whispered Tang Xiu. “The location is very close to a small town called Ugley, and tens of thousands of its residents were attacked by them. Duanmu Lin told me on the phone that many residents have been killed and the town has become a ruin.”</p><p>Tang Guosheng abruptly got up. Rays flashed across his eyes a few times as he lowered his voice and said, “Then hurry there at once and kill those beasts ASAP. Remember, ensure your safety. Your life is your first priority!”</p><p>Tang Xiu said with solemnity, “I will.”</p><p>Tang Guosheng suddenly grabbed Tang Xiu’s hand and hurriedly said, “Protect Zicheng, Xiu’er. He has risked his life and braved dangers with me in the past, saving my life countless times. I’d have died many times already if it wasn’t for him. No matter how big the price is, I must guarantee his safety. Just let him… die peacefully in his bed of old age.”</p><p>Tang Xiu nodded and said, “I will.”</p><p>Shortly after, Tang Xiu contacted the Tang Sect’s disciples who were sent out. The Tang Family needed real experts to guard them, so he sent more than ten disciples to guard the Tangs after he founded Tang Sect. It was one of the tasks he assigned to them.</p><p>“Stop that elderly and wait for me!”</p><p>After he hung up the phone, he hurriedly left in a rush with Tang 28’s group of five. When he arrived at the train station and saw Zuo Zicheng’s confused face, he forced a smile and said, “Grandpa Zuo, it wasn’t Granda who sent me here. But I received a notice that some fierce beasts have appeared in Ugley and killed a lot of people. It’s my duty to go over there and eliminate them. It just so happens that you have to go back, elderly. So, we’re going there together and take care of each other along the way.”</p><p>A bitter look appeared on Zuo Zicheng’s face as he sighed. “Those fierce beasts are still rampaging, it seems. I already told everyone to move out quickly. I’ve even reminded the local authorities. It’s just so unfortunate nobody listened to this old man’s words. None of them believed me!”</p><p>“You knew of the existence of these fierce beasts?” asked Tang Xiu hurriedly with a changed expression. “Did those beasts cause you these injuries?”</p><p>“It’s far more than one beast. It’s simply… a nest of ominous beasts! Only that particular one is very powerful. I’d have already died if that one hit me. What injured me was a weaker one, though I was very fortunate to flee fast enough, so I survived.”</p><p>“Grandpa Zuo, please tell me the situation there,” said Tang Xiu hurriedly.</p><p>“Ugley is located near the Himalayas.” Zuo Zicheng nodded and said, “I’ve entered the Himalayas numerous times to get the Snow Lotus for many years. The last time I went there, I traversed deeper and found the nest of this ominous beast. The most savage and biggest beast was only as tall as two small buildings. It’s a big monster, nonetheless. But there are countless of them. Though they are not as big, they are still fearsome. I was just on the periphery of their nest before one of them spotted and injured me.”</p><p>“I see.” Tang Xiu nodded and asked again, “Since there are so many beasts there, have they come out before? How come they came out of their nest now?”</p><p>“I have no idea about the specific cause.” Zuo Zicheng sighed. “But what I can be sure of is that the beasts seem to have been blocked by something and were unable to get out. Even the one who chased me before was blocked by a layer of invisible energy or something. However, those beasts kept hitting something like an obstruction I couldn’t see. I think that’s why they are now rushing outside.”</p><p>An array formation?</p><p>Tang Xiu was shocked inwardly. Then, he said quickly, “Grandpa Zuo, this is an urgent situation, so we can’t take the train there. I’ve already contacted an airline, so we’ll go there by plane and then change into cars. Some people will aid us along the way.”</p><p>Obviously, Zuo Zicheng also wanted to know the current situation in Ugley, so he nodded and said, “We’ll do as you said.”</p><p>After a full day passed by, Tang Xiu and the rest who rushed to catch up even asked the aid from the local garrison’s military helicopter. They finally arrived at noon the next day to the town near the snow-capped peak of Himalayas… Ugley Town.</p><p>“Heavens! How did it turn like this?”</p><p>After seeing the current situation in Ugley, Zuo Zicheng’s old face was full of disbelief. The town of Ugley had literally been turned into a ruin. All the soldiers and civilians who survived the rampaging beasts had been moved outside while a garrison company had been stationed to defend it.</p><p>“Tang Xiu!”</p><p>Two figures flickered from the distance and quickly appeared in front of Tang Xiu. It was Zhu Long and Aquababe, whose faces were extremely solemn. Injuries were evident on their bodies with bloodstains that dyed their clothes red.</p><p>“How is the current situation here?” Tang Xiu hurriedly asked, “Did you fight with those beasts?”</p><p>“Miserable. It’s literally miserable,” said Zhu Long with a bitter face. “Just the current casualty statistic alone, thousands of people have been killed and thousands more have been injured. In addition, we’ve clashed with those beasts, but the situation is not optimistic. Four of our colleagues from the Special Abilities Bureau have died in battle and dozens of others are injured.”</p><p>“What about their numbers? How many beasts are there?” asked Tang Xiu.</p><p>“We have no clue. The number of beasts that have appeared is as high as a thousand,” answered Zhu Long. “There’s also a particularly horrifying one. Further, there was also the emergence of beasts from time to time, so it’s really difficult to count their number.”</p><p>Tang Xiu nodded and asked again, “What about Senior Duanmu?”</p><p>“He has already entered the Himalayas with a large group to set up a blockade line,” said Zhu Long. “Come with us! I’ll take you there.”</p><p>“Zhu Long, you settle Grandpa Zuo first,” said Tang Xiu. “He’s a local here, but he’s also a relative of my Tang Family who’s like a brother of my grandfather’s.”</p><p>After hearing Tang Xiu’s words, Zuo Zicheng felt extremely warm inside. But he waved and said, “Don’t worry about me. Just do what you should do. Besides, you must guard the safety of the people, but you must pay attention to your own safety.”</p><p>Tang Xiu hesitated for a moment and then nodded. “Then please pay attention to your own safety too, Grandpa Zuo.”</p><p>“Tang Xiu, let these five children stay here too!” Zhu Long interjected. “It’s not safe inside. We have no extra manpower to protect them if those fierce beasts appear again.”</p><p>“No. They don’t need protection. Let’s just set off.” Tang Xiu shook his head.</p><p>Hearing his response made Zhu Long look somewhat helpless. He really had no idea why Tang Xiu brought five children who were perhaps less than 10 years old.</p><p>After half an hour, the group had crossed a snowy peak and entered the depths of the mountain range. Soon after, a military tent appeared in Tang Xiu’s line of sight. Moreover, over a hundred ability users from the Special Abilities Bureau and a large number of soldiers in camouflage uniforms were stationed at the blockade line arranged near the military tent.</p><p>“You’re finally here, Tang Xiu.”</p><p>Duanmu Lin was not in the tent but was waiting outside for Tang Xiu.</p><p>“I just arrived here. So, what’s the current situation, Senior Duanmu?” asked Tang Xiu. “Are those savage beasts rushing into the blockade line?”</p><p>“I found something strange about them. They are like a fierce beast army as if there are intelligent beasts commanding them.” Duanmu Lin nodded and explained, “From the time we arrived here, there have been small-scale beast tides attacking us. Fortunately, some cultivators rushed to help us. Otherwise, we couldn’t have stopped them just by the strength of the Special Abilities Bureau and the military alone.”</p><p>“Low-rank and mid-rank fierce beasts only have low intelligence, but the high-rank ones have intelligence on par with humans,” said Tang Xiu. “On top of these high-rank beasts, there are still superior-rank beasts and monster beasts. Be it the superior-rank or the monster beasts, all of them possess high intelligence and have the ability to control armies of fierce beasts.”</p><p>“High-rank fierce beasts are already horrible by themselves! If this is a superior-rank or a monster beast, that will spell big trouble,” said Duanmu Lin in a surprise with contracted pupils.</p><p>“I think the possibility of superior-rank and monster beasts is rather slim,” added Tang Xiu. “The biggest ominous beast should be a high-rank one. However, this is just a guess of mine, so I need to see it myself to be clear. That’s right. You told me that some cultivators are helping. Who are they?”</p><p>“Some are from the Occult Sect and some others are Taoist and Buddhist cultivators, as well as some ancient martial art clans’ experts,” answered Duanmu Lin. “In actuality, our country has already signed some secret pacts with these people. We have the right to summon them for help whenever the country faces a major crisis.”</p><p>“I see.” Tang Xiu nodded and said, “Those who are righteous and have a spirit of justice will indeed care about their country. They will come forward in the event of a crisis.”</p><p>“Tang Xiu!”</p><p>Suddenly, a shout came from afar.</p><p>When Tang Xiu looked at the distance, he saw Miao Wentang, Shao Mingzhen, and Dao Master Ziyi rushing over lightning-fast. However, he found that all three of them had been injured, especially Dao Master Ziyi, whose injuries were quite serious.</p><p>“Take this medicinal pill!”</p><p>Tang Xiu took out three Holy Healing pills from his interspatial ring and handed them one each separately.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
