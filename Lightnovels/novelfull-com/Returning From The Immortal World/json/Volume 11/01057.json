Afterward, he ordered the Tang Sect’s disciples to board the Subaquatic Corvette. It only took them 10 minutes to arrive at a certain port in Jingmen Island. Dozens of buses had long been waiting to transport them to Shanghai Airport, where a plane had been prepared in advance to send everyone to the west.</p><p>However, in addition to most of Tang Sect’s experts, Tang Xiu’s disciples were also in the sortie. Gu Yin herself was a Golden Core Stage expert at present. Tang Xiu didn’t want her to be a greenhouse flower. So, she must experience battle and frequent life and death fights to succeed, as only then would she be able to be a force to be reckoned with in the future.</p><p>Ugley. The town was now in chaos and badly damaged. Olive-green tents had been set up, joined together to serve as temporary accommodation. As a large number of soldiers blocked all traffic routes from the surrounding regions, ordinary people were also prohibited from entering.</p><p>“Why are there so many reporters here?”</p><p>When Tang Xiu had just arrived, a line of reporters with their cameras were flocking outside the blockade line, poking their heads to peek inside the town.</p><p>Honk, honk…</p><p>Some military off-road cars’ horns sounded, forcing all the reporters to make way. As the soldiers driving the SUVs showed their documents, the convoy then entered the interior quickly.</p><p>At this moment, Duanmu Lin and a few experts from the Special Abilities Bureau had long been waiting in front of the military tent. He suddenly looked surprised when he saw strong and sturdy men and women get off from the dozens of military off-road vehicles, especially due to the military bags they were carrying.</p><p>Tang Xiu went forward, greeted him, and said, “Senior Duanmu, I’ve brought over most of my sect’s members, a total of 201 people. I hope you can arrange a separate place for them to stay here, while I also ask the commanding power over them.”</p><p>Duanmu Lin was silent for a moment and then curiously asked, “There’s something I wanna ask you first, Tang Xiu. Are they soldiers or cultivators? They have both a dense soldier aura and killing intent.”</p><p>“Let me be frank, Senior Duanmu,” said Tang Xiu. “They are all cultivators trained by my disciple. Most of them have been sent to some very brutal environments overseas when they were young, and the majority of them are also wanted criminals in the world. But I can guarantee that they only killed those who deserved to be killed, and neither have they ever done anything illegal in our country.”</p><p>Duanmu Lin slowly nodded and said, “I’m relieved with your guarantee. Alright, I’ll immediately assign some men to arrange their accommodation. They will also receive their rations and material. Before that, however, I have one last question.”</p><p>“Please ask!” Tang Xiu nodded.</p><p>“It’s about their strength. Can they really hold the blockade line in the next mission?” asked Duanmu Lin.</p><p>“Their mission is not to arrange the blockade line but to enter the depths of the Himalayas to hunt those demonic beasts. This is also the main reason why I requested the commanding right over them. But you can rest assured that the weakest among them is at the Foundation Establishment Stage, so they have the ability to protect themselves should they encounter some terrifying fierce beasts.”</p><p>With a changed expression, Duanmu Lin nodded and said, “Alright then! I won’t say anything more since you’ve already decided. Also, Tang Xiu. There was another wave of demonic beasts just two hours ago. Dozens of people have fallen and dozens more are now injured.”</p><p>“How many were there in the last wave?” asked Tang Xiu.</p><p>“200 in total.” Duanmu Lin forced a smile and said, “But the most powerful one of them was unusually powerful. Fortunately, Miao Wentang, Shao Mingzhen, and Dao Master Ziyi joined hands to repel those Demonic Beasts.”</p><p>Tang Xiu’s expression slightly changed. For those three to join hands to repel the demonic beast, it meant that the demonic beast was at least comparable to an expert at the late-stage of the Foundation Establishment. A harassing attack with such a powerful demonic beast in command only meant that there were likely many of those demonic beasts possessing fearsome strength in the depths of the mountain.</p><p>After half an hour, temporary tents had been set up in a remote open space and separated from the others’ accommodations.</p><p>“Everyone, assemble!”</p><p>The moment Tang Xiu issued the order, the 201 disciples of the Tang Sect appeared in front of him and quickly arranged themselves in rows.</p><p>“Mo Awu, Jin Shi, Ye Shisan, and Hao Lei. You four will act as the captains with each leading 40 disciples.” Tang Xiu ordered with a deep voice. “You all will execute my command while the rest will follow me. We’ll be divided into five teams, and our main purpose is to hunt and kill demonic beasts to sharpen ourselves.”</p><p>“Acknowledged!”</p><p>The four people immediately reported back.</p><p>“Let’s set off! We’ll go probe the situation in the interior. You can also make use of the high-tech equipment you brought here in the battles that follow,” continued Tang Xiu. “Especially the monitoring equipment that you can use to detect the demonic beasts’ movement if used properly in time, which can aid us in executing the battle plan promptly.”</p><p>Late at night, Tang Xiu and Ye Shisan silently sneaked into the depths of the Himalayas like ghosts. When they crossed two peaks, they suddenly felt their shoulders pressed down by an invisible pressure.</p><p>“Something is wrong with the space gravity here, Sect Master,” said Ye Shisan with a suppressed voice and extraordinarily solemn face.</p><p>“True. I sense that the gravity here is at least five times higher than on the outside. It will no doubt affect us if we fight the demonic beasts here,” replied Tang Xiu. “Ye Shisan, you’re to retreat first while I sneak inside to probe the situation. Keep in mind that you’re not to engage in a long fight with any demonic beast. Kill it if you can, but immediately retreat if you cannot.”</p><p>“I’ll go with you, Sect Master. I can guard your back in case of danger,” replied Ye Shisan with a worried face.</p><p>“No.” Tang Xiu shook his head.</p><p>“Then I’ll be waiting for you outside,” said Ye Shishan helplessly. “But please retreat immediately if you’re in danger.”</p><p>Tang Xiu kept quiet. After watching him retreat from the place with anomalous gravity, he then released his spiritual sense. He took out an Invisible Charm, activated it and rushed forward. Along the way, he encountered more than a dozen waves of demonic beasts, some of which exuded a huge aura that Tang Xiu judged to be at the Golden Core Stage.</p><p>‘Where could the big one among them be?’</p><p>Sneaking into the mountain range’s depths at night served two purposes. The first was to install a monitoring device to find out the demonic beasts’ movements in real-time, and the second one was to find the two most powerful demonic beasts so as to figure out their real strength.</p><p>‘Bad!’</p><p>Tang Xiu’s body suddenly tightened and he instantly retreated backward. In nearly a blink of an eye, he retreated hundreds of meters away and hid into a snow pit.</p><p>Hou… Hou…</p><p>Two lion-like demonic beasts exuding enormous auras appeared in the vicinity with confused looks in their eyes. After staying for a while and looking around, they exchanged glances and shook their heads. They just felt a fluctuation of a special aura a moment ago with their keen perceptions, but that special aura fluctuation instantly disappeared the moment after. Not even shadows could be seen in the surroundings.</p><p>Shortly after, they looked around again but to no avail. After being unable to find any particular sign, they gradually moved towards the distance and soon disappeared from this area.</p><p>Tang Xiu restrained any leak of his presence in the snow pit. Those two lion-like demonic beasts gave him an intense feeling of threat. He could determine from their auras that each of them was comparable to the late-stage of the Golden Core Stage. With them joining forces, it was very likely that their combat efficiency would be at least at the Nascent Soul Stage and he might fall under their power.</p><p>They are highly intelligent and very alert, huh? Tang Xiu squinted his eyes.</p><p>20 minutes passed in the blink of an eye, yet Tang Xiu didn’t move at all and still maintained his original posture while controlling his presence and aura, waiting quietly.</p><p>ROAR…</p><p>For shadows then moved lightning-fast from the distance. Two of which were the lion-like demonic beasts that came here 20 minutes ago. The last two were like chimeras and strange creatures told in legends with numerous sharp spikes on their backs.</p><p>‘Hedgehog Beasts?’</p><p>With his spiritual sense covering the area, Tang Xiu could see the appearance of the last two demonic beasts. His heart sank because he knew what the Hedgehog Beast was. These beasts were like vassals of demonic beasts, yet highly intelligent compared to the likes of sly foxes. They were like advisors who provided advice and suggestions to the demonic beasts.</p><p>Furthermore, this beast species also had an important talent—their ability to detect unusual smells. As long as there was any lifeform aside from demonic beasts, they could detect their smell and determine the enemy’s position.</p><p>‘Seal of Heaven and Earth!’</p><p>Tang Xiu quickly cast two array disks and silently drew an array pattern. Immediately after, he used the two array disks to lay out a small array around him.</p><p>Half an hour passed and, after the four demonic beasts searched around and found nothing in particular, only then did they leave carefreely. After any traces of them disappeared, only then did Tang Xiu cautiously come out of the snow pit. He then silently retreated under the effect of the Invisibility Charm.</p><p>Chirp, chirp…</p><p>Just as Tang Xiu left the gravity space and felt the pressure lighten, he suddenly received a voice transmission into his mind. Quickly after, normal human language then appeared in his mind:</p><p>“Those were very powerful demonic beasts. Dealing with them will prove to be quite difficult if this restriction isn’t cracked down. Where are you now, Master? Fighting those demonic beasts will only result in your death with your current cultivation level.”</p><p>Tang Xiu’s face slightly shifted. After this thought transmission, he was pleasantly surprised and transmitted back. “You also sensed them, Star Devourer Insect?”</p><p>“Yeah. I sensed them and they seemed to have detected me as well,” replied the Star Devourer Insect. “Let’s… get out of this place, Master.”</p><p>“No hurry, no hurry. Can you sense what’s happening here? How can there be demonic beasts on Earth?” asked Tang Xiu.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
