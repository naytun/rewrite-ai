They are Jingmen Island’s locals, Guo Fugui’s men. They only scattered under my threats and are waiting around, hoping to seize a chance to take Yang Yan and her younger brother, Yang Fei.”</p><p>Tang Xiu glanced at the dimly lit area dozens of meters away from them, asking with a curious face, “Who is this Guo Fugui fella?”</p><p>“He’s a quite capable man in Jingmen Island and has a lot of shady business here,” answered Ouyang Yun. “Though my Ouyang Family never put him in our eye.”</p><p>“Then just ignore him since he’s only small fry,” said Tang Xiu smilingly. “Anyway, I’ll send someone to warn this Guo Fugui later. Sis Yun, I just came back from abroad and still have many things to do. I’ll take Yang Yan away, but I’ll be sure to thank you later should the opportunity come.”</p><p>“Nah, no need to thank me. Just treat my little sis well, I’ll already be satisfied if you do that,” replied Ouyang Yun smilingly.</p><p>“Lulu is my woman, so of course I must treat her well. You can rest assured about that, Sis Yun,” said Tang Xiu with a smile.</p><p>Ouyang Yun nodded with a smile in response.</p><p>Tang Xiu strode towards Yang Yan and then inquired. “Are you Yang Yan, Zuo Qing’s best friend?”</p><p>Yang Yan’s pupil instantly shrunk and she retreated a step. With a vigilant face, she asked, “Who are you? How do you know Zuo Qing?”</p><p>“You don’t need to be afraid of me. I and Zuo Qing… can be called friends! She bade me to tell you that she has arrived safely with her two children in Thailand. They are now safe under her father’s protection. But she believed that you, who helped her flee China, must have provoked the Huang. Even though Huang has written off the enmity they had with the Zuo, Zuo Qing was sure that you’d be in trouble, so she asked me to come over and help you out. She also asked me to ask you whether you’re willing to leave for Thailand.”</p><p>“Are you really Zuo Qing’s friend?” asked Yang Yan in astonishment.</p><p>“I don’t think there’s a need for me to lie, right?” Tang Xiu nodded.</p><p>“Your name is Yang Yan, right? I think you should know about my Ouyang Family, right? Tang Xiu is the son-in-law of my family. He’s my little cousin, Ouyang Lulu’s man, and what he said is the truth. You don’t have anything that forces him to deceive you.”</p><p>Ouyang Lulu? The infamous devilish woman of Jingmen Island? This handsome young man is actually her man?</p><p>A feverish expression suddenly appeared on Yang Fei’s face as he respectfully spoke, “I’m really happy to see you again, Mr. Tang. Big Sis, I can vouch that Mr. Tang is really the Ouyang’s Ms. Lulu’s boyfriend. I’ve seen him in the Paradise Club before and heard many of his legendary feats!”</p><p>Cough, cough…</p><p>Yang Fei’s vouch left Tang Xiu between laughs and tears as he looked at this young man. What the hell is this about me being a legend? How can there be any legendary stories about me? He shook his head and smilingly asked, “And you are?”</p><p>“Hello, Mr. Tang. My name is Yang Fei. I was a waiter in the Paradise Club prior to this. Yang Yan is my big sister, my blood sister,” answered Yang Fei.</p><p>“I see.” Tang Xiu finally understood and smilingly said, “Well, I have to advise your sister and you to leave Jingmen Island earlier, though. Although I’ll send some men to warn Guo Fugui, the lackeys are much troublesome to deal with than their Boss. I’m sure he’ll immediately send his men to pester you again whenever I don’t pay attention. That would be quite troublesome.”</p><p>Yang Fei hesitant before nodding. “Mr. Tang is right, Big Sis. We must indeed leave Jingmen Island. I know some facts about Guo Fugui. He’s a very ruthless man and is also infamous for taking revenge over the slightest offense. Leaving for Thailand is indeed the best and only choice we have.”</p><p>Yang Yan nodded repeatedly. She and her brother had gone through such a turbulent and winding journey. Now that they had a chance to guarantee their safety, she thanked Heaven for the sudden emergence of their savior, and she’d agree regardless of what Tang Xiu told them to do.</p><p>After saying goodbye to Ouyang Yun, Tang Xiu brought the siblings to his car. Then, he said in a deep voice, “Chi Nan, assign some men to escort them to Thailand, precisely Bangkok. I don’t want any mishap to happen on the journey. Also, you are to go and see Guo Fugui in person. Warn him to never pester Yang Yan again in the future.”</p><p>“What if he is adamant to make trouble for Miss Yang, Boss?” asked Chi Nan.</p><p>“If he refuses, then there’s no need for him to set his foot in Jingmen Island ever again,” said Tang Xiu indifferently. “Go and deal with it fast so you can go back earlier to the headquarters.”</p><p>Chi Nan nodded and suddenly asked again, “Boss, that’s the only car for you, so…”</p><p>“It’s fine. Don’t worry about it. Just go!” Tang Xiu ordered with a light smile.</p><p>After her departure, Tang Xiu walked back to Ouyang Yun and asked, “Sis Yun, can you lend me a car? I still got something important, so I want to deal with it quickly.”</p><p>“It’s just a minor matter. I’ll immediately tell someone to bring you one.” Ouyang Yun smilingly replied, “Anyway, I just called my cousin and told him that you are here. Whether you want to wait for him, he’ll be here soon.”</p><p>Her cousin? Tang Xiu asked again, “Who’s this cousin of yours? Is it Ouyang Lei?”</p><p>“Yeah, it’s him,” replied Ouyang Yun smilingly. “He was born four days earlier than me, so I call him cousin.”</p><p>Tang Xiu pondered for a moment and nodded. “Alright. I’ll wait for him for a while since he’s coming over! Also, this reminded me of something. Wasn’t this Paradise Club the one Lulu managed before? How is it still under the Ouyang’s management?”</p><p>“Ah, Lulu did sell this luxurious cruise ship, but the buyer was one of the Ouyang Family’s members,” answered Ouyang Yun with a smile. “You know, Lulu said that she’d be stuck with her man and be contented with him regardless of his lot no matter what happens. She has decided to be with you, so she kinda rushed to make sure to be out of touch with the family. You see, uncle has been kinda lamenting, wondering why his daughter ran away like that. She hasn’t gotten married yet, but she has begun to carry out her plan to manage the household of her future husband.”</p><p>Cough, cough…</p><p>Tang Xiu could only cough twice to cover up his awkwardness. But as he recalled everything Ouyang Lulu had done, he realized the truthfulness of what Ouyang Yun just said. Whenever he was with Lulu, the girl had always been calculating to figure out how many things and how much her Ouyang Family would need to prepare the dowry for her in the future!</p><p>Half an hour passed by. Tang Xiu was now sitting in the most luxurious hall of the Paradise Club while chatting with Ouyang Yun, waiting for Ouyang Lei to arrive.</p><p>Bang…</p><p>The hall’s door was thrust hard from the outside as the burly Ouyang Lei strode in a rush into the room. As he saw Tang Xiu, he immediately showed a pleasantly surprised face and opened his arms, shouting, “Wow, it’s really you, future bro-in-law! I thought the Intel Director pranked me when he told me you were here! Hahaha… it’s been six months since the last time we met, right? I never thought you’d be so much more handsome now!”</p><p>Tang Xiu couldn’t help but burst into laughter and gave him a big hug. After the hug, he smilingly said, “It’s so late and you haven’t slept yet, Brother Lei. Anyway, I heard that you’ve gradually taken over the Ouyang Family’s affairs recently. I believe you’re going to be the new Patriarch of the Ouyang Family soon, no?”</p><p>“Nah, that old man of mine’s still hale and vigorous. He’s even much stronger than me nowadays.” Ouyang Lei waved and smilingly said, “No way I’ll be the Ouyang Patriarch any time soon! Then, what about you yourself, huh? Your business is doing so well, and I can see your power and influence are getting bigger by the day. Whenever I called Lulu, she always said you’re always busy and doesn’t have much time to accompany her!”</p><p>“I don’t deny that. I always have some things that need to be dealt with.” Tang Xiu smilingly replied, “But you know her. She always oppresses me and makes me promise to accompany her for a while after some time. Anyways, what about you? Lulu told me that you just found your sweetheart? So, when will you get married? You can expect to get a lavish gift from me by then!”</p><p>“Hehe.” Ouyang Lei grinned and said, “Soon. Maybe by the end of this year. Anyway, why don’t you just give me the gift first?”</p><p>His response left Tang Xiu between laughs and tears. “Heh, what the hell are you asking the gift first for? You haven’t gotten married yet! But I do have some good things I wanna gift you, though.”</p><p>Having said that, Tang Xiu took a porcelain bottle from his interspatial ring and handed it over to Ouyang Lei. “There are ten drops of Body Tempering Liquid in it. Drop one into the bathtub and soak yourself in it. The process will be a bit painful, but it will be very beneficial to your physique. Keep in mind, the longer you soak yourself, the bigger the benefits you can get. Also, this is a manual for a tempering physique that should be suitable for your cultivation.”</p><p>Joy and surprise covered Ouyang Lei’s face, and he almost rushed to grab the porcelain bottle and manual. He looked like he would never put it down as he fiddled with them. He then nodded and said, “Well, my Lil’ sis can find such a husband like you is truly a blessing, bro-in-law. Anyway, I heard you’ve seen my Mom, though! Did she make you bleed?”</p><p>“Ugh…”</p><p>Tang Xiu’s heart couldn’t help but skip a beat. He recalled the meeting he had with his profiteer mother-in-law previously, and he did get fleeced by her literally. Looking at the excited Ouyang Lei, Tang Xiu rolled his eyes and grinningly said, “Well, are you interested in becoming a true expert, Brother Lei? Like those who can fly to the roof, vault over the walls, and use a leaf to injure their opponents?”</p><p>Ouyang Lei rolled his eyes, but he grinned and replied back, “I already can do all that. Don’t look down on me, dude. I can be regarded as an expert myself now. I just challenged a martial art expert at the grandmaster level recently and I only needed a dozen moves to beat him!”</p><p>Tang Xiu instantly understood that his profiteer mother-in-law must have taught Ouyang Lei the cultivation art manual he gave her. Tang Xiu himself was just a bit upset upon finding a bit shameful conduct from her, but he didn’t show it on the surface and spoke in a low voice, “Brother Lei, you’ve probably learned something else about me, haven’t you? But one must seize every opportunity he encounters to become stronger. So now, I’m giving you a chance. Do you want to be trained by my men? I can guarantee that you’ll be ten times stronger or even more after the training!”</p><p>“More than ten times stronger? Are you kidding me?” exclaimed Ouyang Lei. “No way I’ll refuse that. I’ll do everything you tell me to as long as I can become stronger!”</p><p>Tang Xiu clapped and smilingly said, “Well, you got the desire to be much better and stronger, huh? Then, put away everything you got at hand and hand them over to someone else. I’ll send you to the training place after that.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
