The net had been laid, preventing them from any chance of escaping. They wouldn’t be able to escape their doom even if they were twice as strong.</p><p>“Dragon Trap!”</p><p>“Lightning Grid!”</p><p>Two ability users of the Special Abilities Bureau flashed like shadows while unleashing their special abilities as they pursued the Fan Brothers. The soft soil beneath floated up and turned into two long clay dragons that instantly wrapped their legs, while electric sparks appeared out of the blue to form a big net to cover them.</p><p>Fan Jinzhong’s eyes turned around and fury burst out from them. As his arms fiercely waved forward, the bronze sword in his hand burst out into greyish rays and, in nearly in a flash, cut off the earthen dragons and the lightning grid. Taking advantage of this gap, the two brothers frantically ran away again.</p><p>Duanmu Lin’s complexion changed and he coldly said, “I didn’t expect them to have such a magical weapon. But they must die today no matter what.”</p><p>“No. The weapon in his hand is not a magic weapon, but a ghost one.” Tang Xiu shook his head and said, “This Fan clansman does have a bit of ability to be able to obtain such a rare ghost weapon.”</p><p>“Ghost weapon? What is that?” asked Duanmu Lin, confused.</p><p>“It’s a weapon refined by zombies and half-ghouls, nourished and refined by their death energy that ultimately formed after they tempered it,” explained Tang Xiu. “The cultivation of this Fan clansman, however, is not enough to refine such ghost weapon, so that rusty bronze sword in his hand must have been obtained from somewhere else.”</p><p>The old man floated over and interjected. “Tang Xiu is right. Although ghost weapons are rare, some places have them. For instance, in the black market. But this weapon is very evil and nobody but those cultivating in the ghost cultivation system can buy them.”</p><p>“Ah, there seem to be a lot of good things in the black market for it to even have ghost weapons?” replied Tang Xiu with amazement.</p><p>“The black market indeed has things that you can’t imagine, things you can hardly find anywhere else.” The old man let out a smile and said, “You can get them as long as you’re rich. But that Holy Healing medicine you refined will sell like crazy if you were to sell them in the black market. Some people will buy them even if the price is higher.”</p><p>“That makes sense.” Tang Xiu thought about it and nodded. “It seems that I must visit this black market in the near future.”</p><p>“If you do plan to visit it, then we can go together, Tang Xiu.” The old man’s face shifted and he smilingly said, “I’m planning to deal with these two half-ghouls and then leave for the black market afterward. Though it isn’t to sell these two half-ghouls, I still have some half-ghouls I need to sell there.”</p><p>After pondering for a moment, Tang Xiu shook his head and said, “We have each other’s contact number, Senior Zhong. I don’t think I’ll be able to go with you since I still have things to tend to in the near future. I’ll contact you when I’m free and we can go together if you’re available.”</p><p>“That’s fine with me!”</p><p>The old man nodded. Then, his body instantly flashed toward the Fan Brothers. His speed was very fast and a few silver spikes shot out from his fingers in a flash, piercing the Fan Brothers’ backs in just a few seconds.</p><p>“Demon-Lock Shackle!”</p><p>The blonde man’s figure moved like an arrow and appeared behind the Fan Brothers who had fallen to the ground in the blink of an eye. He wrapped the two brothers with a dark chain while four wind belts came the moment after and bound their limbs.</p><p>“BREAK!!!”</p><p>The two Fan Brothers roared. But right as the dark chain and four wind belts that bound them were about to break, the old man pulled out a steel ring and directly wrapped their necks.</p><p>“GET AWAY FROM US AND DIE!!!”</p><p>A gust of suffocating aura burst out from Fan Jinxing as he broke free from the chain and wind belts, rushing to the old man in an instant. He unleashed the rope with a golden hook from his waist and swept it at the latter’s forehead.</p><p>“You’re courting death!”</p><p>As the old man shouted and avoided the golden hook, a yellowish sword emerged from the scabbard on his back. Just as he was ready to launch a counterattack, the bound Fan Jinzhong suddenly flicked his finger and shot a black needle at him.</p><p>“You wanna trick me, huh?”</p><p>The old man was full of energy and used his sword to sweep away the black needle instantly. At this moment, however, Fan Jinxing flicked the rope and the golden hook moved lightning-fast and instantly tore open a bloody wound on the old man’s left arm.</p><p>Not far away from them, Tang Xiu slightly furrowed his brows as he faintly noticed that something not right was occurring with the Fan Jinzhong and Fan Jinxing. Although these two men were frantically fighting back in madness, their eyes were now filled with greyish qi while the horrifying aura of darkness being emitted by them gave a sign that something evil was going to burst out.</p><p>“I’m going to kill them.”</p><p>Tang Xiu’s toes flicked, lunging his body upward, and dashed toward the Fan Brothers like a cannonball. As he unleashed the divine sword, layers of sword lights swept forward in a flash.</p><p><em>Puff, puff, puff…</em></p><p>Fan Jinzhong and Fan Jinxing’s souls screamed as fearful looks appeared on their faces. Despite their desperate resistance, layers of swords kept inundating them and bloody wounds appeared on their bodies.</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>Tang Xiu flicked his wrist and the overlapping sword images instantly condensed into one. A violent aura burst out as the two men were slashed.</p><p>Duanmu Lin, who saw the whole scene, shuddered, for he never thought that Tang Xiu would actually be this powerful and just need one strike to kill the Fan Brothers. The aura and power Tang Xiu emitted out made him realize that the gap between him and the current Tang Xiu was huge.</p><p>It wasn’t only Duanmu Lin who was shocked at this time, even more than a dozen Elementalists from the Special Abilities Bureau gaped with slack jaws. The old man Zhong was especially surprised with disbelief in his eyes and face, staring Tang Xiu just like he was looking at a monster.</p><p>It was an insta-kill!</p><p>Tang Xiu just needed one blow to kill two very powerful half-ghouls. It was simply unthinkable. He was crystal clear that he was very powerful himself, yet it would take everything he had to kill these two half-ghouls.</p><p>‘He’s a cultivator! But what cultivation level has he reached now? Has he broken through to the Golden Core Stage?’</p><p>The old man was someone who revered power, and such a powerful expert was naturally someone who deserved respect, regardless of gender and age. Although Tang Xiu seemed to be in his early twenties, the strength he just displayed deserved his respect. As he took back the silver spike from the Fan Brothers’ backs, he looked at Tang Xiu and said, “You’re very strong, Mr. Tang.”</p><p>“It was they who were too weak, actually.” Tang Xiu calmly smiled and said, “Had they been stronger, it would not have been so easy to kill them.”</p><p>“Not really.” The old man shook his head and said, “They would only likely be on par with me had they been stronger. I don’t think I could last even a few moves if I faced you. Can you tell me whether your cultivation has reached the Golden Core Stage?”</p><p>‘The Golden Core Stage?’</p><p>Tang Xiu felt amused inwardly. Even if his current strength was to be compared to those experts at the early-stage of Nascent Soul, the gap wasn’t much. He could even slay those at the late-stage of Nascent Soul with the endless means he had at hand.</p><p>However, it was necessary to hide it so as to preserve some people’s faces! On the other hand, he didn’t want to expose his strength too much either, so he nodded and smilingly said, “Yeah, I’m indeed at the Golden Core Stage!”</p><p>The old man gave a thumbs up and praised. “I’m afraid us the bounty hunters will get a huge blow if you become a bounty hunter, Mr. Tang. You can even make us lose our jobs.”</p><p>“Please don’t worry about that, Senior.” Tang Xiu was at a loss whether he had to cry or laugh. “I have no interest in becoming a bounty hunter. I’m even more lazy to chase down those evil creatures who harm ordinary people. In actuality, my real identity is a businessman whose main job is to make money.”</p><p>“A businessman?” The old man sounded surprised and asked, “What is your business, Mr. Tang?”</p><p>Tang Xiu let out a faint smile and flicked his finger. A box of Gods Nectar then appeared in his hand. After sending it before the old man, he smiled lightly and said, “It’s our first meeting and we also just faced a common enemy, so we can be considered friends. Thus, I’d like to gift you this box of wine for this first meeting!”</p><p>“The Gods Nectar?” The old man’s eyes lit up and his throat suddenly squirmed.</p><p>“That’s right. It’s a wine produced by my company.” Tang Xiu smilingly said, “I hope Senior Zhong likes it.”</p><p>The old man raised his head suddenly and said incredulously, “Your company is <em>that</em> Magnificent Tang Corporation?”</p><p>“That’s right. I’m the owner of the Magnificent Tang Corporation.” Tang Xiu nodded.</p><p>The old man shot a deep look at Tang Xiu. He just got acquainted with Tang Xiu, but the longer he knew him, the more shocked he became. From knowing his identity as a cultivator at first to the medicinal pill he refined, to the killing of two half-ghouls just now, and now he found out that he was the Magnificent Tang Corp.’s owner. The old man suddenly realized that he, who had encountered and figure out countless people in his life, had been unexpectedly unable to see through Tang Xiu, and even got shocked by him the first time they met.</p><p>‘The new generation is truly replacing the old and is even much stronger!’</p><p>Sighing deeply in his heart, the only man then let out a serious expression for the first time and said, “Mr. Tang, this old man is called Zhong Zhicheng. I’m also a Chinese national who was fated with a chance to learn under a bounty hunter—my teacher. It’s really a blessing and fortune that I can get acquainted with you this time, Mr. Tang. I hope that we can cooperate more in the future.”</p><p>“You’re overpraising me, Senior Zhong.” Tang Xiu cupped his fist and smilingly said, “I’m sure that there will be many chances for us to cooperate later. However, since we’ve solved these two half-ghouls, then I’ll transfer 10 million dollars to your account!”</p><p>“You don’t need to pay it yourself, Tang Xiu.” Duanmu Lin stopped Tang Xiu and said, “Killing these two half-ghouls is the duty of Special Abilities Bureau and the responsibility of the country. Hey, geezer Zhong, you haven’t changed your previous account, right? Should I transfer the money to that account?”</p><p>The old man, Zhong Zhicheng, nodded and said, “Yeah. I haven’t changed it. It’s still the old one.”</p><p>Tang Xiu didn’t refute Duanmu Lin. He was naturally happy to see Duanmu Lin rush to pay the bill since his money didn’t come because the wind blew it to him.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
