One must have a big background if one wanted to get ahead in that world, or could only resign to his fate.</p><p>It was rather fortunate that Tang Xiu had nothing left to lose when he left that world. Although he couldn’t contact his followers and was unable to inform them that he was still alive, he still had his disciple, Gu Yan’er. She may be injured and her cultivation level had dropped to the point where she was like a new Immortal, but once she returned to the Immortal World, she would be able to restore her power at an extremely fast pace.</p><p>It must be noted that Gu Yan’er’s cultivation had reached the Perfected Golden Immortal Stage before she came to Earth and nearly reached Supremacy Stage, yet she was still a force to be reckoned with there. No Supreme in the Immortal World could underestimate her power.</p><p>“Yan’er, do you think you can refine the Nascent Shattering Pill now?” asked Tang Xiu after shifting his eyes to Gu Yan’er.</p><p>Gu Yan’er hesitated but still replied, “Not only that pill, but I think I can also refine Immortal Pills now, Master. It’s just that Earth is scarce on the main alchemy materials needed to concoct the Nascent Shattering Pill. I only know that this planet has Soul Collapsing Grass and nothing else, so it’s very difficult to refine Nascent Shattering Pills here.”</p><p>“You don’t need to worry about alchemy materials. I’ll solve this problem.” Tang Xiu said, “I’m also thinking about a set of rules since we’re going back there in the future. Those who are eligible to follow us must have enough strength. Hence, those who haven’t reached the Spirit Formation Stage are not eligible to leave with us.”</p><p>“Don’t you think the limit is a bit low, Master?” asked Gu Yan’er in hesitation. “We can find people at the Spirit Formation Stage literally everywhere in the Immortal World, yet they are but weak people there. In my opinion, it’s best to set the limit at the Great Ascension Stage. Any lower than that is not eligible to follow us.”</p><p>“Not really.” Tang Xiu shook his head and said, “You’re also well aware of the cultivation environment on Earth, Yan’er. The environment here is harsh and resources are also scarce. Advancing to the Great Ascension Stage is very difficult here. Even I myself dare not to say that I can advance and compete with experts at this cultivation realm. That’s why I think the limit at Spirit Formation Stage is already enough. We can find a blessed land when we return to the Immortal World. After gathering massive cultivation resources there, I believe we can stimulate their potential to the limits, which I reckon will make their cultivation advance enormously. I’m sure they can break through the Immortal Stage in 100 years.”</p><p>Gu Yan’er thought about it and approved Tang Xiu’s point. She then nodded and said, “You can rest assured, Master! I can refine a lot of Nascent Shattering Pills as long as there are enough ingredients. With that pill, I believe it won’t be long for us to have a large number of Nascent Soul Stage experts.”</p><p>****</p><p>At the countryside stud farm.</p><p>Dozens of burly men had gathered outside the western-styled villa and Guo Fugui, whose face was full of murderous intent, came out of the villa followed by two strong men. He glanced around at the group of his men indifferently and began speaking in a deep voice, “Men! You must have heard of a restaurant called Everlasting Feast Hall. This restaurant is now sheltering the murderer who has injured our brothers, so the owner of this restaurant must die! You’re going with me to force them to hand over the culprit and ask for justice or we’ll teach them a hard lesson!”</p><p>“Teach them a lesson!”</p><p>The tens of strong men raised their fists and roared aggressively.</p><p>Guo Fugui nodded happily and strode towards the row of cars nearby. After getting on the cars fast, the convoy headed to the Everlasting Feast Hall’s headquarters.</p><p>Sitting on the back seat, Guo Fugui’s eyes glittered. He had been to the Everlasting Feast Hall several times. The dishes there were really good and it was also a good place for recreation. But what he remembered the most was its celestial maiden-like Little Boss, Gu Xiaoxue.</p><p>He had seen a lot of beauties in his life, but only a handful of them could compare to such a peerless beauty like Gu Xiaoxue. There were only two stunning beauties in the entirety of Jingmen Island, one of whom was Gu Xiaoxue and the other was the princess of the Ouyang Family, Ouyang Lulu.</p><p>He didn’t dare to harbor any thoughts toward the latter since he was afraid that the Ouyangs would go all out to exterminate him. Gu Xiaoxue, however, was a different case as she seemed to have no background and had nothing to be feared of aside from the number of security guards in the Everlasting Feast Hall.</p><p>****</p><p>At the parking lot of the Everlasting Feast Hall.</p><p>Mo Awu was leaning on the car while clamping a cigarette. He looked to be deep in thought. He was well aware that the Everlasting Feast Hall had many secrets, the biggest of which should the Boss, Gu Yan’er. He didn’t know much about her even though she had literally raised him up and taught him some skills.</p><p>Be it her origins, age, or how powerful she was, he practically knew nothing about all that. Yet he knew that Boss Gu Yan’er was equal to his mother, his closest relatives, while Tang Xiu was a man he admired the most and served with absolute loyalty.</p><p>‘Guang, An, and Gu Xiaxue have all broken through to the Golden Core Stage. The three of them should be strongest experts in the entirety of the Everlasting Feast Hall. But my cultivation only reaches the late-stage of Foundation Establishment. I may be at the front of the list among all members here, yet it’s still far from what I want it to be.’</p><p>‘I know the two Bosses have an extremely fearsome origin since they are related to the existence of another plane. Let’s not say anything about Boss Gu Yan’er, just Boss Tang Xiu’s strength advancement is way too fast. If I can’t advance to the Golden Core Stage in a short time, I’ll become further and further away from him and may lose the opportunity to keep following him in the future.’</p><p>‘I must become stronger—much stronger. Tang Guang, Tang An, and Gu Xiaoxue are stronger than me since they started cultivating earlier. But I don’t think my talent and efforts are inferior to them.’</p><p>Mo Awu tightly gripped his fists and a resolute look filled his eyes.</p><p>Suddenly, his complexion shifted slightly as he looked at the flickering figure that moved lightning-fast towards him. Then he asked, “What’s the matter?”</p><p>“Some people have been following you and Boss, but they have yet to enter our manor and are just lingering in the vicinity.” Reported the figure.</p><p>Mo Awu furrowed his brows and said in a cold voice, “Let’s have a look at them. They should be experts since they can track us and come here while avoiding our detection.”</p><p>A few minutes later.</p><p>At the road junction outside the Everlasting Feast Hall was a plot of land full of lush trees and vegetation. Shielded by the darkness and hiding in the thick patch of bushes was the scar-faced man Liu Hao, who was like a cat that quietly observed the interior of the Everlasting Feast Hall with binoculars in hands. At this time, he had observed most parts of the site clearly.</p><p>By his side were three lean young men tightly grasping their machetes while vigilantly watching the surroundings. Any slightest movement or sound would be noticed by them immediately.</p><p>“Brother Mole, how long will it take for Boss to arrive here?” asked one of the youths in a low voice after he leaned toward Liu Hao.</p><p>“They should’ve just left and Boss must be bringing quite a lot of our brothers with him now,” replied Liu Hao grimly. “No matter how many security guards the Everlasting Feast Hall has, they will be nothing but flies who will beg for mercy by then. Those bastards, hmph. If it wasn’t for the sake of not alerting them, the four of us would’ve been broken in and captured those two already.”</p><p>“Hehe, we’re Boss’ men, Brother Mole.” The youth proudly grinned and said, “Who doesn’t know Boss Guo Fugui’s name in the whole Jingmen Island? Just relying on the security guards of the Everlasting feast Hall, yet they dare to fight us? I don’t think they can even fart if we break in to catch some people.”</p><p>Liu Hao just lightly smiled at his words. He was very content with his current life. As the top lieutenant of Boss Fugui, he was respected by a lot of people. He may have been nicknamed as Mole, but nobody really dared to trample this rat whatsoever. Over the years, he had been enjoying a good life and always got what he wanted; be it money or women, proving how comfy and easy his life was.</p><p>“Who is it?”</p><p>Suddenly, Liu Hao’s face drastically changed and a shocked look burst in his eyes. He was a capable fighter himself and had been practicing Sanda freestyle boxing for twenty-odd years. Normally, just seven-odd experienced gangsters were not enough to defeat him, yet he wasn’t able to notice some people approaching him in the dark.</p><p>In a flash, the other three youths raised their machetes and quickly gathered around Liu Hao, glaring at the light outside the shade of trees. Under the street lights five-plus meters away from them, Mo Awu, with hands crossed behind his back, was followed by four experts of the Everlasting Feast Hall. Their killing aura had locked the four men.</p><p>“You still ask as if you didn’t know, huh? You’ve tracked us here, yet you still ask who we are. What stupidity is that? So tell me, from which group of rascals and thieves are you? How dare you follow us and spy on our restaurant?” asked Mo Awu lightly.</p><p>Upon hearing the question, Liu Hao’s stiff body suddenly relaxed with a contemptuous look gleaming in his eyes. He stood up and walked out of the dark shades of the trees and sneered. “Heh, you’re really the people of the Everlasting Feast Hall, including that Kiddo? Why didn’t he come with you?”</p><p>“Man, things won’t end up peacefully judging from your words, will it?” Mo Awu shook his head and vaguely said, “Just tell me, who are you and why are you following us?”</p><p>Liu Hao rolled his eyes and observed Mo Awu and the four core members of the Everlasting Feast Hall instead. He then shook his head and said, “Looking at your burly physiques and all, you’re all look but no bite. I believe you’ll know about it soon, but only bad luck will await you by then.”</p><p>Mo Awu slightly furrowed his brows and ordered in a deep voice. “Capture them! We’ll interrogate them later.”</p><p><em>Whoosh! Whoosh!</em></p><p>Two stalwart middle-aged men appeared in front of the four men in a flash. Their movements were very precise and neat as they used palm strikes to hit the four men’s neck and directly stunned them.</p><p>At this sight, Mo Awu rolled his eyes and couldn’t help chuckling. “Heh, I thought you were all great experts or something! To think that you’re all just shrimps. You got knocked out with one blow, truly disappointing. Drag them in, guys! They must have a purpose for daring to track me and Boss here.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
