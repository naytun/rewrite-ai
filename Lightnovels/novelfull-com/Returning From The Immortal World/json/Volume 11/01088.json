Money was nothing but a very trivial thing to him, yet he needed a lot of cultivation resources, and the most direct means to get them was buying them with money.</p><p>The Magnificent Tang Corp. was about to open a new pattern of capital circulation, but Tang Xiu was having a headache due to their newly developed product… the Flying Disc. Great efforts and hardships had been poured into its research and, in turn, it must be used to raise capital. However, he wasn’t sure if the military could fully absorb and digest its production.</p><p>He fell into this train of thought for a long while. Then, he looked at Yuan Chuling’s group. They were his classmates and brothers, and thus, he sincerely hoped that they would be successful in life as well. However, he wasn’t prepared to teach them any cultivation art since the path of cultivation was full of thorns and riddled with dangers. He might as well let them live comfortably for a lifetime instead of pushing them into desperation to walk on the cultivation path.</p><p>Shortly after, he made another call and then spoke after his call got picked up, “I’m waiting for you at the Everlasting Feast Hall in Jingmen Island at 6 PM tomorrow. It’s about the big deal we’ve talked about previously. I’m ready to trade it with you.”</p><p>“Which field is it about?” Duanmu Lin’s voice came out of the mobile phone.</p><p>“It’s about that air vehicle,” answered Tang Xiu.</p><p>“I see. Then I’ll rush over to the Everlasting Feast Hall in Jingmen Island. I’ll be there at 6 PM tomorrow,” replied Duanmu Lin in a deep voice.</p><p>Tang Xiu hung up and then looked at everyone else. “Don’t rush back to Shanghai first, guys. I’ll be taking you all with me to see what a so-called big business means tomorrow evening.”</p><p>Yuan Chuling, Yue Kai, and Hu Qingsong exchanged glances and held some anticipation inwardly. They were all aware of how big the business Tang Xiu had been running was. The Magnificent Tang Corp. could literally be said as a money-printing machine that could be compared to the bank’s money-printing machine if fully operational.</p><p>Prior to this, Tang Xiu had never taken them to see any business negotiations. But he now seemed about to give them a chance to get enlightened since they had nothing important to do and were just fooling around at the present. They couldn’t help but look forward to it.</p><p>It was like an adage that said: people will be influenced by those close to them.</p><p>They used to have no ambitions nor lofty aspirations. They did have some dreams to achieve big accomplishments in life in the future once in a while, but at the end of the day, fantasy was nothing but fantasy—a daydream that would be gone in a flash and existed only to mock themselves. But ever since they got acquainted with Tang Xiu, they could see his unparalleled edge. They themselves didn’t seem to realize that they had subtly been influenced by Tang Xiu, thus leading to having expectations for the future and working hard to sow the seed for the dreams in their hearts.</p><p>Shortly after, Tang Xiu led Yuan Chuling’s group to the Everlasting Feast Hall’s HQ in Jingmen Island. He just assigned some people to settle them down and then left with Cheng Yannan directly.</p><p>In the spacious and bright room, Tang Xiu lit up a cigarette, paced toward the window and looked at the lush scenery of greenery outside. He watched many guests walking around and enjoying their leisure time.</p><p>“Have you thought about what are you gonna do in the future, Cheng Yannan?” asked Tang Xiu slowly as he turned to look at Cheng Yannan and puffed out smoke.</p><p>Standing behind Tang Xiu, Cheng Yannan wore a somewhat complicated look. Back when she met Tang Xiu, it was because he was expelled from other classes and got transferred to their class. At first, she didn’t like him and even hated him. She thought that Tang Xiu was a rotten rat that would affect all her classmates.</p><p>However, the current Tang Xiu had enough achievements to make her look up to him. She even felt that she had been really blind then after she learned a few things about him later on. It was because she felt that there was no other wonderboy in the world that seemed to be better than him.</p><p>What about what she wanted to do in the future?</p><p>It was an issue she had never mulled over. She had even thought about committing suicide in the past. It was Tang Xiu who gave her hope and opportunity, relieving her from much of her worries in life that made her pass her days comfortably. Only after Tang Xiu’s inquiry did she finally begin to consider what kind of future life she would like to have.</p><p>“I just… don’t know.”</p><p>Even after being silent for a long while, Cheng Yannan only let out a wry smile and shook her head. She knew that helping Tang Xiu to manage the herbs plantation and the fierce beasts ranch on the two islands in the South China Sea was but a temporary job. But she herself was at a loss and in the dark about what she wanted to do in the future.</p><p>“Since you yourself are in the dark, then might as well let me arrange the future for you. How about it?” said Tang Xiu slowly.</p><p>Cheng Yannan stared blankly and asked with a confused expression, “How would you arrange it for me, though?”</p><p>“You probably have guessed some things about I’m gonna do. You also have seen those who work for me,” said Tang Xiu. “If anything, if it weren’t for you becoming an ability user, I’d have made you marry your man and have several children to pass the remaining days of your life and let you live a peaceful life. But now, you’re no longer an ordinary person, so I think that you should have a more exciting life. Certainly, the dangers you may face will be very big, so it’s still your call.”</p><p>Cheng Yannan thought for a while and then asked, “I wanna know the life goals of my older sister first. Didn’t you arrange it for her too?”</p><p>“I see.” Tang Xiu nodded and said, “Your older sister is a strong and very capable woman. She knows some things about me as well. Hence, she can no longer simply belong to the country anymore. I once asked her if she wanted to be stronger and have a wonderful life. Her answer made me pleased: She wants to have such a life.”</p><p>“Since my older sister is willing to let you arrange her future life, then I’ll take it too,” said Cheng Yannan straightforwardly. “She’s the closest person to me, and I don’t want her to fight alone since she has taken such an unusual path. I want to be with her.”</p><p>Tang Xiu turned around and gave a thumbs up, praising. “You deserve to be Cheng Xuemei’s sister and my old classmate. I knew you’re not afraid of death and would make this choice. I’ll inform the supervisor of the two islands in the South China Sea that you’ll be transferred temporarily. After I’m done with the business negotiation tomorrow, you will go with me to Nine Dragons Island! I’ll give you three months of training there. If you can complete the first stage of training in this period of time, I’ll let you return to the islands.”</p><p>“Where is this Nine Dragons Island, though?” asked Cheng Yannan curiously.</p><p>“You’re not considered as a Tang Sect disciple as of now, so you’re not eligible to know the location of the Tang Sect. Wait until you get there. If you can successfully enter the cultivation path within three months and complete the first stage of training, I’ll allow you to join the Tang Sect and learn some confidential things.”</p><p>After she had decided to hand over the second half of her life to Tang Xiu, Cheng Yannan no longer bothered herself to find out any confidential secrets and whatnot. She was just a bit surprised and wondered as to why Tang Xiu would let her cultivate and become a cultivator even though she was an ability user.</p><p>After hesitating for a short moment, Cheng Yannan finally asked to satisfy her curiosity. “Anyways, Tang Xiu. Are cultivators more powerful than ability users?”</p><p>“Hahaha.” Tang Xiu couldn’t help laughing and explained, “You see, ability users are only able to acquire some kind of superpower, but they can only display that particular superpower, whereas cultivators are wholly different. Any cultivator who has reached a certain level can even summon the force of nature, alter and manipulate the environment and time. It’s even possible for them to fly to the heavenly bodies and traverse the space in the universe.”</p><p>“Bah, that’s some boasting!” A contemptuous look painted Cheng Yannan’s face and she said, “Do you think cultivators like you are some kind of celestial immortals or something? If cultivators are so powerful, they could’ve become the Masters of Earth already.”</p><p>Tang Xiu turned his head to look at her with a vague smile. “Give me a few more years and I can easily become the Master of the whole Earth if I want to. Any human will only be able to bend their knees before me. Cultivators are far more powerful than you can imagine. It’s not impossible for them to break the shackles of this world and ascend to the Immortal World as Immortals if their cultivations keep getting stronger.”</p><p>His claim made Cheng Yannan at a loss whether she had to cry or laugh. “Have you been reading too many Xianxia novels, Tang Xiu? Or have you been brainwashed by the likes of Xianxia movies? If cultivators were really powerful, those who can cultivate would’ve become immortals already, no?”</p><p><em>Whoosh</em> !</p><p>Instead of replying, Tang Xiu directly used his ability to prove it. After dashing toward Cheng Yannan in a flash, he grabbed her slender waist and they instantly vanished from the room. In the next second, he had brought Cheng Yannan and appeared a kilometer high in the air. Despite being an ability user, Cheng Yannan only had a few experiences and could only scream out in horror.</p><p>“Gosh! Stop screaming, will you? Be careful not to get noticed by Kuwako!”</p><p>Tang Xiu looked down at the Earth and, at the same time, quietly took out two Invisibility Charms from his interspatial ring. He quickly stuck each on them. The current technology was very developed and there were surveillance satellites in the sky. He didn’t want to get caught and photographed by those satellites while flying and hugging a woman a kilometer high in the air.</p><p>Ultimately, Cheng Yannan was finally able to ease herself from her fear. Her eyes turned saucer and she looked a bit tense. She carefully gazed at the scene in all directions and asked stutteringly, “H-how… h-how d-did you… do it?”</p><p>“Hehehe.” Tang Xiu couldn’t help laughing and said, “You’ve never seen me in action, have you? Are you gonna freak out again if we fly higher?”</p><p>Cheng Yannan gasped and gulped down. She then replied with a lingering fear in her voice, “This is too unbelievable. I never thought that even Superman is inferior to you. And you… have you cultivated to the point of immortality and become a celestial immortal yourself?”</p><p>“Nah. I still have a long way to go. I can only be regarded as a slightly powerful cultivator.” Tang Xiu shook his head and said, “As for becoming a God, I’m afraid that it will still take a very long, long time. Anyways, let’s go back!”</p><p>After he finished speaking, Cheng Yannan only felt that the sky and earth were spinning around. They then returned to the spacious and bright room the moment after. She rubbed her eyes and secretly pinched her waist, only to feel pain, and was finally sure that she wasn’t dreaming.</p><p>At this moment, she looked at Tang Xiu with a face full of awe and worship. She suddenly felt that it was truly wise of her to hand over her future to Tang Xiu. She was sure that she would feel superb if she could become as powerful as him in the future.</p><p>“I also want to be a cultivator. I want to fly to the sky as easily as you do!” Cheng Yannan clenched her fists and blurted out.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
