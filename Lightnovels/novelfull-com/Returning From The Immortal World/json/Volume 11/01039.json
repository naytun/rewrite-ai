As of now, only a deep puzzle occupied Tang Xiu’s mind. What exactly was the existence of Earth? Why would so many strange pocket worlds connect to it?</p><p>However, he also realized that it was very difficult for him to figure it out in a short time no matter how long this question plagued his mind. Thus, he no longer thought about this matter and led Chen Zhizhong, Tang 28, and the rest out of Changbai Mountain quickly. Halfway on the road back, he separated from Chen Zhizhong.</p><p>“Please take care, Master. I’ll be waiting for you in Star City.”</p><p>Chen Zhizhong looked somewhat reluctant. The journey and the experience this time gave him a very deep impression that deepened his feeling towards Tang Xiu as his true Master.</p><p>“I won’t stay in the capital for a long time,” said Tang Xiu with a smile. “Go and take care of your business. I’ll take you to Nine Dragons Island after I go back.”</p><p>“Acknowledged, Master!” replied Chen Zhizhong as he left quickly.</p><p>****</p><p>Beijing.</p><p>It was the first time for Tang 28 and the other four kids visiting the capital. They all knew that Beijing was the capital of China and one of the most bustling metropolises in the country. It made them quite curious despite being much more mature than their peers.</p><p>“Where are we going, Sect Master?” asked Tang 28 after they exited the airport.</p><p>“You’re not allowed to ask any more questions later, remember that!” said Tang Xiu. “You just need to follow me wherever I go. Keep in mind that you’re my shadow later, and you four are Tang 28’s shadows. Learn to stay silent and execute my orders whenever you’re with me.”</p><p>Tang 28 and the four others hurriedly nodded and didn’t dare to speak again.</p><p>Tang Xiu’s visit to Beijing this time was due to the 80th birthday of his grandfather, Tang Guosheng. He wouldn’t have come back in a rush if he was abroad. But now that he was in China and on the way back home, he decided to stop by at the capital to congratulate the old patriarch.</p><p>As they caught a cab and Tang Xiu told the driver the Tang Family’s address, the taxi driver shot a strange look at him and asked, “You’re not from Beijing, are you, Little Brother? A curfew has been imposed on that area in recent days. Even if I send you there, I can’t get you to the address. Just stopping by and parking nearby.”</p><p>“Ehh? A curfew over there? Why?” asked Tang Xiu in surprise.</p><p>With a mystifying voice, the taxi driver replied, “Then you must be an outsider, Little Brother. So you have no idea about it. Tomorrow is the 80th birthday of the old patriarch of the Tang Family. The Tangs were very low-key in the past, but recently they are getting more and more powerful. It’s just so happened that the Tang’s old patriarch is celebrating his 80th birthday, so the Tangs seem to be preparing a great deal for something. Hence, so as to avoid anyone creating trouble, a curfew was imposed on the streets around their residence. It’s fine during the daytime, but the streets will be sealed off starting from 10 PM and no vehicles are allowed to approach the area.”</p><p>“Ah, this Tang Family seems very famous!” Tang Xiu nodded.</p><p>The taxi driver gave him “don’t speak carelessly because you’re ignorant” look. After starting the car, he spoke again. “Who doesn’t know the Tang in the entire capital, Little Brother? I bet those with a bit of power in China definitely know who Tang Xiu is. The Tang’s old patriarch used to be the elder of the nation—a real bigshot and a former general. What’s more, have you ever heard about the Tang Family’s arch-nemesis, the Yaos? The latter inexplicably fell into demise last year. I’m sure that even if the present Tang Family is not ranked as the best House in the capital, they are definitely in the top three.”</p><p>“They are that powerful?” Tang Xiu confirmed with a light smile.</p><p>The taxi driver didn’t notice Tang Xiu’s expression and kept holding the steering wheel while looking at the road ahead. He nodded and said, “Of course, they are powerful! Pity that I didn’t reincarnate into that House, though. I would’ve lived a kingly life if I were a member of the Tangs. You got no idea of how prestigious the status and identity the Tang House’s members in the capital enjoy, do you? Some time ago, a scion from the Tang House called Tang Wei smacked the renowned Heavenly Grace Club of Beijing and made a big ruckus there. Can you guess the ending? Nobody can do shit to this Prince Tang Wei. On the contrary, the Heavenly Grace Club’s Boss and the few silk pants who offended him bowed their heads to apologize to him. The grapevine has it that Young Master Tang Wei racked quite a fortune from the compensation they gave him.”</p><p>“Tang Wei?”</p><p>Tang Xiu was a bit at a loss whether he had to cry or laugh. He didn’t expect that Tang Xiu would cause such a big mess. But he was sure that no matter how big the fortune this guy got, he must have been packed up after he got home. Definitely! It was because the death decree from the elders of the Tangs saying that the juniors of the family were forbidden from acting like those silk pants and cause troubles outside.</p><p>This guy is definitely not feeling well recently, no? Tang Xiu gloated.</p><p>After half an hour, the taxi passed downtown. Just as it was crossing the flyover and coming down, there was congestion in the road ahead.</p><p>“Why is Qingfeng Road blocked again? Is there a traffic accident in front?” the taxi driver used the intercom and asked. He quickly got the answers he wanted.</p><p>“It’s because of a traffic accident. And lemme tell you, the scene is straight out of a blockbuster! Some cars were in hot pursuit and the number of victims is probably more than 10 people. It’s been a long time since such a big mess that happened in Beijing. You’re unlucky, Brother. You gotta pray for more blessings and good luck if you’re stuck in Qingfeng Road. I’m afraid you’re gonna be stuck for a few more hours.”</p><p>“Who the hell is so bold to make such a big ruckus in the capital?!” asked the cab driver hurriedly. “With so many people dying at the holy ground of the emperor, are they not afraid of getting bad luck?”</p><p>“I don’t know anything more, sorry.”</p><p>“Got it, thanks!”</p><p>As the conversation ended, the cab driver looked at Tang Xiu. Then, he forced a smile and said, “Well, it seems like we’re stuck here until morning, Little Brother. It’s impossible to turn around now either. If you’re in a hurry, you can get off now and take the subway there, though.”</p><p>Tang Xiu thought for a moment and then took out 200 yuan from his pocket and handed it over to the cab driver, saying, “Then we’re getting off here, Uncle! Take the money and keep the change.”</p><p>The cab driver didn’t expect Tang Xiu to be so generous and said quickly, “It’s too much, Little Brother. I can’t accept it.”</p><p>Tang Xiu pushed the door open and just waved with a smile. He then led Tang 28’s group of five to the roadside and then walked along the road. Back when the cab driver used the intercom to ask about the accident, he was also very curious as to who could be so bold to make such a big mess in downtown capital.</p><p>Ten minutes later, Tang Xiu and the rest appeared near the accident site—a wide intersection that now looked so chaotic with more than a dozen cars crashed. A lot of rescuers could be seen everywhere treating the wounded or lifting the dead bodies from the cars, causing him to furrow his brows slightly.</p><p>“What exactly happened here, Big Brother?”</p><p>Tang Xiu approached a middle-aged man who kept sighing and asked him after offering a cigarette.</p><p>“It’s because of those evil guys!” The middle-aged man forced a smile and explained, “Some people unknowingly offended the Second Young Master Fan. That fella brought many men with a dozen cars to chase and kill them and eventually led to these series of accidents. Alas, three of them died here and the remaining ones are injured and escaped. Yet that Second Young Master Fan didn’t let them go and led many men to pursue them, abandoning those who got implicated in a car accident.”</p><p>“Who is this Second Young Master Fan?” asked Tang Xiu, frowning.</p><p>The middle-aged man glanced at Tang Xiu and asked, “Judging from your accent and that you don’t know Second Young Master Fan, you’re not local, are you, Little Brother?”</p><p>“I really don’t know him. I’m from Star City and just came to Beijing today.” Tang Xiu shook his head.</p><p>“I see. It’s no wonder, then.” The middle-aged man nodded and explained, “Second Young Master Fan is the son of the Fan House’s Patriarch. Although no one from this family goes into politics, it’s a very famous wealthy family nonetheless. Do you know the Skypigeon Group listed in the Top 500 companies in the world? That’s the Fan Family’s company. This family had a good reputation in Beijing prior to this incident, and now that its Second Young Master caused so much a mess, I’m afraid their reputation is pretty much notorious now. Bah, if I were to have a son like him, I’d definitely break his legs and chain him at home, lest he go outside to court calamity and causes troubles.”</p><p>Tang Xiu nodded in response and asked curiously, “Where are they heading now?”</p><p>“How would I know? A group of men in hot pursuit and the other one running like hell,” said the middle-aged man. “Who knows where are they going?”</p><p>“You don’t even know which direction they are heading to?” asked Tang Xiu again.</p><p>The middle-aged man pointed to the northeast direction and said, “I know that. They’re heading there. You can’t be thinking of joining in the fray, can you, Little Brother? Don’t get yourself involved, lest you get burned! You’d better put your curiosity away.”</p><p>“Roger that and thanks a bunch, Big Brother.” Tang Xiu smiled.</p><p>Immediately after, Tang Xiu led Tang 28’s group of five and quickly rushed to the northeast. He wouldn’t have bothered to get involved in this matter if he didn’t happen to bump into this accident. But now that it happened before him, he might as well figure out what happened. He had heard of the Fan Family but hadn’t had any contact with them yet, although one of his friends, Qin Shaoyang, had.</p><p>From what he learned from Qin Shaoyang, the First Young Master of the Fan Family was his sworn brother and he intended to introduce him to Tang Xiu before. The most important thing was that the Qin Shaoyang also had a business partnership with the Fan Family that it would affect the former if an accident happened to the later.</p><p>“Hello, Shaoyang. Have you heard that the second son of the Fan Family just made a big mess?” Tang Xiu dialed Qin Shaoyang’s phone as he headed northwest.</p><p>“I heard the news about that ten minutes ago,” replied Qin Shaoyang hurriedly. “This damn Second Fan is really outrageous. He just caused such a big shit this time. I’m afraid he’ll implicate the entire Fan Family and lead them to the abyss. I’m at home now and talking to my old man about the business we have with the Fans. Alas, it seems like my family will get burnt one way or the other regardless.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
