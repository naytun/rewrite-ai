Well, it’s a pity he has some private matters to deal with and went separate ways with me for quite a long while. But the agreement time for us to meet is coming soon, so it won’t take long before he can help me to refine that Poison Furnace Pill. I won’t be the only one who gets a level stronger by then, but also this Cadaveric Beast of mine.”</p><p>Iron Raven’s complexion turned cold. He shook his head and said, “Still, it’s just impossible for his cherished Sky Origin Flag to appear in your hands if he’s still alive.”</p><p>“Why not?” replied Demonfreak with a strange smirk. “What about each drop of liquid of Sierra Creek, Myriad Streams, and Azure Ocean, then? Those were enough to make Dao Master Poison go crazy. Can’t I borrow his Sky Origin Flag for a year with those three drops of spirit liquid?”</p><p>Iron Raven’s pupils shrunk and he suddenly seemed to think of something. His face quickly turned stern and he angrily growled. “It was really you who stole the Myriad Streams liquid from me back then! I’ll make you pay a painful price even if I must die today. Everyone, heed my order! The Sky Origin Flag has sealed up the surrounding space. There’s no other choice but to fight with them since we can’t escape. It’s up to you whether you fight to kill them for that hope, or be trapped here as their prey. Choose!”</p><p>“KILL OUR WAY OUT!!!”</p><p>“KILL THEM ALL!!!”</p><p>Tens of Stygian Club’s experts all showed their determination. They were ready to risk everything now that there was the only one way out.</p><p>Demonfreak himself never thought that his reply would arouse Iron Raven’s hatred. Although he could tell that this guy would go all out in this situation, he was not afraid since he had the assistance of the Cadaveric Beast. In his mind, there was no doubt that Iron Raven would die today.</p><p>The Stygian Club would suffer enormous losses as long as Iron Raven and these tens of experts were completely annihilated. It could be said that he only added a new enmity over the old ones.</p><p>“Iron Raven, if Dao Master Poison comes back and knows that I’ve killed you, I’m hella sure his face will look wonderful! Hahaha… you know, he’s been swearing all the time he will cut your head off himself and use your skull as a shit-pot!”</p><p>In the building nearby, Tang Xiu watched the unfolding battle scene at the Speeder’s HQ through the binoculars. He could still hear their voices even though the speakers were invisible.</p><p><em>‘Dao Master Poison, huh?’</em></p><p>His mouth curved and formed a devilish smile. He secretly felt sorry for that Demonfreak geezer inwardly since he had directly killed Dao Master Poison back when in the Western China region. It meant this geezer wouldn’t be able to count on this dead guy anymore in the future.</p><p><em>‘That’s not correct, though! It can still be done!’</em></p><p>Tang Xiu secretly felt amused inwardly because such a method was impossible in the world of the living. That Demonfreak geezer could still find Dao Master Poison if he went to Hell! But uncannily, though, it was on the premise if there was another Dao Master Poison in the Netherworld.</p><p>“Your luck is really great today, guys.” He turned his head and glanced at a few people around him with a faint smile.</p><p>“Uh… why do you say our luck is good, Sect Master?” Mo Awu was confounded.</p><p>“Well, I was kind of worried that if either of them suffered heavy losses, it would directly lead their men to escape before the battle concluded. It would’ve been quite a hassle since we’d have to spend quite some time and energy to kill them ourselves. But it looks like we won’t need to act at all. They have been trapped in that array and only a dead-end awaits them unless those Stygian Club people can break that flag array,” explained Tang Xiu.</p><p>“Then our luck is indeed really great.” Mo Awu nodded.</p><p>“That’s not what I meant.” Tang Xiu shook his head and said, “What I mean is not the outcome of the battle but those two old geezers. After they all die and if I can smash their Golden Cores when I refine the Sanguine Pill, the pill’s effect can be improved as a result, so your cultivation can directly breakthrough after you take the pill. You can even advance two levels in one go if your luck is really good.”</p><p><em>‘Two levels?’</em></p><p>Mo Awu, Hao Lei, and Kuwako Yamamoto didn’t feel like it would matter much to them, but Tang Guang and Tang An looked pleasantly surprised. Advancing two levels meant that they could directly enter the Nascent Soul Stage!</p><p>That was the Nascent Soul Stage—a cultivation level they had long been dreaming of reaching.</p><p>Tang Xiu wasn’t in a hurry and quietly watched the fighting at the Speeder’s HQ building. As both sides crazily charged and sent their deadly blows, an expert finally died tragically while his counterpart was gravely injured. It was a fight where both sides must pay a grievous price to eliminate each other. Meanwhile, the showdown between Iron Raven against Demonfreak and his python companion was about to reach its closing time.</p><p>Finally, Iron Raven didn’t end up the victor. After giving the geezer Demonfreak grave wounds, he ended up dead with his head torn off by the python, with his body falling to the cold concrete floor.</p><p>“Kill the remaining enemies, Cadaveric Beast!”</p><p>The grotesque geezer was seriously injured. His mood was elevated after killing Iron Raven, but he no longer joined the fight and just directly ordered the severely injured python instead. He then landed on the roof of the building and sat cross-legged to heal himself.</p><p>“It’s time to start!”</p><p>Tang Xiu stamped his feet and his handsome face looked satisfied. Suddenly, the Bloodseed Array appeared out of the blue, covering the black aura from the flag array within.</p><p>“What’s going on?!”</p><p>The grotesque old man was startled. His eyes that had just closed, abruptly opened as he looked up at the sky. He was keenly aware that the fluctuations in the surrounding atmosphere were so strong as though there were enemies coming in all directions—a sensation that made his heart sink.</p><p><em>Whoosh…</em></p><p>A figure flickered and instantly appeared in front of him. A stalwart man in a night-black suit reported in panic. “We’re surrounded, and some red light is in the air around. It’s like… an array… just like the flag array.”</p><p>The Demonfreak geezer was shaken inwardly. He instantly streaked up into the sky. When he bolted upward to the height of hundreds of meters, he looked around, only to have his heart chilled further. It was because he could also see traces of red lines of energy shield.</p><p>“Who is it? Get out!” screamed out the geezer.</p><p>“Hehehe…”</p><p>Tang Xiu appeared out of thin air in front of the geezer. A porcelain bottle then appeared in his hand as he unplugged it and sized up the grotesque Demonfreak smilingly. “You’re called Demonfreak geezer, yes? You truly are a fossilized devil who can kill without batting an eye. Countless people must’ve died in your hands for so many years. Truly an abominable scourge! What’s up with that face, though? Is this porcelain bottle in my hand familiar to you?”</p><p>Demonfreak geezer slightly trembled and sternly shouted, “That’s a porcelain bottle specially made by Dao Master Poison to store poison. How… the hell… did you get it? Did you get it from Dao Master Poison?”</p><p>Giving a thumbs-up, Tang Xiu praised. “I never thought your relationship with Dao Master Poison was this good. You can even identify such minutiae from him like this specially made porcelain bottle. Take it easy since I’m already here, though. You should have a one-in-a-million chance to see him later after I kill you.”</p><p>Disbelief was all over Demonfreak’s face. “You… you killed him? Who the hell are you?”</p><p>“Well, who I am is not that important, no?” Tang Xiu lightly smiled and said, “You only need to know that you’ll be killed soon, and I’ll refine your flesh and blood into some pills, though I’ll need assistance from your Golden Core to make its effect better.”</p><p>“What did you say?!!”</p><p>Demonfreak glared at Tang Xiu as though he was looking at a loony. Although he keenly sensed a very powerful aura from the young man in front, he just couldn’t believe that this man would be able to kill him, let alone use his flesh and blood to refine pills.</p><p>“SOME OF YOU, KILL HIM!!”</p><p><em>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</em></p><p>Eight lightning-like figures bolted from the distance and appeared around Tang Xiu in the blink of an eye. Just as they gripped their weapons and were about to attack Tang Xiu, layers of ripples suddenly appeared in the air as an immortal sword appeared out of the blue and slew four of them directly.</p><p>“WHAT?!”</p><p>The grotesque old man was struck dumb with amazement upon seeing such a bizarre scene. He couldn’t help shivering, whereas the other four stalwart men in black night suits looked terrified, one of whom was so frightened that he straightly made to escape.</p><p><em>Puff…</em></p><p>The immortal sword impaled that burly man’s back and pierced through his chest. As Tang An’s figure emerged out of thin air, a sharp dagger appeared and slashed the throats of the other three burly men and then pierced their hearts. The blitzkrieg strikes with extreme speed simply left no chance for them to react.</p><p>Tang Xiu stretched his arms open and laughed aloud. “Annihilate them all!”</p><p>“KILL!”</p><p>Tang Guang, Mo Awu, Hao Lei, Kuwako Yamamoto, including Tang 28, directly charged forward and directly launched fierce attacks against Demonfreak’s men. Aside from Tang 28, who was the weakest at the mid-stage Foundation Establishment, the rest were all Golden Core Stage experts. Killing these people was as easy as killing chickens to them.</p><p>“Hey, Tom! Get your ass off into action, will you?” Tang Xiu laughed. “You can’t join the fight here, but do take care of the Ravengale’s nest! Awu, go with Tom and make sure to clean up all the underground forces in Saipan in two days!”</p><p>“Roger!”</p><p>“Understood!”</p><p>Tom Reggie, who was a kilometer away, heard Tang Xiu’s order clearly. After a respectful reply, he led his men and lots of others from the Golden Cauldron away. Mo Awu, who had just joined the fray a moment ago, could only reluctantly give up attacking the enemies. He then bolted away to follow Tom Reggie.</p><p>Tang Xiu flew upward and stood in mid-air. Then, he let out a smile and spoke out in a clear voice, “Life and livelihood of the universe turn the Yin and Yang upside down. Let the world turn into an array and shall the array serve as a furnace. O’ the flesh and bones of the dead… shall your souls be extinguished and returned!”</p><p>Within the coverage of the Bloodseed Array, a batch of corpses rose up and floated tens of meters in the air. Each drop of their blood flowing from the remains floated slowly and eventually condensed just like a waterfall formed by blood water.</p><p>The day bleeds… and the world is full of blood.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
