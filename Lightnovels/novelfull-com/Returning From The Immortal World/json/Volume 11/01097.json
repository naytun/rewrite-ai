He felt that the battle between the Ravengale and the Speeder was about to come to an end. Should they act now, it was sure that the Ravengale would suffer huge losses and even more likely to be wiped out here and now.</p><p>And yet, he just couldn’t understand why Tang Xiu didn’t order to strike now. It was equal to losing this golden opportunity. It must be noted that those Ravengale experts would likely have a breathing time after slaying all those from the Speeder Union. Even if they were able to make a short adjustment, the difficulty in killing them would very likely increase as a result.</p><p>He didn’t dare to go against Tang Xiu’s order, so he could only make a helpless face. He grabbed the binoculars again to observe the battle situation in the Speeder’s HQ.</p><p>Suddenly, his face slightly shifted and he looked a bit surprised. He lowered his binoculars and quickly glanced at Tang Xiu before observing again. He had already seen some flat spots near the sewers of the Speeder Union’s HQ. They were pushed open and some figures rushed out from the inside.</p><p>Immediately after, a scene Tom Reggie had never dreamed of took place. Those lightning-fast figures dashed through the building where they were observing. Clad in black night suits and with long blades on their backs, their movements were as fast as a lightning bolt; the evidence that they were powerful experts.</p><p>In the air, Iron Raven had just delivered the final blow and killed two St. James experts. As he was about to lead the two Gold-rank Assassins into the Speeder Union’s HQ, he never thought that a third party was going to strike them at this moment, more so with so many experts surrounding them. Given their actions, it was apparent that they came with malice.</p><p>“Who are you, people?” Iron Raven’s voice was particularly stern and hoarse, just like a crow’s voice.</p><p>The mouth-scarred old man with a python wrapped his waist seemed not to be affected by the show of the latter’s fight mid-air. He appeared outside the Speeder’s HQ and spoke in sarcasm, “Well, I never thought you would show up in such a remote place such as Taipan, Iron Raven. It’s been decades since our last meeting, hasn’t it? You know, you gave me quite a headache back then, so it’s best to calculate that old debt first today, shall we?”</p><p>A cold light flashed across Iron Raven’s eyes. He stared at the coming man and an ugly smile was pictured on his face immediately. Letting out a strange gaga voice, he said, “Well, well. Look who it is? The Evil Wind Sect’s Old Demonfreak, huh? Where’s your fossil crony Dao Master Poison, though? Just call him out. It’s not that difficult to kill such suicidal clowns like you two.”</p><p>The old Demonfreak smilingly said, “Been a long time since I saw that old fossil Dao Master Poison. But he just lost his qualification to be my partner since he hasn’t broken through the hurdle, though. Yet, you truly are beyond my expectations, to think that you are actually more powerful than before. But you know, I won’t spare any shit talk with you anymore since you’re gonna die today!”</p><p>“Well, that’s just like you, Old Demonfreak. So ruthless.” Iron Raven bizarrely smirked. “Anyway, do you really not know that Dao Master Poison has already broken through the last hurdle, though? It seems to me that it wasn’t you who threw him off, but it was him instead.”</p><p>Demonfreak stared blankly and then growled furiously. “FART! How the hell did I, his former companion, not know his level of power, shithole? Beware of your fucking words, Iron Raven! Lest I mutilate you and feed you to raise my giant phyton!”</p><p>In response, Iron Raven smiled disdainfully. His gaze landed on the giant python around Demonfreak’s waist. His pupils suddenly shrunk with disbelief and he shouted aloud, “Demonfreak… you… you have really refined that Cadaveric Beast? Damn! I thought the Stygian Club’s people were the only ones like Demon Kings that never bat an eye when killing people. It turns out that we’re meek compared to you. How many people have you killed to feed your Cadaveric Beast all these years?”</p><p>“Well, well. I never thought you’d see me through.” Demonfreak affirmed his conjecture. “I’ve killed so many people—true. But how could I remember the exact number? Should it exceed five digits? Hahaha… You know what, Iron Raven? This Cadaveric Beast is as powerful as me. Do you think you got any possibility to survive today?”</p><p>Iron Raven’s face enormously changed. He turned his head and shouted, “Hurry up and kill the remaining enemies and retreat at once!! This fucking fossil is not easy to deal with!”</p><p>Hearing Iron Raven’s shout, the old Demonfreak smiled more fervently. Stroking the python’s head, he laughed wildly. “Hahaha… kill them! Kill as many of those young Stygian rabbits as you can! I’m so happy today. I can use the Iron Raven’s heart and liver to feed my Cadaveric Beast. Mark my words! Kill more and get more rewards from me!”</p><p>Those men under Demonfreak immediately looked excited upon hearing his statement. Each and every one of them milked out all their strength and fiercely attacked the Stygian Club experts.</p><p><em>Puff, puff, puff…</em></p><p>Although these men under Demonfreak were not amazingly strong, they were much stronger than some experts at the martial arts grandmaster level. Some experts of Stygian Club were very strong, but many of their Ravengale’s counterparts were just average people. Many of whom met their deaths immediately after getting besieged by them.</p><p>In a nearby building, Tom Reggie finally understood why Tang Xiu didn’t order an attack. It turned out that they were not the only party waiting to benefit from the clash of two parties since yet another oriole was behind them too.</p><p>“So… we have become hunters?”</p><p>Putting down the binoculars, Tom Reggie looked at Tang Xiu with worship. His confusion was all gone instantly at this moment. He could hardly imagine what their situation would be like, had Tang Xiu ordered to attack a while ago, where some other forces appeared right after they annihilated the Ravengale’s people. At that time, even if they could eliminate all of them, it was very likely their own losses would increase several times.</p><p>Tang Xiu also put down the binoculars at this time. A thoughtful look appeared on his face as he suddenly turned his head and looked at the people behind, asking, “If I were to offer you guys some heterodox pills, will you take it or not?”</p><p>‘Heterodox pills?!’</p><p>Tang Guang, Mo Awu, and the rest were confused and looked at Tang Xiu with puzzled looks.</p><p>“It’s a Sanguine Pill—a pill made by using the blood that just flowed out of the deceased and the energy left by the dissipation of their souls,” said Tang Xiu coolly. “The caveat is that your mind and soul will be under intense attack from the resentment of the dead. If you have a weak willpower, you’ll likely suffer a qi deviation. But of course, if you’re able to control your heart and mind, it will be greatly beneficial to you since taking one Sanguine Pill is even better than taking more than ten Essence Amassing Pills.”</p><p>Tang Guang, Mo Awu, and the rest exchanged dismayed glances. They were somewhat interested, yet not immediately expressed their opinions.</p><p>After all, just as Tang Xiu said, this was a sinister heterodox pill, to begin with. However, they knew Tang Xiu was not an evil man. If they were to take this pill, could some latent dangers be waiting for them in the future?</p><p>As if seeing through their minds, Tang Xiu nodded. “That’s correct. Even if your willpower defeats all the evil thoughts you’ll face after taking this Sanguine Pill, it’s likely there will be some sequelae backlashes in the form of vulnerability to a mental demon in your future cultivation. Yet, such mental demon and evil nature are something we must always guard against in our cultivation.”</p><p>Mo Awu pondered for a moment and then spoke, “We will listen to you, Sect Master. You wish us to take this Sanguine Pill, so we shall take it immediately, and we’ll never do otherwise if you forbid us to do so. We believe that you’ll never harm us, Sect Master.”</p><p>Tang Xiu was at a loss whether he had to cry or laugh. He just rolled his eyes, shook his head and smilingly said, “You’re so silly. It never occurred to me that you’re this careful and just threw the ball back to me. Alright, so as to further your cultivation, all of you should take a Sanguine Pill.”</p><p>Having said that, Tang Xiu suddenly noticed Tom Reggie’s anticipating look as he turned his head. He immediately let out a strange expression and sized him up, asking, “Do you wanna take this Sanguine Pill, by chance?”</p><p>“Ugh… can I take it, Boss?” Tom Reggie let out a dry smile.</p><p>Tang Xiu chuckled and smilingly said, “Of course, Tom. But you’re too weak now. Your body will just explode due to huge energy if you take it directly. But well, I’ll make you one too, since you’re fated to be here today. No worries. I’ll protect you, so you can directly step into the ranks of cultivators and become a true one, got it?”</p><p>Tom Reggie’s eyes lit up with a grateful look. If he had to, he was all ready to kneel and lick boots. Becoming a true cultivator who sought the path to immortality was something he had been dreaming of recently. He had seen Tang Xiu’s power and how greatly powerful Mo Awu and the rest were. Therefore, he also wanted to have the ability to fly and kill from far away.</p><p>“Anyways, keep observing the battle for now and tell everyone else to hide.” Tang Xiu smiled. “Tell them not to expose any trace before the outcome of their battles concludes. I’m going to arrange an array here. This place will perhaps become a blessed land since there so many experts are fighting, bleeding, and dying here. No matter if it’s a blade of grass or a grain of sand, everything can be a very important resource for cultivation as long as it can be used well.”</p><p>‘A blade of grass… and… a grain of sand?!’</p><p>Mo Awu, Tang Guang, and some others let out hollow laughs. Their current level of power was very low and thus, they were unable to understand that “a blade of grass and a grain of sand” mentioned by Tang Xiu could become a principal idea of cultivation resources. So much so that even if they couldn’t concoct pills, they could chew immortal grass and swallow it if they were to encounter one; just like they could only become a hatchet man to pound people should they get some precious minerals at hands.</p><p>In the air, a weak change in the stream of qi around made Tang Xiu immediately raise his vigilance. But after he released his perception and found that the fluctuation was caused by Tang An, he immediately let out a smile. He retracted back his spiritual sense and asked, “Well, how is your progress in array study recently?”</p><p>Tang An’s figure appeared out of the blue by Tang Xiu’s side and respectfully answered, “The progress is not bad, but I temporarily put down some of the contents I don’t understand and continued on the other arrays. I usually go to the Master later and ask her about them.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
