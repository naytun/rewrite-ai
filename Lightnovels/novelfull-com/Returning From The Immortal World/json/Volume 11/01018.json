This guy had just leaped into the Qi Refining Stage that was even much weaker than the first batch of homeless children’s cultivation level. Tang Xiu could imagine a very interesting scene after he sent this guy to train with the children he had been fostering on Clam Island.</p><p>“It’s getting late. It’s time for me to go back and rest.”</p><p>“No rush, Brother. I still got something to tell you,” said Ouyang Lei quickly.</p><p>“Pray tell,” replied Tang Xiu.</p><p>“My family just got a treasure recently, but all my relatives can’t figure out what it is. We have even invited various domestic antique experts and famous collectors, yet none of them managed to get a clue. Ah, there were also some famous figures from the Occult Sect who tried to examine it but to no avail. Can you help me identify it?” asked Ouyang Lei.</p><p>“Ehh? Why are you so sure to call it a treasure even though you can’t identify it?” asked Tang Xiu with a surprised face.</p><p>“I dunno what it is, but that thing is definitely a treasure. I just know it.” Ouyang Lei proudly said, “Do you know what material it’s made from? The scientists said that it was made from some alien meteorite or something. Moreover, it’s not some kind of ordinary meteorite but one that contains rich energy substances.”</p><p>“Is it as in a lump meteorite or what?” asked Tang Xiu.</p><p>“Naturally not, Dude.” Ouyang Lei shook his head and said, “It’s an oval-shaped container with many patterns etched on it, kinda similar to some bizarre runes or something. Unfortunately, even the most famous historian in China couldn’t figure out the content of those runes.”</p><p>Tang Xiu’s curiosity perked up and he asked, “Where’s it? Lemme take a look at it.”</p><p>Ouyang Lei said, “It’s stored in my family’s vault. Let’s head to my house then, shall we?”</p><p>Tang Xiu slightly furrowed his brows since he’d rather not go to the Ouyang’s.</p><p>‘Lulu may have become my woman, yet I couldn’t give status nor marry her. Wouldn’t it be too embarrassing if I were to visit them with my son-in-law status?’</p><p>He pondered for a moment and then said, “Brother Lei, I still got some important things to do in the Everlasting Feast Hall, so I gotta go there first. Also, it’s so late at night and it’s kinda inappropriate to visit your family home at this time, no? How about you bring that treasure to the Everlasting Feast Hall? I’m gonna deal with my things first and will be waiting for you there afterward, how about it?”</p><p>Ouyang Lei gave it a thought. It was indeed inappropriate for Tang Xiu to follow him to his family’s residence in the middle of the night. Thus, he nodded and said, “Well, I’m fine with that. Then, I’ll go to the Everlasting Feast Hall with that treasure later.”</p><p>****</p><p>At the countryside stud farm.</p><p>In a western-styled villa, Guo Fugui was sleeping soundly with two fair-skinned pretty girls like kittens in his arms. Their white thighs and arms were like octopus tentacles that wrapped around his body.</p><p>Ring, ring, ring…</p><p>The rapid ringtone of his mobile phone broke the silence amid the darkness and woke Guo Fugui up. A scowl appeared on his face as he shoved the two girls’ limbs. Then, he grabbed the phone on the bedside table and looked at the caller. After picking it up, he angrily cursed. “Do you fucking wanna die, Hao Zi? It’s so late at night, for fuck sake. Don’t you already know I hate to be disturbed when sleeping?!!”</p><p>“Things went wrong, Boss,” the voice from the phone replied in a low voice.</p><p>Guo Fugui looked vacant for a moment. He turned to look at the two girls sitting up with blurry and dazed eyes. Then, got out of bed and walked to the window, asking in a low voice, “What happened?”</p><p>“We caught Yang Yan along with Yang Fei, her younger brother, in the Bay Port where the Ouyang’s luxurious cruiser is docked, boss. But the Paradise Club’s General Manager, Ouyang Yun, intervened all of a sudden and took them back by force. We’re still here, but Ouyang Yun seems to have given them to someone,” replied the low voice from the phone again.</p><p>The Ouyang’s Ouyang Yun?</p><p>A cold light flashed in Guo Fugui’s eyes. He used to fear the Ouyangs since this family was one of the most powerful families in Jingmen Island with a deep background. Yet now, he no longer feared them and just dreaded them at most.</p><p>The Huang Family from the Fukang Province was his backer, as his sister married to a prominent junior of the Huangs last year, so he and the Huangs were now relatives. Moreover, sending his men to chase Yang Yan was also in line with the Huang Family’s intention, and they wouldn’t stay still if the Ouyangs were to deal with him.</p><p>“Where are they now?”</p><p>“They have been taken away. I sent some men to follow and snatch them halfway, but the other party has outstanding counter detection measures and shook us off after detecting our tracks. I brought some men back to the Bay Port to keep tabs on the Ouyangs and the person who brought the Yang siblings away.”</p><p>“Trash! Wait for me there. I’ll be over shortly.” Guo Fugui cursed coldly.</p><p>“But Boss, Ouyang Lei just came and entered the Paradise Club. If you come here in person, in case…”</p><p>Ouyang Lei? Why did he go over? What exactly is the identity of the person who wants to save the Yang siblings? To think that he can make Ouyang Lei come over in the middle of the night? Could it be that his background is much more powerful than the Ouyangs?</p><p>As Guo Fugui fell into silence and then was about to speak, the voice came out of the phone again suddenly:</p><p>“Boss, Ouyang Lei just came out with a young man. They are going to leave the Paradise Club from the looks of it. What should I do? Should we follow the young man?”</p><p>“Track them and figure out who they are!”</p><p>“Acknowledged!”</p><p>Guo Fugui hung up the phone. His sleepiness had completely disappeared, but his eyes were glittering with a thoughtful look, silently analyzing the key issues of this matter.</p><p>He was instructed by the Huang Patriarch to find and chase Zuo Qing! In the end, this woman had been able to leave Jingmen Island secretly with Yang Yan’s help, making him fail to accomplish the Huang Family’s request, thus smearing his face towards the Huang Family’s patriarch.</p><p>This was the cause of this hatred for Yang Yan, since she was the one who helped Zuo Qing. Thus, he sent his men to investigate her identity and background. He also sent many men to chase and kill her. Unfortunately, that cunning woman was able to escape and they had not been able to capture her even after several days.</p><p>At thirty past three in the morning, Tang Xiu and Mo Awu rushed to the Everlasting Feast Hall’s headquarters. Most of the members had left for Nine Dragons Island, so there were only a dozen members staying here, although Gu Xiaxue had returned back ahead of time.</p><p>“You’re staying here, Awu.”</p><p>As they came to the parking lot, Tang Xiu issued an order and walked towards the beach. Just as he arrived there, he saw Gu Xiaoxue sitting cross-legged in cultivation on a lone boat on the sea under the starlight. Tang Xiu let out a faint smile and floated upward, appearing on the boat’s bow in a flash.</p><p>“Grand Master,” called out Gu Xiaoxue immediately with a pleasantly surprised look.</p><p>“So diligent. That’s great!” Tang Xiu nodded at her and said, “However, Tang Guang and Tang An are now stronger than you, so you need to work harder to advance to the late-stage of Golden Core earlier.”</p><p>“I’ll work harder, Grand Master.” Gu Xiaoxue nodded.</p><p>Tang Xiu let out a faint smile again and looked at the sea in front. He immediately cast a secret art as a stream of qi entered the sea surface. In but a moment, the sea split and created a passageway. A white-clad Gu Yan’er then jumped out lightning-fast and instantly appeared in front of Tang Xiu.</p><p>“Master!”</p><p>Gu Yan’er seemed like a young girl as she let out crisp laughter and swiftly held Tang Xiu’s arm.</p><p>“Get prepared to leave this place!” said Tang Xiu smilingly. “I’ve already arranged an array in the waters near Nine Dragons Island suitable for the exquisite pagoda.”</p><p>“Are you also going to stay in Nine Dragons Island in the future, Master?” asked Gu Yan’er with a smile.</p><p>“I still got a lot of things to do, so I can’t stay in Nine Dragons Island for the time being.” Tang Xiu shook his head. “But I’ll be there any time soon to remove all the enemies who dare eye the island.”</p><p>“They are nothing but insects to me, Master. Just tell who the enemies are. I can kill them easily,” Gu Yan’er chuckled and replied lightly.</p><p>“I can’t let you do that. Earth is a too peaceful place to live nowadays and rather unsuitable to train our talents.” Tang Xiu shook his head. “I want our men to deal with the enemies and survive on the border of life and death. Those who survive will have the qualifications to follow us in the future.”</p><p>“As you wish, Master,” replied Gu Yan’er smilingly.</p><p>Tang Xiu stretched his hand to stroke her long black hair and said with a smile, “Anyways, I’m going to found a sect there and am thinking of a name. Do you have any opinions about it?”</p><p>“Why do you have to ask, Master? All Yan’er has is all yours,” said Gu Yan’er bluntly. “Besides, I found the Everlasting Feast Hall and trained a group of talents to help me find you as the main purpose. Now that I’ve found you, they mean nothing much to me.”</p><p>“No. They are our people, Yan’er.” Tang Xiu shook his head and said, “I know what you think, but you must remember something. You raised them up and taught them. They are equal to family now. You also know what identity I once had. And yet I neglected one aspect—the more people we have, the more powerful we are. If I had followers who followed me all the way to the apex all around me back then, those bastards wouldn’t have had any chance to scheme against me.”</p><p>His statement made Gu Yan’er’s eyes glitter with a thoughtful look as she silently nodded and said, “I’ll keep your words in mind, Master.”</p><p>Tang Xiu looked up at the starry sky. His deep eyes seemed to be able to pierce through the layers of clouds and shoot through space, as if he was seeing the magnificent scenes of the vast Immortal World, gazing at his enemies who also kept progressing and advancing.</p><p>And yet, there was no dread nor fear in his heart. He was once a Supreme in the Immortal World and possessed millenniums of knowledge as well as the Heavenly Art of Cosmic Genesis as his greatest advantage—the top cultivation art of the Demon God. He once spent 8,000 years to reach Supremacy. He was confident he would only need a shorter time to make a comeback now.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
