The continuous arrival of groups of people to this place tonight was just a surprise. And now, another group with so many people came again. Could it be that they also wanted to join in the fray?</p><p>“Are they Tang Xiu’s men, or Singkuo’s?”</p><p>“Take a look at the limo in the middle, Boss,” added the middle-aged man. “It looks like Kanaja’s car!”</p><p>The dull look fleeted on Zuo Daquan’s face as it was replaced with incredulity. He spoke out, “You’re right. That must be Kanaja’s since he’s the only one who has this type of limousine in Bangkok. But what is he coming here for? There’s no way he’ll be able to join this kind of battle given his resources and ability.”</p><p>“Could it be that he’s come here for us and not because of those people?” asked the middle-aged man again.</p><p>The notion made Zuo Daquan frown deeply. He carefully gave it some thought for two minutes before he shook his head, saying, “It’s unlikely. The debt deadline is not due yet, and he won’t trouble us as he has yet to get the money back. There’s no reason for him to come to me at this time. My guess is he must’ve been involved with those who just battled, but not Tang Xiu I think.”</p><p>“Why’s that?” asked the middle-aged man, confused.</p><p>“Tang Xiu wouldn’t have come to our place to stay here after he entered Bangkok illegally in secret if he had a deep friendship with Kanaja. That’s why,” said Zuo Daquan. “Kanaja is a definite leader of Bangkok’s underground forces. The places he has for such purposes may be more covert and safer than ours.”</p><p>At the coconut plantation entrance.</p><p>After more than ten cars slowly stopped and parked, Kanaja got out from the limo in the middle of the convoy. As he walked to the interior of the estate and saw the scene in the surroundings, a stunned look covered his face and disbelief overflowed in his eyes.</p><p>“God! This place was fine when I came here yesterday. How can it be in such ruin now? It’s like… some terrorist organization just attacked this place? But even if they used bombs, it’s just impossible to be this ruined!” a black-suited big man with a scar on his face exclaimed in horror and shock.</p><p>Kanaja knitted his brows and asked in a deep voice, “You mean this place was still fine yesterday and became like this today?”</p><p>“Yeah.” The man nodded and said, “It was just fine yesterday and now has turned into ruin.”</p><p>Eyes gleaming, Kanaja realized that it must be the outcome of the battle between Tang Xiu and Singkuo’s group which had ruined Zuo Daquan’s site. He already knew that Tang Xiu’s side was very strong, while Singkuo’s side contained all the Dark Shaman Clan’s practitioners who also had similarly powerful strength. But the scene made it obvious that their power was far from what he had imagined.</p><p>However, with this place destroyed, what about the outcome of their battle? Who ended up the victor? Tang Xiu and Singluen, or Singkuo?</p><p>Whoosh…</p><p>A figure flashed and appeared in front of Kanaja and his men. The man didn’t even flinch upon having guns trained at him and just asked in a deep voice, saying, “Who’s Kanaja?”</p><p>Kanaja raised his hand to stop his men. He paced forward and said, “I am Kanaja. May I know who you’re, Mister?”</p><p>The black-robed young man with the magic staff said in a deep voice, “I’m Young Master Singluen’s subordinate. He and Mr. Tang are currently after Singkuo and some other enemies with the rest. Mr. Tang ordered me to wait for you here to pass his message. He said he needs your assistance.”</p><p>Chasing enemies?!</p><p>In an instant, Kanaja knew that Tang Xiu must have won the battle against Singkuo. He then put on a bit of respectful expression and asked, “And exactly what assistance could I offer Mr. Tang?”</p><p>“He said that the battle with Singkuo’s side has ruined this place, something that can’t be justified. He hopes that Mr. Kanaja can help in dealing with the aftermath,” said the youth. “He’d like Mr. Kan to explain this incident to Zuo Daquan, cremate all the dead bodies, and rebuild this coconut plantation. He’ll reimburse the rebuilding cost.”</p><p>Only then did Kanaja understand Tang Xiu’s intention. His smile grew wider, and he crisply replied, “Please tell Mr. Tang that I have a little friendship with this coconut plantation’s owner, so Zuo Daquan will naturally give me face. I’ll assign some men to deal with these dead bodies, but there’s no need for Mr. Tang to reimburse the reconstruction cost for the plantation. It will be a gift for his victory.”</p><p>“If so, then I’ll pass your message to Mr. Tang. I will trouble you with all that.” The youth nodded and said, “Anyway, I still need to gather with the rest, so I shall take my leave.”</p><p>Kanaja nodded and watched the youth leave quickly. His smile turned much wider, and he eventually let out a loud laugh, saying, “This is great! Very great! Men, get your ass moving and work! Clean up all the dead bodies here and leave no trace!”</p><p>With that said, he took out his cell phone and searched for Zuo Daquan’s number before dialing it.</p><p>A few kilometers away, atop the tens of meters high water tower, Zuo Daquan was still observing Kanaja through binoculars as he heard his mobile phone in the pocket suddenly ring.</p><p>“Huh? A call? Kanaja is also calling now, could it be…”</p><p>He then took his cell phone out and looked at the caller on the screen. He immediately frowned and said, “It’s really Kanaja. It’s him who called me, but what exactly does he want?”</p><p>“Don’t pick up the call at this time, Boss,” said the middle-aged man.</p><p>Zuo Daquan thought for a moment and shook his head. “No, it will be bad if I don’t pick it up. Besides, Kanaja doesn’t know where we’re hiding at now, so I’ll pick up his call to figure out his purpose.”</p><p>Having said that, he pressed the answer button and smilingly said, “What’s up calling me this early, Mr. Kan?</p><p>“Zuo Daquan, I’m outside your coconut plantation now. Immediately come here to meet me if you’ve got nothing to do,” said Kanaja.</p><p>“If you’re there, then you must know what it has become, Mr. Kan,” replied Zuo Daquan bitterly after a moment of silence. “I took my men to flee when I noticed something before my place turned like hell. I don’t wanna die by going there now!”</p><p>“Hey, I dunno why Mr. Tang picked your place as a battlefield, but I tell you that I’m not coming to your place for troubles,” said Kanaja coldly. “He entrusted me to deal with the collateral damage here. You can be sure that I’ll take over this coconut plantation if you don’t move your ass here!”</p><p>Helping Tang Xiu?!</p><p>Zuo Daquan’s complexion change with a look of incredulity. He just couldn’t understand one thing. Tang Xiu definitely knew Kanaja and they seemed to be on good terms. Yet, why did he follow his daughter to hide in his place before then?</p><p>‘Hold it!’</p><p>A thought popped up in his mind and he suddenly understood one thing. Kanaja was indeed the Godfather of Bangkok’s underground forces, yet he had too many people under him with their own vested interests. For fear that some people under Kanaja sold his whereabouts, then he came to him—a bystander?</p><p>As he thought up to this point, only then did he truly regret that he refused Tang Xiu before. He cleared his throat and replied back, “Please wait for 10 minutes, Mr. Kan. I’ll catch up with you there. Frankly, Mr. Tang has a good friendship with my daughter and I’ll help you too since he needs your assistance.”</p><p>A confused look flashed in Kanaja’s eyes. He didn’t expect Tang Xiu to have a good friendship with Zuo Daquan’s daughter at all. Apparently, the way he treated Zuo Daquan must change later.</p><p>Five-plus kilometers away.</p><p>Tang Xiu led the troops and finally arrived to where Tang An was coughing up blood. The murderous intent in his eyes turned more intense as he instantly controlled the divine sword and flashed forward toward the enemy lightning fast.</p><p>“Array on! You all must die!”</p><p>The divine sword transformed into layers of thousands of sword images as they torrentially steamrolled forward toward Death Dhyana Buddhist Master’s group of seven. This time, Tang Xiu no longer held back and unleashed all his power. His figure appeared over a hundred meters in the air the moment the thousands of sword images struck forward and cast various spells and techniques. Groups of flames emerged and encaged the area tens of kilometers in the surroundings, while series of lightning bolts came blasting down from the sky through the sea of fire.</p><p>Shoo, shoo, shoo…</p><p>He then took out eight array disks from his interspatial ring and quickly threw each into eight directions. At the same time, he made use of the street intersections, surrounding trees, street lights, and the small artificial lake on the left side to arrange the Octagonal Desolation Array.</p><p>Simple yet intricate runes formed the array pattern that quickly transformed into one whole shape with interlaced lines of runes emitting vague energy fluctuations. In just ten seconds, Death Dhyana Buddhist Master and his group were stranded inside the newly arranged array.</p><p>“JIN SHI!”</p><p>Tang Xiu shouted as the Octagonal Desolation Array activated and completely encaged the surrounding area.</p><p>Jin Shi instantly appeared before Tang Xiu and respectfully asked, “Your command, Boss?”</p><p>“You have read many ancient scriptures and several books of arrays that I wrote during your time with me, and you’ve studied them, haven’t you?” asked Tang Xiu. “Can you recognize what kind of array this is?”</p><p>Jin Shi was stunned and looked dull for a moment. Although he had studied a lot of content about arrays, he had yet to arrange any basic array and rarely saw any of them in reality. He immediately glanced around at the array and spent 10 minutes thinking about it. Afterwards, he answered with a guess, “Judging from the route, pattern and outlined runes, everything is similar to the Octagonal Desolation Array, isn’t it, Boss?”</p><p>“You’re good!” Tang Xiu nodded and said, “You can recognize this array, so you know only one person can enter and control it. Can you control it smoothly and kill them with it?”</p><p>“I can do it!” Jin Shi nodded with a serious face.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
