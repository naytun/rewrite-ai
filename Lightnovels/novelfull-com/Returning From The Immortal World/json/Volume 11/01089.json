It was already October, yet the hot weather still lingered around Jingmen Island.</p><p>At 6 PM, two black Audis slowly entered the Everlasting Feast Hall’s site and the supervisor of the restaurant quickly walked forward to greet Duanmu Lin who just got off the car, as well as the high-level officials from the Special Abilities Bureau. The group then was brought to the VIP lounge.</p><p>Fragrant tea and fruits were then served by the waiters. As the attendants left, Tang Xiu, who came in at this moment, wore a smiling face. Behind him were the excited-looking Yuan Chuling, Yue Kai, Hu Qingsong, and followed by Cheng Yannan, who just wanted to watch the lively and fun event.</p><p>“Please do excuse me for not going out to greet you, Senior Duanmu.”</p><p>With a smile on his face, Tang Xiu came to Duanmu Lin, who stood up from the sofa and smilingly shook hands with him. The senior officers from the Special Abilities Bureau then followed suit.</p><p>Duanmu Lin glanced around at Yuan Chuling’s group of four behind Tang Xiu. Then, he smiled and asked, “Care to tell me who they are, Tang Xiu?”</p><p>“They are all here to join in the fun, Senior Duanmu,” said Tang Xiu smilingly. “But you don’t need to pay attention to them, though. The sole reason I brought them here is to show them what a big business really is.”</p><p>A look of surprise was cast on Duanmu Lin’s face. He knew Tang Xiu quite well. This young man had always deep purposes in doing things. With him bringing these young people together was definitely not only to let them see a big business being conducted. However, he wouldn’t drive these few people out since Tang Xiu was the one who spoke. As everyone present had taken a seat one after another, he asked with a smile, “You’ve researched and developed that Avion, would you please let me see it before we get down to business?”</p><p>Tang Xiu clapped and smilingly cried out, “Come in!”</p><p>Immediately, Kang Xia, who had been waiting outside the door, came into the hall with a black suitcase. She arrived at Jingmen Island early in the morning and brought the developed Flying Disc herself.</p><p>“Please take out the Avion and show it to Senior Duanmu, Kang Xia,” said Tang Xiu with a smile.</p><p>Kang Xia let out a faint smile and put the black suitcase on the coffee table in front of Duanmu Lin and the several seniors of the Special Abilities Bureau. After two unlocking procedures, she opened the black suitcase and took out a flat round disc from the inside with two footprint markers on its surface.</p><p>“Senior Duanmu, let me present to you the high-tech product developed by our Magnificent Tang Corporation. We originally coined it ‘Flying Disc’, but Tang Xiu felt it was a rather unsophisticated name. Hence, it was then we directly christened it as Hectometer Aeroglider,” explained Kang Xia with a smile.</p><p>Duanmu Lin took out the Avion out of the black suitcase and carefully observed it in his hands. The senior officers of the Special Abilities Bureau also came together, wanting to study the features and extraordinariness of this object. Unfortunately, these few people couldn’t find its working mechanism and uniqueness after spending ten minutes.</p><p>“Director Kang, can you give us a detailed introduction of its features? It’d be best to show us a demonstration if possible,” said Duanmu Lin.</p><p>“Alright. I’ll do the introduction presentation of this object,” said Kang Xia with a faint smile. “However, we need to go outside for the demonstration since it would attract a lot of guests. I don’t think Senior Duanmu wishes the news of this Hectometer Aeroglider to be spread out so easily, no?”</p><p>“True that! We must pay attention to confidentiality.” Duanmu Lin approved hurriedly.</p><p>Kang Xia smilingly continued her presentation. “Let us continue, then. This Hectometer Aeroglider is a high-tech product developed by many scientists in collaboration with Fengshui experts and even some people from the Occult Sect employed by our Magnificent Tang Corporation. Shortly put, we’ve invested a lot of human and material resources in order to research and develop this product. Its circular shape resembles the shield used by Captain America, but there are two concaved beddings on its surface which are designed and made according to the size of human feet, or the user’s feet who stand on them. You can see the switch in my hand which has two buttons and functions as start and stop buttons.</p><p>“When the user stands on this Hectometer Aeroglider, two clippers will be activated on both footprints—shaped concaved beddings, which will firmly secure the user’s footing so as to ensure his or her safety. Additionally, this object heavily adopts the mechanism of spatial theory, especially for its anti-gravity system. It’s also equipped with responsive sensor instruments, as well as some array patterns laid out by cultivators who have the expertise in this field. With each function coordinating with one another, the user will be able to stand firmly on it, giving him the capability to fly and hover in the air.</p><p>“This Hectometer Aeroglider also has sensors that can detect the surrounding environments. It works like ultrasonic waves unique to bats. Should it face any obstruction, it will automatically plan the trajectory and route to ensure the safety of the user even without any interaction from the user.</p><p>“To power this Aeroglider, there are energy batteries we’ve particularly developed for this product. Each energy battery ensures that this Aeroglider can fly for approximately 100km. But after the internal source of power runs out, the batteries need to be replaced for continuous use. The Magnificent Tang Corporation will also provide two free energy batteries for the customers who buy this Hectometer Aeroglider.</p><p>“Aside from its flight capability, it also has another special function which can make it to surf on the water surface. When the user stands on it, he or she can control the Hectometer Aeroglider to surf fast on the water surface smoothly. Using it in this mode can also reduce its power consumption considerably.”</p><p>As Kang Xia spoke up to this point, she turned to glance at Tang Xiu. She could see a smile on his face which expressed his satisfaction toward her presentation. It made her immediately feel elated and warm inside. She then continued speaking to Duanmu Lin and the several senior officers from the Special Abilities Bureau. “The price we set for each Hectometer Aeroglider is 2 million yuan, and 200 yuan for each battery. We’re using our latest hybrid high-tech materials in manufacturing this Hectometer Aeroglider, which is extremely sturdy and has a hardness scale nearly comparable to diamonds. Hence, you can expect it to have a very long life in service. We can guarantee for it to work flawlessly for 200,000km use without any failures on the premise that the damage is not done on purpose or intentional.”</p><p>Duanmu Lin and the top senior officers of the Special Abilities Bureau were all shocked. Kang Xia’s presentation made them deeply aware that the technology used on this Hectometer Aeroglider was far sophisticated and superior to the world’s top technology nowadays. If its function really worked as Kang Xia said, this object would really be a very outstanding high-tech product. It could even be said as a milestone in the history of mankind towards a more advanced level of science and technology.</p><p>These several people were crystal clear that once this Hectometer Aeroglider was adopted by the military, it would undoubtedly become excellent combat equipment for soldiers and military operatives. It was even hopeful for every soldier to perform superhuman actions. They had even begun to imagine that once this Aeroglider entered the army, tens of thousands… hundreds of thousands, or even millions of soldiers equipped by this gadget would form a one-of-a-kind flying formation in the sky.</p><p>Furthermore, if this kind of aircraft was to be popularized to the public, it was very likely that it would immediately win the popularity among people all over the world. Even its appearance could replace those luxurious cars, planes, and ships while paving its way to becoming the most advanced means of transportation in the world.</p><p>“What about its speed? How fast is it?”</p><p>Duanmu Lin trained his eyes on Kang Xia firmly, anticipation evident on his face.</p><p>“It has a top speed of 100km/h. However, let us make it clear, Senior Duanmu. We actually have the ability to increase its speed so it can move much faster. However, some problems will definitely arise if we design to have much faster speed, such as an enormous consumption of power which the energy battery won’t be able to keep up.”</p><p>Duanmu Lin’s breathing turned fast upon hearing that its top speed could reach 100km/h. It simply had greatly exceeded his expectations. Yet, it would’ve been much better if this Aeroglider could be made much faster.</p><p>“Director Kang, there’s another issue I’d like to know as well. How long it will take your Magnificent Tang Corporation to start producing the upgraded version after launching this Aeroglider? I’m sure you should have a vision for the upgraded version already. What I want to know is the feature and the effect of this upgraded version,” said Duanmu Lin quickly.</p><p>Instead of answering the question, Kang Xia turned to look at Tang Xiu with hesitation on her face. This inquiry related to some secrets of the technology possessed by the company, and she absolutely didn’t want to disclose it to anyone without Tang Xiu’s permission.</p><p>“Senior Duanmu, Kang Xia has reported this issue to me as well. But I can disclose it to you if you really want to know about it,” said Tang Xiu with a light smile. “It will take us half a year at the most to double the Hectometer Aeroglider’s speed, and each energy battery can also last for 200km.”</p><p>‘200km/h speed?!!’</p><p>Duanmu Lin’s breathing rate turned faster yet again and his eyes turned extraordinarily bright. Half a minute later, he slowly said, “I only have three more issues I’d like to ask. If two of them can satisfy me, I’ll order a large number of Hectometer Aerogliders.”</p><p>“Let me ask you something first, Senior Duanmu,” replied Tang Xiu with a smile. “Do you really have the plenary power to make a business deal with me on behalf of the military?”</p><p>“I do,” answered Duanmu Lin in a deep voice.</p><p>Tang Xiu’s eyes instantly lit up. He then nodded and said, “If so, then please ask us about those three issues, Senior Duanmu! I believe we can give you a satisfactory answer.”</p><p>“How high is the altitude that can be reached by the Hectometer Aeroglider?” asked Duanmu Lin.</p><p>“The highest it can reach is about 200 meters,” answered Tang Xiu.</p><p>“That’s an acceptable height,” Duanmu Lin said with satisfaction. “Now, about the second issue—the wind will undoubtedly produce some effects at a high altitude. You should’ve known that the user will be directly exposed to the wind, and it will have a serious impact on the users that they can’t even open their eyes, right? I want to know how you solved this problem.”</p><p>Tang Xiu smiled and made a gesture to Kang Xia, instructing her to explain it.</p><p>Kang Xia smiled and said, “When the users fly this Hectometer Aeroglider, a transparent energy shield will be activated. It has a powerful aerodynamic effect to alleviate the obstruction from the wind and even plays a role to protect the user’s body. Even if there’s any object collision at high altitude, like, say… birds, the users will absolutely not be injured, unless someone shoots them with a gun.”</p><p>“Energy shield, you say?”</p><p>Duanmu Lin abruptly got up and looked horrified. He never thought that Kang Xia would provide him with such an answer.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
