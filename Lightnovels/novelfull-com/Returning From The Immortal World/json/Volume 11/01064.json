Destroying a horde of thousands of demonic beasts at once was nothing but a foolish dream. However, he was confident that his action had caused confusion for this horde and destroyed their purpose to attack the defensive line.</p><p>And so, he fled with a lightning bolt speed.</p><p>The thousands of demonic beasts frantically chased after him, charging and galloping like mighty troops of warhorses. The demonic beasts’ commander, who had the strength of least at a late-stage of Golden Core cultivator, had been badly wounded by Tang Xiu. And thus, it now furiously directed the horde to chase after the culprit, Tang Xiu.</p><p>At this moment, Tang Xiu had deactivated his Invisibility Charm. It was in his plan to expose himself so as to attract these demonic beasts to other places.</p><p>****</p><p>Ugley Town.</p><p>Inside the olive-green military tent that served as the temporary headquarters, dozens of LCD monitors were neatly arranged and displayed the surveillance footage of important areas in the Himalayas.</p><p>Duanmu Lin and several high-level experts from Special Abilities Bureau all wore worried faces and occasionally pointed at the 3D sand table to discuss troops and manpower deployment for the defense line.</p><p>“We have a situation, Chief!”</p><p>The face of a member of the Special Abilities Bureau who sat in the corner suddenly changed. He turned his head and called out behind Duanmu Lin.</p><p>Upon hearing his call, Duanmu Mulin strode to the surveillance footage screen in the corner along with several experts from the agency. When their eyes landed on the monitor, a look of disbelief overflowing from their eyes.</p><p>“How is that possible?!” Despite his firm mind, Duanmu Lin still exclaimed in alarm.</p><p>The member of the Special Abilities Bureau sitting there said, “The footage shown on the screen was normal a moment ago. The forming demonic beast horde kept increasing but was still orderly then. But lightning bolts flashed down all of a sudden out of the blue and severely injured many bird-species demonic beasts. Shortly after that, flames blazed in the midst of the horde, directly burning several demonic beasts closest to the source to death, and burned hundreds more.”</p><p>“Was it Tang Xiu?” asked Duanmu Lin.</p><p>That member of the agency repeatedly nodded, and there was admiration on his face. “That’s correct, Chief. It was Tang Xiu. Although his figure didn’t appear on the screen, he seemed to be in an invisible state or something. However, his long sword suddenly appeared and produced a sword light nearly 100 meters long that crushed down the horde. Many demonic beasts that were directly hit by it met their sudden death, and a lot more panicked and frantically fled towards the surroundings. I saw with my own eyes when that small demonic beast then suddenly bubbled up in size and was nearly insta-killed by that sword. It’s very likely… the main target of that sword was that particular demonic beast.”</p><p>With eyes fixated on the surveillance screen, Duanmu Lin asked again in a deep voice, “And then?”</p><p>The agency member answered, “Shortly after, Tang Xiu’s figure appeared out of thin air. He seemed to have succeeded in enraging all the demonic beasts, which is the scene you’re seeing now. These thousand demonic beasts are chasing him. Ah… that’s bad… there are no monitoring devices installed in front! We won’t get any footage on the screen soon.”</p><p>As his voice faded away, the footage where Tang Xiu was being chased by thousands of demonic beasts disappeared. Obviously, it was out of the scope of the surveillance camera.</p><p>A scowl appeared on Duanmu Lin’s face and he roared, “Dammit! He’s so reckless! He’s not that powerful, and attacking such a horde alone is out of his league! This is… simply courting his own death.”</p><p>Aquababe, however, replied in a low voice with a worried face, “Chief, should we send some people to fetch him up? Getting chased by thousands of demonic beasts is too dangerous.”</p><p>“Help him? How should we do that, dammit?! Do you wanna die or something?” Duanmu Lin angrily retorted. “Those are thousands of demonic beasts, for God’s sake! All of them are horrible, and even if we drag everyone there, there’s no way it’s enough to kill them!”</p><p>Suddenly, the eyes of a middle-aged man standing next to Duanmu Lin lit up and he slowly said, “I don’t think so, Director Duanmu. I think Tang Xiu must have a reason for acting like that.”</p><p>“You don’t know Tang Xiu, Tian He.” Duanmu turned to him and said, “This guy has always been daring. But he… what intention does he have in mind?”</p><p>“Director Duanmu, don’t tell me you haven’t figured it out yet.” Tian He shook his head and said, “If you create confusion in the demonic beasts’ horde and lead them to other places, doesn’t it mean that our defensive line is saved? I’ve never met Tang Xiu indeed, but I’ve studied some things about him. He has a steady and firm mind, is quick-witted, and his actions are the embodiment of steadiness. I don’t think he’d do something he has no assurance of succeeding.”</p><p>Duanmu Lin was stunned. He was vaguely aware that Tian He’s argument was sound. After giving it a careful contemplation, he took a long sigh, shook his head and said with a forced a smile, “Having a concern with a chaotic mind… you’re right. I’m too worried about this boy’s safety, so I missed this point. You’re correct. Tang Xiu has always been steady and systematic in doing things. He indeed won’t do something he has no assurance of.”</p><p>Having said that, respect appeared on his face. He now understood Tang Xiu’s painstaking efforts and really admired them. If he were in his shoes and twice as powerful as he was, he still wouldn’t dare to do so, since he would likely meet his demise once a mishap occurred.</p><p>Duanmu Lin took a deep breath and issued an order in a deep voice, “Keep monitoring the situation and report everything that happens.”</p><p>****</p><p>Deep in the mountain range.</p><p>Tang Xiu rushed as fast as he could and didn’t fly. His feet stepped on the snowy mountain and moved lightning-fast. The speed of the demonic beasts chasing after him was by no means slow either, and the distance between him and dozens of powerful ones was getting closer and closer.</p><p>I gotta find a way to obstruct them. I’ve used up the array disks, and it’s impossible to lay out an array instantly. It would be difficult to arrange a powerful array before they catch up if I can’t find the time.</p><p>While running, his mind revolved fast. Suddenly, his face slightly shifted as an idea popped up in his mind. His figure then streaked up into the sky as he instantly unleashed the divine sword once again and controlled it to dash toward a big mountain in front. As he flew halfway up the mountaintop, he slashed the sword toward the massive body.</p><p>BOOM…</p><p>Rocks were blasted out, directly causing an avalanche.</p><p>Behind him, thousands of demonic beasts looked furious at the same time, since they never imagined that this abominable human was so sinister and stopped by to cause an avalanche just to obstruct their pursuit. Only the hundreds of flying-species demonic beasts in the sky hadn’t been affected and kept flapping their wings after him.</p><p>The next one is that mountain valley.</p><p>A resolute look was cast on Tang Xiu’s face. He quickly looked back and glanced at the sky behind him. He saw hundreds of flying-species demonic beasts and could feel the aura they emitted out. The group had two at Golden Core Stage while the rest were at the Foundation Establishment Stage.</p><p>“Sect Master.”</p><p>In the distance, Mo Awu led two experts of the Tang Sect and dashed faster toward Tang Xiu. They could clearly see the flying-species demonic beasts from afar and knew that they found Tang Xiu’s trail since those beasts were chasing him.</p><p>Tang Xiu’s complexion changed and looked restless, for he never thought to meet Mo Awu’s group here.</p><p>Huh? Where are the rest? Mo Awu’s group has tens of disciples, how can there be only three of them? Where are the rest of them?</p><p>“It’s dangerous. Get here quickly!”</p><p>Tang Xiu’s figure rose to the sky. A tens of meters long sword light burst out from his sword and fiercely slashed toward the overwhelming horde of demonic beasts. Overlapping layers of sword light instantly turned into waves of the sea of swords, attempting to steamroll several hundred demonic beasts.</p><p>Mo Awu’s group of three bolted forward extremely fast and traversed less than 800 meters in just a few seconds. When they appeared mid-air, Tang Xiu was brandishing his sword and caused the flock of bird-species demonic beasts to become a mess, even killing tens of them directly.</p><p>“How can there only be three of you, Awu? Where are the rest in your team?” asked Tang Xiu loudly without looking back.</p><p>“They’ve left the mountain range and are now recuperating, Sect Master,” replied Mo Awu in a deep voice. “But one of my team has died in battle, and most of them are seriously injured.”</p><p>At his report, Tang Xiu was a bit relieved. Then, he replied in a deep voice, “We have at least thousands of demonic beasts at the back of this mountain peak. Go ahead and wait in that valley in front. I’ll catch up with you immediately after I lay out the geomancy array in front of that valley.”</p><p>“But Hao Lei took her team behind that valley, Sect Master,” said Mo Awu hastily. “They are in a dire situation, with some seriously injured and without combat ability. More than a dozen more are also seriously injured and won’t be able to fight well even if they join the battle. If you were to lure this horde of demonic beasts there, it will be equivalent to sending them to their deaths!”</p><p>“Say what?!” Tang Xiu was shocked. He gritted his teeth and said, “We don’t have any other option! You go there to aid them to prepare for battle while that horde has yet to catch up. In one minute, I’ll catch up with you all and I need you to resist those bird-species demonic beasts while I seize the time to arrange the array!”</p><p>“Understood!” replied Mo Awu without thinking.</p><p>Immediately after, he and the other two dashed towards the valley behind. While Tang Xiu was strenuously obstructing hundreds of bird-species demonic beasts and killing one after another, they finally disappeared into the remote valley.</p><p>On the sparkling surface of a lake, more than ten demonic beasts were besieging Hao Lei and tens of Tang Sect disciples. As of now, nearly half of them had been seriously injured and only about 20 still had the ability to fight. Furthermore, these tens of demonic beasts were very powerful, with one at the Golden Core Stage.</p><p>“KEEP FIGHTING! We’ll be able to get a chance to breathe as long as we kill these demonic beasts. Mo Awu’s group just appeared nearby, but that they haven’t come here only means that there are also some other disciples of our sect nearby!” Hao Lei shouted. Her complexion was pale, and there was a bleeding scar on her forehead, causing the blood to flow down and paint her gorgeous face red. Yet, it also added a valiant and savage aura to her.</p><p>“KILL!!!”</p><p>The rest of the Tang Sect disciples who suffered minor injuries increased their offensive and struck with renewed power all of a sudden.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
