He had obtained an inheritance and gained enormous knowledge as a result. To think that his Master was once at the Supremacy Stage in the Immortal World, yet he was still ambushed by the enemy. Although he didn’t know how his Master survived, he could tell how catastrophic it was like to think that he ended up at the bottom.</p><p>All in all, it meant one thing—his Master’s enemies were all very powerful. At least people who he couldn’t afford to fight against. And thus, it was critical to block all the news about this matter.</p><p>“Don’t worry, Master! I’ll never tell a soul. Not even my family,” said Chen Zhizhong.</p><p>“Just remember it well.” Tang Xiu nodded and said, “Anyways, let’s not waste time here. I’ve already figured out most of this array’s features. I should be able to crack it two days later and we should be able to leave directly then. You can consolidate your current cultivation while I analyze this array.”</p><p>“Understood!”</p><p>After saluting, Chen Zhizhong turned around and walked to a bluestone nearby, sitting cross-legged and steadily stabilizing his present cultivation level.</p><p>Unwilling to waste more time, Tang Xiu fully set his mind on cracking the array. He still needed to spend some efforts to crack the array laid out by the Diablo Praecantator Clan since he only had bits of knowledge about their arrays, whereas the arrays arranged by the Sacred Pristine Palace had similar principles to the ones he had comprehended. Unfortunately, his cultivation was still too low despite how great the efforts he spent. Otherwise, he’d have been able to comprehend the array in front of him in a flash and easily break it with a flick of his finger.</p><p>Two days passed by quickly. When Tang Xiu had taken control of the entire small world formation, he had comprehended all the abstruseness of this array. The arrays here were all connected and subtly interlinked. Fortunately for him, he had directly analyzed the entire small world array and comprehended it now. If he were to directly analyze it, it was very likely that he couldn’t fully understand it. The design of this array formation and several novels outlining methods about it still gave some benefits to Tang Xiu.</p><p>“Break…”</p><p>Along with a small movement of Tang Xiu’s finger, the layers of transparent energy shield that covered the valley suddenly rippled and an opening suddenly appeared in a flash.</p><p>“Master!”</p><p>At the moment Tang Xiu broke the array, Chen Zhizhong had already woken up from his cultivation. As the opening was getting bigger, he bolted lightning-fast towards Tang Xiu. Due to the sudden increase in his cultivation, however, he was still unable to control his power and he would’ve hit Tang Xiu’s arm if it wasn’t for Tang Xiu moving aside to avoid it.</p><p>Tang Xiu laughed at him and then said, “Well, it will take some time for you to fully stabilize your cultivation level and control your current power. I think you need to hand over your business to your son after we get back! Even if he doesn’t want to do so, tell him to return to Star City to take it over. You’re to go to our sect’s domain and cultivate in seclusion. Your cultivation will yield double the results if you practice there.”</p><p>“And where’s our sect’s land, Master?” asked Chen Zhizhong quickly.</p><p>“Nine Dragons Island,” said Tang Xiu with a smile.</p><p>Chen Zhizhong understood quickly. He knew the backstage story back when Tang Xiu purchased Nine Dragons Island. Tang Xiu didn’t have enough money then, so he provided most of the funds for him. In addition, he also knew that Tang Xiu carried out a reconstruction project there, although he didn’t expect that his Master would establish the Tang Sect and chose that island as the sect’s holy ground.</p><p>“I’ll arrange it right away once I go back, Master.”</p><p>Tang Xiu nodded in response and his body flashed towards the array. Under Chen Zhizhong’s puzzled eyes, his figure kept flashing and a small twister was formed while pieces of artifacts kept falling into Tang Xiu’s hands and were stored into his interspatial ring.</p><p>After a long while, Tang Xiu came out from the formation and threw the war blade to Chen Zhizhong, smilingly saying, “This war blade belonged to Discalceate Diabolos. He was once a famous and prominent figure in command of countless Diablo Praecantator Clan’s experts. This war blade of his is also a fine immortal weapon. You must refine this war blade and use it as your weapon before you advance into the Immortal Stage. When you’re powerful enough and have refined this war blade in the future, you’ll have a genuine immortal weapon for yourself.”</p><p>“Understood!” replied Chen Zhizhong happily.</p><p>Although the Diablo Praecantator Clan left behind a large number of objects and all of them were taken away by Tang Xiu, he was perfectly aware that he was the person who benefitted the most. Just the inheritance of this clan and the transformation of his physique was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for him.</p><p>As for the weapons, they were nothing but external objects.</p><p>However, he didn’t know that all the weapons and interspatial rings left behind by the Diablo Praecantator Clan Tang Xiu had just taken away contained many treasures even in the Immortal World. He had no idea how valuable these objects were.</p><p>It must be noted that the number of Diablo Praecantator clansmen who left their interspatial rings and weapons behind was not just in the hundreds, but more than 12 million. Tang Xiu’s technique to gather all of them was so fast and yet he still needed a long time to collect all of them. Fortunately, he directly refined these Praecantators’ interspatial rings—otherwise, he wouldn’t have been able to store so many objects.</p><p>Chen Zhizhong had never been to the Immortal World and his knowledge about immortal weapons was very limited. Otherwise, he would’ve realized that the value of these immortal tools and weapons taken away by Tang Xiu was enough for him to buy a vast area of a starfield in the Immortal World while recruiting millions of immortals to work for him.</p><p>“Alright, let’s head out!”</p><p>Tang Xiu glanced at the fingers on his left hand happily and smilingly said.</p><p>“Ehh?” Chen Zhizhong hurriedly said, “But we haven’t explored this small world yet, Master! If there’s a lot of ores here, we must bring them out, no?”</p><p>“I already have this small world under my control, so I can easily sense everything here through the array.” Tang Xiu lightly smiled and said, “This place is actually a prison. There are no other precious ores except those 36 Celestial Stones. I’ll take them away directly when we leave this place and this small world will cease to exist.”</p><p>Chen Zhizhong quickly understood and said with a smile, “I’d like to learn array formations from you later, Master.”</p><p>“Huh? Don’t tell me you have no knowledge about arrays in the inheritance you obtained from the hundreds of Diablo Praecantator experts?” asked Tang Xiu.</p><p>“I did obtain it, but they are all wizardry arrays. And they are not that powerful either.” Chen Zhizhong forced a smile and said, “Their arrays pale in comparison to the really powerful ones in the Immortal World, Master.”</p><p>“Haha.” Tang Xiu chuckled and said, “That’s true. The Diablo Praecantator Clan boasted formidable individual power. What they pursued were individual might and the quality of their weapons and regarded geomancy array as auxiliary and rather neglected it. Alright then, since you want to learn it, I’ll teach you later. Ah, I forgot something. Try to unleash your strongest strike. Let me see what stage you’ve reached now.”</p><p>Chen Zhizhong accepted the order and flashed away to the distance. A kilometer away, he unleashed a powerful punch at the hilltop in front of him.</p><p>One strike! Yet, the tens-of-meters high hilltop was directly blasted. The might of the punch was comparable to a strike by a Nascent Soul Stage expert. In the next moment, he brandished the war blade and hacked it towards the big mountain. The powerful bombardment created a huge hole a dozen meters wide and a hundred meters deep on the massif.</p><p>“How do you see my current power, Master?” asked Chen Zhizhong hurriedly as he returned to Tang Xiu’s front with an excited face.</p><p>“Not bad.” Tang Xiu nodded and said, “Your power is enough to match experts at the late-stage of Nascent Soul. I can’t compare to you in terms of cultivation level, but the likelihood of you being killed by me is high if we fight. There are several reasons for this. Firstly, you’re still unable to fully control your power. Secondly, you’re lacking in combat experience; especially between experts. Thirdly, even experts at Nascent Soul Stage will find it hard to win me.”</p><p>Deep worship filled Chen Zhizhong’s eyes as he replied, “Well, your power is kinda progressing too fast, Master. I still remember when we first met. Your strength was probably far weaker before I got the inheritance. But it only took you a year and a half and you’re already able to defeat the Nascent Soul Stage experts. That’s way too amazing. I think you’ll be able to cross the tribulation and ascend to become an Immortal in a few years, no?”</p><p>“Hahaha.” Tang Xiu couldn’t help but burst into laughter. “How can it be so easy to cross a tribulation and become an Immortal? It’s just a matter of course for one to progress very fast at an early stage of their cultivation. But it will be more difficult to advance in cultivation in the future as it will take more time to break through each layer. My luck is quite good and I got many fortuitous encounters, that’s the reason why I can contend with experts at the Nascent Soul Stage in just one and a half years. But it’s hard to say in the future!”</p><p>Chen Zhizhong was stunned and suddenly realized that he didn’t know much about the cultivation path. The inheritance he obtained from the Diablo Praecantator Clan was limited to the circumstances faced by this clan as well as their cultivation—far from being enough to grasp even the common and superficial knowledge in the Immortal World.</p><p>However, his worship towards Tang Xiu didn’t diminish even if the latter admitted such. After all, he knew how mighty powerful those at the Supremacy Stage in the Immortal World were. Not even in the heyday of the Diablo Praecantator Clan had any of its members broken through to the Supremacy Stage. Even all the previous sages and kings of this clan were only at the Perfected Golden Immortal Stage.</p><p>Quickly after, Tang Xiu and Chen Zhizhong appeared at the exit passage to the grotto. They looked back at the small world in front of them. Without flinching, Tang Xiu then told Chen Zhizhong to wait outside as he immediately cast a technique to break the whole array.</p><p>“Come to me, Celestial Stones!”</p><p>As his shout rolled forward, 36 Celestial Stones flew to him and he directly stored them in his interspatial ring. These Celestial Stones only had small uses for him, but they were the best treasures for Gu Yan’er and Ji Chimei. With them now living on Earth and Earth itself not having immortal energy, the rate of restoring their power and healing was very slow.</p><p>A tremor shook the earth and the mountains swayed.</p><p>Tang Xiu watched as the small world in front of him gradually became illusory. He no longer stayed there and his figure was as though turned into lightning as he bolted outside through the passage in the grotto.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>After he appeared outside the cave in just less than a minute, the entire mountain peak then collapsed along with the destruction of the small world.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
