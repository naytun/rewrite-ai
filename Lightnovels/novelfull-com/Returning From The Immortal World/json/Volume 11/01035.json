The sight in front of him was far beyond his imagination. The moment he could stabilize his footing, he frantically dashed backward instantly for tens of meters. Only after he reached another high boulder several meters back did he finally stop, gasping and panting.</p><p>Headless humans; armless humans; legless humans…</p><p>Some of them had even ten centimeters wide holes in their chests…</p><p>If these humans were just corpses, Chen Zhizhong wouldn’t be that frightened, but he couldn’t help but panic seeing that these people were absolutely not dead… All of them were still alive!</p><p>That’s right, they were all alive.</p><p>It was very hard for him to imagine what kind of lifeform could still survive without a head?! It was beyond his cognition that these monster-like humans looked extremely wretched and miserable. Yet, how come they still had still signs of life?!</p><p>“Hehe… this is so fun and interesting. To think that some living creatures appeared here. How many years has it been? A thousand? Or is it ten thousand years? I finally see some foreign lifeforms… It’s a human! Hehehe…” Among the hundreds of incomplete humans was a man who lost his arms and had a bloody wound on his chest. He mechanically raised his head as his eyes looked at the direction of Chen Zhizhong’s hiding place.</p><p>“It’s very interesting to have a living human coming here. Is he also a dissident who has been exiled to this godforsaken place? But why didn’t he get a corporeal punishment? Did he bribe the criminal officer? Is it because of his background?”</p><p>“Whatever his background or origins, for him to come here intact means that he’s not a friend but an enemy! Treat him as an enemy and kill him!”</p><p>“Hehe… let’s play with him and try his strength first, guys. It won’t be too late to kill him after we ruin him, no?”</p><p>“Who’s going first?”</p><p>“My turn!”</p><p>“Me!”</p><p>“…”</p><p>Dumbfounded and tongue-tied, Chen Zhizhong looked at these people… No… they should be monsters! If he was given another chance, he would never want to come here and be stared at by this group of monsters.</p><p>With his hiding spot already discovered, Chen Zhizhong no longer hid. He moved to the side of the boulder and shouted, “Who are you, people?”</p><p>A legless man around 40 looking like a bearded middle-aged man looked particularly aggressive and ferocious. Floating like a ghost, he stopped ten meters away from Chen Zhizhong and laughed wildly. “Hahaha, you really don’t know who we are? When the heck did the Sacred Pristine Palace become so interesting to imprison such a dumb brat like you here?”</p><p>“What Sacred Pristine Palace?” Chen Zhizhong frowned and said, “I don’t get what you mean. Nobody took me here. I came here with my Master.”</p><p>“Your Master?” The legless man blinked and suddenly burst into laughter. “Hahaha, he’s not some fucking dissident who got banished here, but just followed his Master into this prison? That’s so damn absurd and ridiculous! Is there anyone who would come into this prison willingly? Am I getting it wrong, or are you fucking shitting me?”</p><p>Pacing backward several steps, Chen Zhizhong vigilantly asked, “Who are you really?”</p><p>The legless man’s face changed and his aura fiercely burst out instantly just like a gale that blasted forward, instantly pressuring Chen Zhizhong. However, at the same time his blasting aura rolled four-plus meters forward, it was blocked by a transparent shield as two black chains appeared out of thin air, binding his neck and waist.</p><p>“Goddammit!”</p><p>The legless man looked furious, raving and roaring a few times before taking back his bursting aura. However, with his eyes staring fixedly at Chen Zhizhong, he said in a deep voice, “We’re all the most formidable warriors of Diablo Praecantator Clan. Those abominable robbers from Sacred Pristine Palace expanded their territory by using our clan. We killed and plundered for your campaigns. After they made us the scapegoat to the entire cultivation world, you all actually betrayed us, killed our king, massacred our people, and imprisoned all our loyal disciples who had paid so much. You’re all so fucking wretched! Damnable abominations!”</p><p>Diablo Praecantator Clan? Sacred Pristine Palace?</p><p>No tail, head, nor anything came to Chen Zhizhong’s mind. He was utterly confused. He was not a cultivator before and knew very little about the happenings in the cultivation world. However, he was sure of something at this moment. The fact that these people’s ability to move and act was limited and subject to restrictions. They seemed to be unable to come out of the energy shield, nor were they able to free themselves from those black chains. Hence, they posed no threat to him.</p><p>“Gotta leave this place fast!”</p><p>Chen Zhizhong thought for a moment before turning around and frantically dashing the way he came from. Running as fast as he could, he shuttled back through the forested mountains and appeared before Tang Xiu 20 minutes after.</p><p>“Master.”</p><p>Tang Xiu opened his eyes and asked in surprise, “Weren’t you searching around? Why did you come back so soon?”</p><p>Chen Zhizhong gulped and hurriedly said, “I found some monsters in the valley tens of kilometers away, Master. They said that they’re from Diablo Praecantator Clan and things like Sacred Pristine Palace I know nothing about. I didn’t get anything they said, so I hurriedly returned. Ah, that’s right. I also saw something. These monsters are all prisoners here. They are imprisoned.”</p><p>Diablo Praecantator Clan and Sacred Pristine Palace?</p><p>Disbelief and incredulity were obvious on Tang Xiu’s face. He had heard of these two names; not on Earth but in the Immortal World!</p><p>It was recorded in the Immortal World that the Diablo Praecantator Clan and the Sacred Pristine Palace had once existed. But according to that ancient records, they were around more than 100,000 years ago.</p><p>“Take me there,” said Tang Xiu with a deep voice after he immediately got up.</p><p>Quickly after, Tang Xiu arrived at the valley and was quite shocked when he saw several hundred monsters there. Even in his dream, he never expected that there would be the Diablo Praecantator Clan on Earth. It must be noted that this clan was said to have been exterminated by the Sacred Pristine Palace 100,000 years ago in the Immortal World. Putting it bluntly, it was a true genocide. The incident led to the changes of the Sacred Pristine Palace that eventually led to its demise, destroyed by its former arch-enemies.</p><p>“Another human?”</p><p>The headless man fluttered and appeared behind the transparent energy shield as his voice came out of thin air. He pointed to Tang Xiu and his voice was heard again, “Are you the Master of this insect? Are you here by yourself? Those bastards from the Sacred Pristine Palace didn’t imprison you?”</p><p>Tang Xiu observed these people before his eyes finally landed on the headless man again. Then, he said with an indifferent face, “My disciple said that you’re Diablo Praecantator clansmen. Is this true?”</p><p>“That’s right.” The headless man’s voice got louder and seething killing intent could be sensed in his voice.</p><p>The legless man stared at Tang Xiu and fiercely asked, “Who are you? How did you get into this prison world?”</p><p>“May I know your honorable name?” asked Tang Xiu.</p><p>“This Lord is the general of the Diablo Praecantator Clan, Garza Dracomando—known to my enemies as the Discalceate Diabolos,” answered the legless man. “You haven’t answered our question, Brat!”</p><p>“Garza Dracomando, as in the Discalceate Diabolos of Diablo Praecantator Clan?!” exclaimed Tang Xiu incredulously. “Weren’t you one of the 18 generals under the King of Diablo Praecantator Clan, the Discalceate Diabolos who laid waste to 36 Immortal Kingdoms and massacred their armies of 100 million strong?”</p><p>“You know this seat? Who are you?” asked the legless man in surprise.</p><p>Tang Xiu cupped his fists and introduced himself. “My name is Tang Xiu, a junior of the Vermillion Bird Holy Sect from 100,000 years after your Diablo Praecantator Clan was destroyed. My Vermillion Bird Holy Sect has been in existence in the Immortal World for one million years, so you must have heard of it.”</p><p>The faces of several hundreds of Diablo Praecantator clansmen drastically changed at that instant. Due to the fearsome reputation and prestige of the Vermillion Bird Holy Sect, this sect was not a strange name to them, although their immortal kingdom in the Immortal World was far away from the Vermillion Bird Holy Sect’s territory.</p><p>“Tang Xiu? You have a peculiar aura and your soul is very strange. Have you ever died and your soul occupied someone’s mortal coil?” asked the legless man after observing Tang Xiu.</p><p>Tang Xiu raised his eyes and nodded. “Yes, I have.”</p><p>“Then how did you come here? This is the prison world created by the Sacred Pristine Palace to imprison us,” asked Discalceate Diabolos. “No one except those from the Sacred Pristine Palace can enter this place.”</p><p>“This world is not the Immortal World, but on another plane.” Tang Xiu shook his head and said, “Although I have no idea how this prison world connects to Earth, the Sacred Pristine Palace you just mentioned has long been destroyed more than 100,000 years ago, while the remaining disciples of this sect were all massacred by the ancient Gorefiend Diabolos.”</p><p>“That Gorefiend geezer?”</p><p>“Hahaha, so it turned out to be Gorefiend Diabolos!”</p><p>“It’s retribution! It’s all fated punishment! How could the Sacred Pristine Palace fend off the revenge of their powerful enemies without us, Diablo Praecantator Clan? Gorefiend Diabolos, huh… Hahaha… This seat once massacred hundreds of thousands of clans and tribes with him in the past. I didn’t expect him to come back from the Immortal Sea of Evil!”</p><p>“So they’ve died, huh? But goddammit. Pity this seat can’t escape this place, or I could’ve them beheaded, ripped out their hearts and scattered their souls by my own hands.”</p><p>“It’s really unexpected that it was the enemy who gave us our revenge…”</p><p>“…”</p><p>Hundreds of Diablo Praecantator clansmen fell into ecstasy. But suddenly, they all fell into silence as all of them shut their eyes and lain down on the ground, followed by bizarre notes that came out from them as though they were chanting and holding memorial services.</p><p>Tang Xiu calmly observed them until all of them stood up again. Then, he slowly asked, “I don’t know what happened between you and the Sacred Pristine Palace. I just want to know something. You now learned that your archnemesis has already been destroyed. So, do you have any plans for the future?”</p><p>“Plan?”</p><p>The hundreds of Diablo Praecantator clansmen were all bewildered and at a loss. The drive that motivated them to survive was to kill off the Sacred Palace’s enemies first. Having been betrayed by the Sacred Pristine Palace and now that all their enemies were now gone, they suddenly lost the spiritual pillar that was the reason for their existence.</p><p>Suddenly, Tang Xiu asked again, “Since you haven’t thought about it, then let me change my question. You should’ve been imprisoned by the Sacred Pristine Palace for more than 100,000 years here. But it’s impossible for you all to live this long in a place with negligible world spiritual energy. How can you still live until now?”</p><p>“It’s because of the Diablo Praecantator Forbidden Curse, the Life and Death Nightmare.”</p><p>Diablo Praecantator Forbidden Curse?</p><p>The Life and Death Nightmare?</p><p>Wearing a disbelieving and incredulous look, Tang Xiu hurriedly asked, “That legend is real? Such a dreadful curse really exist?”</p><p>Note:</p><p>Did they use Chinese to converse, though? Damn plot holes.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
