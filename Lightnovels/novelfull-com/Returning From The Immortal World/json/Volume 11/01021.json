Why have you been chasing Yang Yan so hard? To think that you must put her death, do you know that the Huangs are no longer pursuing the matter about Zuo Daquan and Zuo Qing?”</p><p>Guo Fugui was surprised and asked in a deep voice, “You also know the matter between the Huang and Zuo Families? Who… who are you?”</p><p>“Don’t you know me already?” asked Tang Xiu back smilingly. “I’m the owner of this Everlasting Feast Hall.”</p><p>“No way.” Gu Fugui frowned and shook his head. “From what I know, the Everlasting Feast Hall’s Boss is Gu Xiaoxue. Where the hell did you come from?”</p><p>“That’s not your concern for you now since you must think about your own safety,” replied Tang Xiu. “I already told you that my men are responsible to escort the Yang siblings away. You can find me if you don’t like it, though I believe you’ll regret it.”</p><p>“I’ll regret it? Just relying on you alone?” Guo Fugui sneered. “Do you think you’re that great just because you’re the owner of the Everlasting Feast Hall? I’m telling you brat! You must face me and the Huangs of the Fukang Province behind me since you’re sheltering the Yang siblings! The Huangs want Zuo Daquan and Zuo Qing’s lives and I wanna kill Yang Yan who helped Zuo Qing escape. You’ll die if you don’t give me an explanation today!”</p><p>“I told you all the grudges between the Huangs and Zuo Daquan have all been written off! The Huangs will no longer pursue Zuo Qing anymore. As for Yang Yan, she just helped her friend—a favor to whom she paid her debt and got little to do with all the issues. You had better drag your men out of this place if you know what’s good for you and never pester Zuo Qing and the Yang siblings anymore in the future. Remember, this is the chance I’m giving you on the account of the Huang Patriarch, Huang Jinfu. You can choose otherwise, but then I won’t spare you even if Huang Jinfu comes here!”</p><p>Guo Fugui looked at Tang Xiu as though the young man was some kind of an idiot, sighing. “Tsk, tsk. You know, Kid, who the fuck do you think you are? Are you taking me for an idiot? You did that on the account of Huang Jinfu’s face? You got no idea how to read a dead word and the immensity of Heaven and Earth or something?”</p><p>Having said that, he paced back a few steps and flung his hand down.</p><p>Suddenly, dozens of strong men raised their machetes and other weapons. Some of them even pulled out their pistols and trained the muzzles at Tang Xiu and the rest.</p><p>However, Tang Xiu was unmoved. But his expression turned frosty and he ordered, “Men, you can discard them, but refrain from killing! Just pack up these social scum. At least you’re reducing some harm to those good people outside.”</p><p>“Hmph, so heroic and true, aren’t you?” Guo Fugui jeered. “Do you think you’re some lawman? It’s so fucking funny!”</p><p>Tang Xiu shook his head yet again and just watched as Mo Awu’s group of five threw themselves into the crowd in a flash. They were just like tigers that ran over a flock of sheep, using only a simple and brutal way to strike them. The other party simply had not enough time to fight back, even those middle-aged men armed with pistols and firearms had their tendons cut off by Mo Awu’s dagger in a flash.</p><p>In just a few seconds, dozens of ruthless men had been easily knocked down by Mo Awu’s group of five. A thick smell of air wafted in the air along with miserable shrieks. Guo Fugui, who thought that victory was already in his hands, was dumbfounded and felt a frosty chill filling his heart.</p><p>How is this possible?</p><p>All of his men were talents he recruited himself and all had martial arts background. The most powerful of whom had participated in the martial arts competition and obtained top results.</p><p>A faint smile crept up on Tang Xiu’s face as he floated down from the car’s roof and looked at the shocked Guo Fugui. “I just gave you an opportunity. Pity that you chose to waste it. I don’t care even if you mention anything about the Fukang Province’s Huang Family anymore. Kneel and kowtow now if you don’t wanna end up as miserable as your men!”</p><p>Kneel down?!!</p><p>Intense murderous intent burst in Guo Fugui’s eyes. He may not have absolute power in Jingmen all these years, yet he was never one who was at the mercy of others either. If he acted like a soft coward, how could he set a foothold in Jingmen Island in the future? How would he still have the face to face others later?</p><p>Suddenly, he grabbed a pistol from his waist and stepped back while facing Tang Xiu. “Your men are very powerful. They are just as good as the martial arts grandmasters I know. But I wanna see if they are faster than bullets. Don’t force my hand. I’ve won many shooting competitions, and blasting your head is very easy for me.”</p><p>“WOW!” Tang Xiu applauded and chuckled. “No wonder you can have such big businesses in Jingmen Island. But you seem to have made a mistake. Didn’t you see that your men also have guns and how they ended up?”</p><p>Complexion turning as white as a sheet, Guo Fugui called out densely, “They were just taken out by your men by surprise, no biggie. I don’t wanna kill you, Kid. But don’t force my hand. Let’s end this shit for now, but you must give me an explanation for letting Yang Yan go!”</p><p>“Hmph. You got no idea how blind and reckless you are.” Tang Xiu shook his head and snorted.</p><p>Whoosh…</p><p>Mo Awu’s figure flickered and instantly appeared in front of Guo Fugui. As his hand caught the gun in Guo Fugui’s hand lightning-fast, his other hand punched Guo Fugui’s cheek, causing the man to scream out and his cheekbone caved in. His body then flew to the right and slammed down.</p><p>BAM…</p><p>Guo Fugui’s burly and vigorous body fell on the concrete floor. The man felt the pain he had never felt for a very long time on his cheek and body as he fell.</p><p>Tang Xiu just glanced at him apathetically and said in a deep voice, “Stun all of them and let them wrap their injuries. I don’t want them to die in our place.”</p><p>“Understood!”</p><p>Mo Awu’s group of five immediately broke the legs of those who had fallen to the ground wailing. After stunning them, they quickly took out the bandages to treat their bleeding injuries.</p><p>A few minutes later, police flashing lights were seen as more than a dozen police cars came roaring. Tang Xiu and the rest watched them come as they quickly came to the parking lot. A lot of policemen and SWAT members rushed out of the cars as they aimed their guns at Tang Xiu and the rest.</p><p>Li Daoren, who was the city leader and was the most powerful man in Jingmen Island, inhaled cold air upon seeing the scene in front. But Xing Ting and Wang Sen had their eyes bulged out and looked horrified. Despite being experienced in leading the operation to fight against many lawless elements, where could they have seen such a scene? A total of forty-odd people fell on the ground like dead dogs, unknown if they were still alive or dead. The rest of the policemen were so shocked by the scene that their hands were slightly trembling.</p><p>Li Daoren strode forward and asked in a deep voice, “Which one of you is Mr. Tang?”</p><p>“That’s me,” answered Tang Xiu with a smile.</p><p>“Hello, Mr. Tang. Please show me your credentials.” Li Daoren nodded.</p><p>Tang Xiu directly took out the green book of the Security Department and handed it over to him, saying, “You’re not bad for coming over in such a short time. However, I’m really disappointed with the public security order in Jingmen Island. I just rescued two people late at night from these people, and then they came here to retaliate and kill me in my own place. Just look at the weapons, pistols, and other firearms on the ground, for god’s sake! Don’t you know these people are supposed to be the black forces?”</p><p>Upon seeing several large characters inscribed on the green notebook, Li Daoren’s pupils instantly shrunk. He flipped the papers a few times, then he gave it back to Tang Xiu and said bitterly, “I’m Li Daoren, Secretary of Jingmen Island. I apologize to you, Mr. Tang. You can rest assured that I’ll thoroughly investigate this matter to prevent it from happening again in the future.”</p><p>“As a city official, providing a peaceful living and working environment for the common people is the minimum responsibility. The Everlasting Feast Hall’s security guards have subdued these criminals, so I’ll hand them all to you.” Tang Xiu nodded.</p><p>“These people have violated the laws, I assure you that they will face trial by law.” Li Daoren immediately nodded and said, “It’s all thanks to you, Mr. Tang. If it weren’t for you, I’m afraid all these felons would go unpunished and be beyond the arm of the law!”</p><p>“It’s my duty and responsibility, there’s no need to be polite,” said Tang Xiu with a smile. “Also, the leader’s name is Guo Fugui. I heard he has quite a power in Jingmen Island with many shady and illegal businesses. I hope you can completely investigate all the bad deeds this man has done.”</p><p>The Police Chief, Xing Ting, immediately replied, “I’m Xing Ting, the City Police Department’s Chief, Mr. Tang. I must apologize for everything that happened today. You can rest assured that we will completely investigate Guo Fugui inside out aside from the crime he has committed today. We’ll leave no stone unturned and throw him into the prison if there’s anything else.”</p><p>“Alright, then. Take them away!” said Tang Xiu smilingly.</p><p>At this time, two SUVs drove fast and entered as they quickly stopped next to the police cars. Ouyang Lei, surrounded by several strong men, pushed the police blockade aside and came toward Tang Xiu and Li Daoren, asking with a curious face, “What happened here and why are you here too, Uncle?”</p><p>Li Daoren pointed to Tang Xiu and answered, “It was an emergency call from the Security Department official, Mr. Tang. He found some criminals attacking the Everlasting Feast Hall, so I came here personally. What about you? It’s so late at night and you’re still up. What are you here for?”</p><p>“Huh? Tang Xiu is from the Security Department? That’s so damn amazing!” exclaimed Ouyang Lei with a strange expression. “Anyway, you don’t recall anything about Tang Xiu’s identity, Uncle?”</p><p>“Ehh? What identity are you talking about?” asked Li Daoren back with a confused face.</p><p>Cough, cough…</p><p>Tang Xiu was at a loss whether he had to cry or laugh. He never dreamed that Li Daoren, whom he just gave a sermon, turned out to be Ouyang Lei and Ouyang Lulu’s uncle. That meant he should also call him Uncle according to seniority, right?</p><p>Ouyang Lei looked at Li Daoren first before shifting to Tang Xiu, who wore a forced, dry smile. He immediately burst into laughter and said, “Oh my… Uncle, how many people in China are called Tang Xiu? Which Tang Xiu could it be other than the one who is related to the Ouyang Family?</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
