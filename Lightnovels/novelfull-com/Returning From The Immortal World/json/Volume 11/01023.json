The little fairy’s cry was completely shut and he put the vessel into the interspatial ring. Just as he was about to speak, Gu Yan’er suddenly appeared in front of him.</p><p>“I just sensed the appearance of a spiritual being, Master,” said Gu Yan’er with a puzzled look. She was donning her usual white attire.</p><p>“Yeah. It’s the spoiled princess of the Violet Fairy Clan whom I happened to meet. I bought her from the slave trader after her clan was destroyed. I have no idea how she came to Earth, but something is sure to be related to her.”</p><p>Gu Yan’er’s face slightly changed. It was the woman she never liked Tang Xiu mentioning. She hesitated for a moment and then said, “Do you perhaps want me to exterminate this Violet Fairy Princess?”</p><p>“No.” Tang Xiu shook his head and said, “I’ll need to use her to verify something.”</p><p>Gu Yan’er nodded wordlessly.</p><p>At the moment Ouyang Lei saw Gu Yan’er, he seemed to be struck by lightning that paralyzed his whole person. He had seen numerous beauties, even the best-looking ones, yet he was sure that none of them could compare to Gu Yan’er. She was simply a Goddess who possessed a holy and sacred beauty that stirred his very soul and made his heart beat faster.</p><p>He once heard that such a holy and pure beautiful Goddess must only be gazed at from the distance and was not be blasphemed. It was the saying he had always been scornful at; something that people exaggerated since there was no such woman in this world. But now, he believed it. He even thought that it would be blasphemy if he looked at her directly.</p><p>“B-B… future bro-in-law, w-who… who is she?”</p><p>After he woke up from his daze, he stutteringly asked with a blushing face and thumping heart.</p><p>Tang Xiu looked at him with an odd expression and answered, “She’s my disciple and the founder of this Everlasting Feast Hall. Why?”</p><p>“Come again?!!”</p><p>Ouyang Lei was utterly dumbfounded. This soul-shaking beauty in front of him looked like she was just 20 years old. How could she be the founder of the Everlasting Feast Hall? Everyone knows this restaurant was founded decades ago. There was no way its founder was younger than 20-odd years, right? So to say… this goddess… was already 40-something-years-old?!</p><p>He didn’t notice that Gu Yan’er was looking at him with chilling eyes after he called Tang Xiu with that address. Neither did he feel that the temperature around him had dropped several degrees.</p><p>“Are you making fun of me, future bro-in-law? I can barely accept if she’s your disciple. But it’s impossible for her to be the founder of the Everlasting Feast Hall! How old is she and how long has the Everlasting Feast Hall been founded for?” Ouyang Lei finally no longer stuttered as he asked in disbelief.</p><p>“Shut your mouth!” Gu Yan’er was longer able to endure and angrily snapped. “If you address Master like that again, I’ll take your soul away and burn it with the Nine Hells Flame until your soul scatters into nothingness and you never reincarnate!”</p><p>Address?</p><p>Never did it occur to Ouyang Lei that such a breathtaking beauty would go ballistic at him with such vicious words all of a sudden.</p><p>But… it is just the correct address, right? Tang Xiu is my Sis’s boyfriend, so calling him my future bro-in-law since they haven’t married yet is the proper address, no?</p><p>“Yan’er.”</p><p>Although Tang Xiu didn’t want Ouyang Lei to address him as “future brother-in-law” either, this guy was still Ouyang Lulu’s older brother. He didn’t want to make him look ugly regardless. Not to mention that this fella just gave him a favor by bringing the Violet Fairy.</p><p>Gu Yan’er came to Tang Xiu’s side and immediately wrapped Tang Xiu’s hand with her right after she took a seat, saying with an unhappy face, “Master, Yan’er doesn’t want you to be addressed as such. Besides, you haven’t married his sister. He can’t just advance a relationship like this. If you don’t want him to address you as such, then I’ll seal his mouth.”</p><p>Cough, cough…</p><p>Tang Xiu coughed a few times and glanced at the stunned and shrunk Ouyang Lei. He let out a dry chuckle and said, “Yan’er, Ouyang Lei is Lulu’s brother. He’s one of us. Talk a bit more politely to him, alright. Also, Ouyang Lei. Pay attention to what you speak out later and please don’t use ‘future brother-in-law’ to address me. Naming someone sometimes will make others resentful.”</p><p>Nodding like a chicken pecking rice, Ouyang Lei hurriedly replied, “No… alright… Tang Xiu brother. I’ll never call you with a random address later then. Uh… well… Ms. Yan’er… I’m really sorry about the jokes I made. Please don’t mind it.”</p><p>Gu Yan’er’s face changed again and she scornfully replied, “No one can call me Yan’er beside Master! Those who did have died already, so keep in mind that I’m surnamed Gu!”</p><p>Ouyang Lei was really vexed. He would’ve been snapped already if it wasn’t the fact that this goddess was too beautiful. While suppressing his depression, he let out a dry smile and said, “I understand, Ms. Gu.”</p><p>At his reply, Gu Yan’er snorted and turned to look at Tang Xiu. Her tone changed again and spoke with a bit of coy, “Master, there’s something Yan’er was wanting to tell you in private.”</p><p>Feeling helpless inwardly, Tang Xiu was well aware that it was Gu Yan’er’s way of kicking Ouyang Lei out. He looked at the fella with a dry smile and said, “Well, you should go back first if there’s nothing else, Brother Lei! I’ll send the immortal sword to the Ouyang residence through Xiaoxue in two days at most.”</p><p>“Ehh? What immortal sword, Master?” asked Gu Yan’er curiously.</p><p>“The Ouyangs found the Violet Fairy for me, so I promised to compensate them with an immortal sword,” answered Tang Xiu.</p><p>Gu Yan’er understood instantly and took a finely shaped immortal sword from her interspatial ring. She threw it to Ouyang Lei and said, “This is the immortal sword Master promised you. Take the sword and go quickly! It’s in the middle of the night and my Master must rest even if you don’t!”</p><p>It made Ouyang Lei so depressed that he wanted to vomit blood. He couldn’t figure out why such a beautiful goddess like Gu Yan’er would be so relentless to trample his feelings. She just euphemistically drove him away, and now blatantly kicked him out. It was Tang Xiu who asked him to come here, for God’s sake! Why would he rush to Everlasting Feast Hall at this time otherwise?!</p><p>As he got up and prepared to leave, he suddenly recalled something very important and said with a hollow smile, “Well, uh… Ms. Gu, I still have something to ask Tang Xiu, you see…”</p><p>“Just say it if you shill have something to say,” replied Tang Xiu with an expression being at a loss whether he had to cry or laugh.</p><p>“Well, you haven’t taught me the technique to refine and control this immortal sword! It’s kinda useless for me to take it back, no?!” said Ouyang Lei with a somewhat peculiar face.</p><p>Without waiting for Tang Xiu’s reply, Gu Yan’er raised her fair hand and flicked a series of golden runes to enter Ouyang Lei’s soul sea. “That’s the technique to refine and manipulate the immortal sword. I’ve directly engraved it in your soul sea. You can learn it yourself later after you go back.”</p><p>Yet, it made Ouyang Lei stunned in fright as fear frantically erupted in his heart. He truly found many golden runes in his mind all of a sudden; a very strange situation that far exceeded his cognition.</p><p>“Brother Lei, Yan’er is correct. She has sent the technique to refine and manipulate the immortal sword into your soul sea, so you can learn it after you back,” said Tang Xiu.</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>Ouyang Lei stood up, still looking dazed and walked out of the room with the immortal sword as he came to the parking lot. He looked as if he just awakened from a dream as he sat in his S-series Mercedes Benz, sobering up with cold sweat due to fright. Ignoring his men’s inquiries about where to go, he quickly looked at the golden runes as they immediately changed to tiny rays of light that fluttered in his soul sea and dissipated in just a few seconds.</p><p>This is so fantastic. Very mysterious! If someone keeps using this mysterious method to put all kinds of knowledge into my brain, then I only need to look at it and just master it completely! That’s so fucking cool!</p><p>But how did she do it, though? Is this a technique any cultivator can perform? If so, I must become one in the future, so I can also perform this kind of marvelous technique!</p><p>Ouyang Lei clenched his fist and waved it a few times before loudly issuing an order, “Go back to the family!”</p><p>****</p><p>Inside the room.</p><p>Tang Xiu looked at Gu Yan’er and asked, “You just said that you got something to talk about. What is it?”</p><p>Gu Yan’er chuckled. “Uh, hehe. It was just an excuse to make Ouyang Lei leave. Anyway, I’ve already collected the exquisite pagoda, Master. When are we going to Nine Dragons Island?”</p><p>“We’re setting out now!” said Tang Xiu. “The place has been hectic for the last two days and there are also traces of cultivators. Letting the Everlasting Feast Hall’s members fight those people without proper preparation in advance is bound to inflict losses on us. Besides, the existence of the Nine Dragons Island must not be exposed, so I’m planning to find a deserted island and lay out a large geomancy array there to attract the attention of practitioners all over the world.”</p><p>“You can hand over the matter to me, Master,” said Gu Yan’er smilingly.</p><p>“No.” Tang Xiu shook his head and said, “The Heavenly Dao of this plane is suppressing you. Even if you have the power of an immortal, you cannot easily unleash it here. Besides, you have yet to recover from your injuries, so you mustn’t use your ability too much. I’ll do the work and you only need to place the exquisite pagoda and recuperate inside it later.”</p><p>Gu Yan’er gave it a thought and nodded. “Yan’er will follow your arrangements, Master.”</p><p>Quickly, Tang Xiu, Gu Yan’er, and Gu Xiaoxue appeared in the parking lot, where a dozen members of the Everlasting Feast Hall had arrived and were waiting for them.</p><p>Tang Xiu glanced around at them before his vision landed on Chi Nan and said, “Chi Nan, you’re staying here to take care of the Everlasting Feast Hall’s business. You’re the general manager of the restaurant from now on. Someone else will come a year later to replace you, so you can go to Nine Dragons Island to cultivate.”</p><p>“I…”</p><p>Instinctively, Chi Nan wanted to decline since she really wanted to go to Nine Dragons Island to fight with those who had been harassing the island. However, under Tang Xiu’s gaze, she could only brace herself to nod and accept the assignment.</p><p>“I know you feel wronged.” Tang Xiu chuckled and said, “But you know, you’ll have a double allotment of annual resources from the headquarters for each year as your compensation!”</p><p>“Thank you, Boss!” Most of Chi Nan’s depressed emotions dissipated upon hearing this.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
