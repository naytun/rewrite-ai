However, it would only need a few seconds with Gu Yan’er bringing Tang Xiu and a dozen members of the Everlasting Feast Hall and arriving outside the Nine Dragons Island’s array.</p><p>“I’m afraid that only Master can lay out such a sophisticated great array on the whole Earth. Even Ji Chimei won’t be able to arrange it as well as you, Master.” Gu Yan’er sighed in admiration with a smile.</p><p>At her comment, Tang Xiu slightly smiled. He then looked at the dozen core member of the Everlasting Feast Hall who looked shocked and dumbfounded, saying, “Let’s not waste time here. Besides, it’s easy to enter with your strength.”</p><p>Gu Yan’er faintly smiled before her figure flickered and she suddenly appeared on the square in front of the palace of Nine Dragons Island. Dozens of figures flickered and moved lightning-fast as the experts around appeared in front of the group in just a few breaths.</p><p>“Boss!”</p><p>More than ten experts looked pleasantly surprised, saluting to Tang Xiu and Gu Yan’er.</p><p>Waving his hand, Tang Xiu ordered, “Go tend to your work! Also, tell Awen to see me.”</p><p>“Understood!”</p><p>Quickly, a dozen men dispersed, whereas Mo Awen, who had received the notice, appeared before Tang Xiu and Gu Yan’er at his fastest speed. An exciting look flashed in his eyes especially upon seeing Gu Yan’er as he reverentially bowed at her.</p><p>“Awen, they just came here, so you are to settle them first. Then, summon all the core members to the assembly point. I have important things to announce,” ordered Tang Xiu.</p><p>Mo Awu received the order and nodded repeatedly before leaving with more than a dozen of people. He already knew his Boss’ personality—Tang Xiu would never rush to summon everyone if there was no important matter to report. Ever since most of the Everlasting Feast Hall’s core members arrived in Nine Dragons Island, the Boss had also taught them at the small conference hall.</p><p>“Master!”</p><p>Gu Yin looked like a dancing butterfly flying in the air with her color dress fluttering. Her crisp laughter wafted in the air from the distance before she flung herself and hugged Tang Xiu affectionately.</p><p>With a beaming face, Tang Xiu picked her up and hugged her. After turning her around twice, he put her down and smilingly said, “Yinyin, greet your Senior Sister.”</p><p>Gu Yin gazed at Gu Yan’er and immediately imitated the posture of the Everlasting Feast Hall’s members and saluted. “Yinyin pays respect to Senior Sister.”</p><p>A smile outlined on the corner of Gu Yan’er’s mouth. She then handed her a top-grade immortal sword along with some ancient talismans. While smiling, she spoke, “I give you the immortal sword with its refining and manipulating art. There are also some secret arts I once comprehended for you to learn. You’ll be able to read the secret art’s contents once you reach the Nascent Soul Stage. Also, Yinyin, you have a special physique; one that is very rare in the Immortal World. I’m sure you’ll have limitless achievements in the future if you practice diligently.”</p><p>“I’ll definitely work hard and cultivate diligently, Senior Sister.” Gu Yin firmly nodded and said, “You can expect me to protect you and Master in the future.”</p><p>“Hehe…” Gu Yan’er covered her mouth and chuckled while gently stroking Gu Yin’s black hair affectionately.</p><p>Shortly after, Tang Xiu introduced Mu Qingping to Gu Yan’er who also came. Having experienced many things in the Immortal World, Gu Yan’er was naturally aware of what it meant for being her Master’s steward. It meant that Mu Qingping was someone her Master trusted the most, while also being Gu Yin’s mother. Thus, she acted very politely to her, though her mannerisms made Mu Qingping feel flattered greatly.</p><p>Two hours later, apart from the dozen of the Everlasting Feast Hall’s core members who were performing their mission around the world, everyone else on the island had rushed to the main assembly hall in the central area of Nine Dragons Island. The hall was large enough to accommodate 100,000 people, so it looked pretty empty with only a little more than 100 people inside now.</p><p>With hands crossed behind his back, Tang Xiu stood straight on the podium on the northern end of the site. On his left was Gu Yan’er, Mu Qingping on the right, while his eyes glanced around at more than 100 core members of the Everlasting Feast Hall.</p><p>“Everyone is here, Boss.” Mo Awen came from the outside of the venue lightning-fast and respectfully reported as he came before Tang Xiu.</p><p>After Tang Xiu nodded at him, Mo Awen returned to the orderly row below the stage. Then, he started speaking in a deep voice, “Today is the time most of the core members of the Everlasting Feast Hall gathered together. Even my disciple Gu Yan’er is also attending. We’ve been getting along for nearly two years now, so I believe all of you have already understood my character and temper. Herein I announce that the Everlasting Feast Hall is now dissolved. But today is also the day our new sect is established! Now I’m asking you all. Who among you is unhappy? Those who feel so can quit now. But if you all choose to stay, you will be demanded unquestionable loyalty for you will face battles and required to be more formidable and powerful in the future!”</p><p>“Is there anyone who wants to quit?”</p><p>Nearly 200 people in the entire assembly hall looked at Tang Xiu with solemn looks. No one spoke and only firm and fanatical looks were on their faces. They raised their right fists, placing them on their left chest.</p><p>“Very good!” Tang Xiu continued with a satisfied look. “I will need you all to follow me in the future; to fight side-by-side with me. You will fight and kill millions of enemies; to contend will myriads of races. All of you will follow me to step on the mountain of corpses and bathe in the sea of blood to fight our way to reach the apex in the Immortal World, the Demon Realm, Monster Realm, Spirit Realm, Buddhist Realm, Ghost Realm, as well as countless mysterious small worlds. As long as you live and as long as you follow my footsteps, there will appear some among you who will follow me to the higher plane of the God’s Realm far above the immortals, demons, monsters, and spirits!</p><p>“The immortals are existences you look up to, like would Gods to me. Following me means that you must be prepared to kill the immortals and kill the gods when you encounter them. You might be fated to meet your death where your souls may be spirited away and disappear forever in the world. But as long as you live, you’ll be able to become the existences that countless people will look up to.</p><p>“The Everlasting Feast Hall was built by Yan’er as a small force, a temporary means to find me. From now on, the Everlasting Feast Hall will serve as a pure restaurant, a business in the land of China to make money for buying resources. But now… we need a much stronger society. And that is a sect!”</p><p>“It’s the Tang Sect. Our sect is called Tang Sect from henceforth, and I’ll be its first Sect Master!”</p><p>When Tang Xiu’s speech came to this point, his countenance turned extremely solemn. He looked at the excited and thrilled members and felt satisfied inwardly. He could sense their respects and worship. He could also feel that they loved this collective society, be it the Everlasting Feast Hall or the now Tang Sect.</p><p>It was a deep sense of belonging and support that were the very foundation of a sect!</p><p>It was very difficult for a single tree to become a forest. Only the sense of belonging, approval, and supports of many people could the entire sect develop and become much stronger and stronger in the future.</p><p>“Tang Sect!”</p><p>“Tang Sect!”</p><p>“Tang Sect!”</p><p>The yells were like the roaring waves as they soared tens of meters high and pierced through the roof. The voices streaked into the sky, causing all the Heaven and Earth to tremble.</p><p>At the same time, the sunny sky above the vault of heaven turned dim all of a sudden. In just half a minute, clouds gathered along with flashes of lightning and the rumbling of thunder!</p><p>Antiquity aura loomed over the Nine Dragons Island while gigantic pressure fell down from the firmament. In but a flash, the Nine Dragons Island was shaking as though it would be broken at any time.</p><p>Standing beside Tang Xiu, Gu Yan’er looked grim and cold. Her figure flickered and she instantly disappeared as she appeared hundreds of meters high in the sky in a flash. A sword slashed into the sky unleashing constant fearsome might. In just a flash, the world fell still.</p><p>“BREAK!”</p><p>A hazy shadow detached from Gu Yan’er and expanded ten million times in a flash. Just like a towering pillar that supported the sky, the sword light shattered the dark clouds and lightning blasts. The invisible gigantic net hidden in the dark clouds and the lightning were torn apart and shattered by the sword formed by the phantom.</p><p>Then, the clouds unfolded while the lightning and thunders dissipated.</p><p>As the world reverted back to its sunny sky, Gu Yan’er crazily coughed up a mouthful of blood. Yet she looked frenzied and wildly laughed at the firmament before her body fell downward.</p><p>Tang Xiu and the nearly 200 members of Tang Sect rushed out of the assembly hall. Although they didn’t witness what Gu Yan’er had done, they could guess some of it.</p><p>“Yan’er!!!”</p><p>Tang Xiu was so angry and furious for he never dreamed that the establishment of the Tang Sect would trigger such a world phenomenon. He never expected that the Heavenly Dao of this plane would sense him and even sent down the Heavenly Lightning Wrath. Neither did he expect that Gu Yan’er would be so rash to straightly faced against and break the power of the Heavenly Dao.</p><p>His figure turned like a rocket shell and instantly appeared hundreds of meters high mid-air to hug Gu Yan’er’s falling body. Tang Xiu looked at the bloodstain on her lips, yet wore a beaming smile. He couldn’t help but scold her with concern and distress. “Did you want to die or something? You have yet to recover from serious injuries. Use your head before you do something in the future, disobedient girl! Regardless of the Heavenly Dao punishment and the Thunder Baptism it sent down, they won’t be able to break through the shield array I’ve arranged on this island, nor will it affect anyone here.”</p><p>Gu Yan’er coughed a few times. She rubbed her delicate face on Tang Xiu’s chest and weakly said, “I won’t let even the Heavenly Dao bully you, Master. The Tang Sect is the first sect you’ve established and the family you will devote your blood and efforts to. Yan’er must protect Master and the Tang Sect even if it costs me my life.”</p><p>Tang Xiu shivered inwardly and just looked at Gu Yan’er’s beaming face. He didn’t blame her again and gently kissed her forehead, murmuring, “I may have done a lot of good deeds in my life, but the most correct decision I’ve made was to raise you up and take you as a disciple.”</p><p>His murmur made Gu Yan’er elated. The ripple of happiness filled her heart and her eyes were full of joy like spring waves surging with brilliance. She grasped Tang Xiu’s hand and whispered, “I’ll always be your disciple and child, but I’m not satisfied, Master. I still want to be your woman, to live with you for generations to come until the universe meets its demise. No longer will Yan’er be willing to be separated from Master even if the Immortal World and the God’s realm go old and face destruction!”</p><p>Tang Xiu no longer spoke and just hugged her tighter. Be it her status as his disciple or woman, he was perfectly conscious at this moment as he hugged her. Gu Yan’er had already taken root in his heart, even in the deepest recess of his soul. The feeling that was such would never be easy to be touched again.</p><p>Once upon a time, there were only two women who took root deep in his heart. One was his mother, Su Lingyun, who had been haunting his dreams back when he was in the Immortal World for thousands of years. The other one was his beloved wife, Xue Qingcheng. And yet, she was also the very one who created a wound his heart and soul.</p><p>And now, there was another one in his heart—Gu Yan’er.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
