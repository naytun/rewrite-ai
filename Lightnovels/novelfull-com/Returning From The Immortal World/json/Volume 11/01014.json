Some amazing spells have fearsome power, and you’ll find yourself in a very difficult situation if you have no spells equal in power. If you battle powerhouses, you may lose your life no matter how trivial the difference in skills between you and your enemies is.”</p><p>Mo Awu fell into silence. What Tang Xiu had said shook him to the core. Only at this moment did he realize how naïve had he always been. Being a cultivator turned out that one didn’t need to be a versatile person, yet one must have enough proficiency in everything.</p><p>More so that having more skills was never a bad thing. As long as one had enough skills, plus his own strength, one would be able to sweep the enemies away. Only then did one truly become the best warrior.</p><p>With a respectful face, Mo Awu saluted. “I understand your admonishment, Boss. Please rest assured that I’ll definitely learn more knowledge and master more skills in the future. I wish to be the best warrior under you, and I’d like you to instruct me more in the future.”</p><p>“I’ll support you as long as you’re willing, Awu,” said Tang Xiu with a faint smile. “You must remember that what I need is true powerhouses. Only those who’re truly powerful who will be qualified to follow me in the future. You won’t keep staying beside me and charge forward to face the enemies if you are surpassed by others.”</p><p>Mo Awu tightly gripped his fist and firmly said, “I will definitely double my efforts, Boss. Rest assured.”</p><p>“Alright, go to Ji Chimei and ask her cultivation resources for half a year once we return to Nine Dragons Island.” Tang Xiu nodded and smilingly said, “Consider it as the compensation for the blood of the high-rank fierce beast you gave me!”</p><p>Mo Awu didn’t decline and respectfully said, “Thank you, Boss!”</p><p>He didn’t decline because cultivation resources were a very significant need for every cultivator. Although he was not short on cultivation resources at the present, he knew that the higher his cultivation level was, the more he needed those cultivation resources in the future. Rather than having a headache due to being short on cultivation resources in the future, it was better to hoard more of them now.</p><p>After giving Mo Awu a short lecture, Tang Xiu spent all day long refining and was finally able to manufacture 200 magic swords. However, he refined two more to give Zuo Daquan and Kanaja one each.</p><p>“Let’s leave!”</p><p>After storing everything into his interspatial ring, Tang Xiu and Mo Awu left the underground warehouse. When he appeared above ground, the rubble had been cleaned up and many trucks with building materials had arrived at the site. There were also several cranes working to place a large number of building materials everywhere.</p><p>“Divine Doctor Tang!”</p><p>Zuo Qing grabbed her two son’s little hands and came to Tang Xiu. A vibrant smile painted her face as she looked at Tang Xiu with a warm expression.</p><p>“How come are you here? Didn’t your father arrange for you to stay in downtown Bangkok?” asked Tang Xiu with a smile.</p><p>“Ah, living there is so boring, so we kind of escaped and ran back here,” replied Zuo Qing with a smile. “Anyway, I heard from Dad that you were in the underground warehouse, so we waited here. Also, are you going back to China soon, Divine Doctor Tang?”</p><p>“Yeah.” Tang Xiu nodded. “I’ll immediately rush to the airport.”</p><p>The smile on Zuo Qing’s face disappeared and she said in a low voice, “Well… could you help me with something?”</p><p>“Just say it. What is it can I do for you?” asked Tang Xiu with a smile.</p><p>Zuo Qing said, “I was able to flee China with my two sons due to the help of my father’s friend and my bosom friend. But for the sake of helping me, she ended up offending a gangster-like guy in Jingmen Island. She said that she immediately went to Beijing to hide after the three of us left Jingmen Island. I called her a few times but couldn’t contact her at all. Could you find and help her after returning to China?”</p><p>“What’s her name? Give me her number and home address,” said Tang Xiu. “Don’t worry! As long as I can find her and she’s in trouble, I’ll help her.”</p><p>“Thank you, Divine Doctor Tang. You’re really a good person,” said Zuo Qing gratefully.</p><p>“Alright, but please don’t label me as a good guy.” Tang Xiu smilingly said, “Anyway, I got not much time since we need to rush to Jingmen Island. I also have some gifts for these two little guys!”</p><p>“No need to…” said Zuo Qing.</p><p>Tang Xiu interrupted her by raising his hand. He took two jade pendant necklaces from his interspatial ring and hung them on their necks, and then smilingly said, “Remember, don’t take them off no matter what happens. Keep them wearing it as it may save their lives when they encounter any danger in the future.</p><p>****</p><p>As dusk came, Tang Xiu and Mo Awu arrived at Bangkok Airport. Just as their car parked in the parking lot, Kanaja hurried rushed to them with several bodyguards.</p><p>“Everything has been arranged, Mr. Tang. Your flight will take off at 8:30 PM and you should arrive at Jingmen Island Airport at 1:00 AM. Since you have no passport and proper visa to enter Thailand, the flight attendants will arrange for you to stay in their workplace. Are you alright with this arrangement?” asked Kanaja respectfully.</p><p>“It’s fine as long as we can return to China smoothly.” Tang Xiu nodded and smilingly said, “Nobody can stop me once we arrive in China. That’s right. I’m giving you this magic sword. It doesn’t have many uses for you, but it’s a genuine magic weapon nonetheless. You can regard it as a family heirloom you can pass on to your descendants in the future, though.”</p><p>Kanaja looked excited and seemed to regard the sword as an exquisite art. The moment he received it, he could sense a cool aura entering his arm and body through his palm. He originally felt a bit uncomfortable due to the hot weather, but he now felt cool and refreshed.</p><p>He couldn’t help but sigh in praise. “What a great treasure!”</p><p>Inwardly, Tang Xiu felt a bit amused. This man was not a cultivator. How could he tell the quality of magic tools? However, without breaking Kanaja’s imagination, he said smilingly, “The magic weapons and tools I refine are always of top quality. You provided me a lot of gold, silver, bronze, and iron before, so I’ll give you another one aside from this magic weapon.”</p><p>“What is it?”</p><p>Curiosity appeared on Kanaja’s face and his heart was full of expectation. For someone as extraordinary as Tang Xiu, he thought that anything Tang Xiu gave him would very likely be unordinary.</p><p>Tang Xiu took out a jade pendant from his interspatial ring and handed it to him. “I refined this magic tool for protection purposes when I had some free time. But I didn’t have enough refining materials back then, so the effect only lasts for three uses. But you must remember to wear it every day since it can protect you from any danger thrice.”</p><p>“But this is just a jade pendant, Mr. Tang. How can it help me, exactly?” asked Kanaja, looking confused.</p><p>“It will form an invisible protective shield that will cover your body once you are attacked,” said Tang Xiu with a smile. “Even if someone shoots you with a powerful sniper rifle at a close range, it’s impossible to kill you.”</p><p>“This object is that powerful?” Kanaja was shocked to hear how powerful this body protection tool was. For it to be able to nullify a sniper rifle’s bullet at point-blank range, wasn’t it something that even the best bulletproof vest was unable to achieve? If the effect was really as good as Tang Xiu said, then it was equal to having three more lives!</p><p>“Don’t worry. I’d never lie to you about that!” Assured Tang Xiu with a smile. “Well, you can, of course, test it if you don’t believe it, though.”</p><p>“Test it? How?” asked Kanaja hurriedly.</p><p>“Wear this jade pendant magic tool after you get back and order one of your men to shoot at you at close range,” Tang Xiu explained smilingly. “Well, if you’re afraid to try it, you can just tell someone else to wear it and shoot him yourself.”</p><p>“I understand. Thank you, Mr. Tang,” said Kanaja respectfully. “This jade pendant magic tool is much better for me than the magic sword, actually.”</p><p>****</p><p>At Bangkok Airport.</p><p>The flight from Bangkok to China’s Jingmen Island had finally landed. To show his regard and concern to Tang Xiu as someone of great importance, Kanaja personally led Tang Xiu and Mo Awu to the plane, where he greeted the captain and other staff and smoothly brought them to the staff cabin.</p><p>“Mr. Tang, we have prepared a meal for you. Mr. Kan bought it from the outside. Please enjoy it,” said an elegant and beautiful flight attendant respectfully after bringing delicious dishes to Tang Xiu and Mo Awu.</p><p>Tang Xiu raised his thumbs up and praised. “Seriously, I didn’t expect Kanaja to be this good at handling things. This guy’s wisdom really can’t be underestimated. Anyway, Kanaja seems very capable. Is he a bigshot in Bangkok?”</p><p>“We dare not judge Mr. Kan privately, Mr. Tang,” replied the flight attendant in a whisper. “But as far as I know, he is indeed very powerful. Even the owner of our airline acts very respectfully whenever he sees him.”</p><p>At 1:00 AM sharp, Tang Xiu and Mo Awu exited from Jingman Island Airport. Someone from the Everlasting Feast Hall had long been waiting for them since they had been notified in advance. The person turned out to be Chi Nan, who Tang Xiu had not seen for a while.</p><p>“Welcome back to China, Boss!”</p><p>With a bright smile on her face, Chi Nan greeted and slightly bowed.</p><p>“Eh? How come you’re the one picking us up, Chi Nan?” Tang Xiu nodded and smilingly replied.</p><p>“Well, most of our people have left Jingmen Island to our base, Boss,” answered Chi Nan with a smile. “But I need to take care of the business, so I’m not in a hurry to leave for Nine Dragons Island. I just heard about your return to China, so I volunteered to pick you up.”</p><p>Tang Xiu nodded and then said, “Anyways, let’s go back! We’ll go to the headquarters here since I have an important matter to do there.”</p><p>“What are you going to do, Boss?” asked Chi Nan curiously.</p><p>“You seem to have many issues at hand yourself, Chi Nan. But remember, don’t ask all sorts of questions from now on.” Tang Xiu looked at her and said, “Oftentimes, the more you know, the less good it will do you.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
