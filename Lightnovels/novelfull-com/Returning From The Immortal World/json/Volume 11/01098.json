It was because its location was very remote with only a few residents in the surroundings. Most of the buildings were offices and, except for a few high-rise buildings far away, the rest of them belonged to the Speeder Union’s turf. Hence, they were not concerned about exposing the incident tonight.</p><p>Most but a handful of other forces’ ears and eyes had been neutralized, so Tang Xiu didn’t bother to check around. He turned toward the Speeder Union’s HQ a few times and used the environment to determine the location to arrange the array. As he placed the jade piece in each hidden spot, he transmitted his voice to Tang An at the other side:</p><p>“When you follow me in the future, you can just ask anything about arrays directly if you encounter some problems. I can say that I’m the best in the world in this aspect.”</p><p>Tang An looked hesitant as she gritted her teeth and asked, “There’s a question I’d like to ask you then, Grand Master. What exactly is your current level of power compared to my Master? Is your attainment in arrays better than my Master?”</p><p>A strange smile appeared on Tang Xiu’s face as he replied, “Yan’er was raised by me in the past, so she is naturally weaker than me. The gap between me and I then is like a chasm even if she reaches her peak power again. In terms of arrays, however, I may not know to what extent Yan’er has achieved, but what I know is that even top-ranking Supreme level experts in the Immortal World have never been able to break my ultimate array.”</p><p>Tang An’s face slightly shifted and she asked again, “Are Supremacy Stage experts very powerful in the Immortal World, Grand Master?”</p><p>“Hahaha.” Tang Xiu couldn’t help laughing and said, “You see, even those at the Perfected Golden Immortal Stage are like babies in front of a Supreme. Each of those immortals who could reach Supremacy could be said to be the crème-de-la-crème among immortals. If the Supremacy expert is able to advance another step, which is going through ascension, he or she will enter God’s Realm.</p><p>“Gods? Do they really exist?” asked Tang An with amazement.</p><p>“Of course, deities exist. Yet, becoming a deity is far too difficult. Especially… Ah, forget it. You don’t even know about it. Shortly put. No Supreme has ascended to divinity in the Immortal World for hundreds of thousands of years already, though perhaps a certain Supreme could’ve ascended to the God’s Realm not long ago. He could’ve become a deity that countless immortals would look up to. It was a pity…”</p><p>“A pity?” Tang An pursued hastily. “Why a pity, Grand Master? Also, who is that immortal figure, exactly? To think that he’s so powerful!”</p><p>A complicated look appeared on Tang Xiu’s face as he waved and replied, “We’re straying off-topic, so let’s forget it. Anyways, just observe how I lay out the array yourself! Even if you can understand only just a thousandth of it, it will be very beneficial to you.”</p><p>Having her curiosity piqued and then got brushed off by Tang Xiu, who didn’t want to answer it, Tang An got a bit discouraged. She mulled over it in silence and decided to ask her Master about it once she got back to Nine Dragons Island. Which Supreme in the Immortal World unexpectedly was hopeful in ascending to divinity? And for what reason does Great Master feel pity for him?</p><p>The array arranged by Tang Xiu was laid slowly. It was not like he didn’t want to quickly lay out the Bloodseed Array, but it was due to the location he chose to lay it on being about 5km in radius with the Speeder’s HQ in the center. Thus, the array was very wide.</p><p>Further, he couldn’t alarm both parties currently in battle at the Speeder’s HQ, lest he made them realize, cease fighting immediately and flee in all directions. It was very likely that his wishful idea would be for naught unless he had his men to intercept the forces of both sides.</p><p>Eventually, at the moment when the battle between both sides at the Speeder’s HQ kept got more intense, Tang Xiu successfully arranged the Bloodseed Array and completed the final step of its activation.</p><p>“The array you just arranged is really too mysterious, Grand Master. I can’t notice even a minute of its essence.” Shame was cast on Tang An’s beautiful face under the bronze mask.</p><p>“Well, speaking about arrays, the more you understand, the more you find yourself shallow.” Tang Xiu chuckled and said, “If anything, I must say that my achievements in arrays have reached the apex, but I still find that many special arrays are very difficult to grasp. Just bear in mind that the array study is very vast. You’ll understand what I mean when you become an array grandmaster regarded by countless of immortals.”</p><p>Tang An nodded in response. “I’ll bear your words in mind, Grand Master.”</p><p>Tang Xiu just smiled and didn’t say anything more. As Tang An moved to the side and vanished, he quickly returned to the building where Mo Awu, Tom Reggie, and the rest were waiting. He could place the eye of the Bloodseed Array there, so the array could be easily activated at any time as long as he was in the building.</p><p>“Have you just arranged that array, Sect Master?” immediately asked Mo Awu with concern upon seeing him.</p><p>“It’s been laid out. We just need to wait for the battle between them to come to a close,” said Tang Xiu smilingly.</p><p>“The way I see it, the array you usually arrange is endlessly powerful, Sect Master.” Mo Awu hesitated before continuing, “But why didn’t you just activate it directly and use it to kill those two parties there, though?”</p><p>Mo Awu and the rest around had seen how terrifying Tang Xiu’s use of arrays as he was able to decimate tens of thousands of demonic beasts then. But there were only less than 200 enemies here, shouldn’t it be easier to kill them all?</p><p>“You know, every kind of array has a different structure and varied power.” Tang Xiu shook his head and explained. “What I just arranged was the Bloodseed Array. Its main purpose is to refine the Sanguine Pill. I can indeed annihilate them all if I arrange an aggressive type array. But then, it will cause the soul energy and life force to disperse, thus leading to much weaker effects upon refining the Sanguine Pill.”</p><p>Mu Awu understood in a flash and said in a deep voice, “Please rest assured, Sect Master. Even if you don’t intend to use the power of the array, we can still slay those enemies completely. I’ve been observing them all this time and there are only two among them who are as strong as us, whereas the rest will just be insta-killed.”</p><p>“You mustn’t underestimate anyone, got it?” Tang Xiu retorted coolly. “Those who get killed are usually the ones looking down on their enemies. You must not forget to keep your mind just like you’re in crisis when facing your enemies, even if the enemy is a newly born baby.”</p><p>“Understood!”</p><p>Mo Awu accepted the reprimand with humility upon hearing Tang Xiu’s words. His actions were then followed by the rest around, who nodded and approved.</p><p>Back to the Speeder Union’s HQ.</p><p>After the fight broke out between Iron Raven and Demonfreak, they quickly separated from the fray. It was but just a moment as these two men started their showdown, but they had exchanged hundreds of killing blows. The old Demonfreak was very powerful, yet he was a level lower than Iron Raven. He would’ve been defeated by the latter had it not been because of the python that hovered around him striking heavy damages to Iron Raven.</p><p><em>Cough, cough!</em></p><p>Iron Raven covered his chest. His clothes were torn apart by the python’s fangs, revealing mish-mashed bleeding flesh. As he coughed up a mouthful of blood, his eyes landed on the python and Demonfreak.</p><p>Bloodstains could also be seen on the corner of Demonfreak’s mouth. But he could see that Iron Raven looked much worse than him and soon would die by him and the python should this situation continue. He couldn’t help but want to laugh wildly at the moment. He had been forced to flee in distress then due to Iron Rave. It was just fortunate that he joined hands with Dao Master Poison and they were barely able to escape from their death. But now, the wheel of fortune was reversed and, somehow, he didn’t want to kill Iron Raven and wanted to torture him instead, destroying his body to put off his will. He couldn’t wait to see him turn into some dogshit, kneeling and begging for mercy.</p><p>“Iron Raven, how about leaving your commanding post of Gold-rank Assassins in the Stygian Club in exchange for me sparing your life?” Demonfreak smirked.</p><p>The man in question shook his head slowly. He wiped off the blood of his lip and let out a quaint smile. “Do you really think you can kill me today, Demonfreak? That’s some fucking dream! I may not be able to face you and your fucking monster, but you’ll find it damn difficult to kill me.”</p><p>In that instant, a firework tube appeared in his hand and a burst of flame burst on his palm and ignited the firework to explode in mid-air.</p><p>‘That’s… he’s ordering a retreat?!!’</p><p>“RETREAT!”</p><p>“LEAVE!!”</p><p>The only remaining tens of Stygian Club’s members were milking out every strength they had to force the besieging powerful enemies to draw back. Quickly, they joined together in an attempt to blaze a bloody path of escape.</p><p>A contemptuous smile was shown on Demonfreak’s face as he shouted fiercely, “Activate the Sky Origin Flag!”</p><p>In a flash, eight black-suited experts with seething killing auras bolted out from a hidden spot in the surroundings. All of them had strength at the late-stage of Foundation Establishment. As their figures flickered, eight black flags were then raised in just a few breaths.</p><p><em>Buzz…</em></p><p>A geomancy array that covered a 5km radius was formed in an instant, followed by the appearance of a dark energy shield that shrouded the entire Speeder’s HQ. The black energy shield even covered hundreds of meters high in the air while the energy in all directions crazily surged toward the eight black flags.</p><p>Only at this moment did Iron Raven got anxious. He stared in disbelief at the eight black flags and shouted aloud, “That’s the most cherished treasure of Dao Master Poison, the Sky Origin Flag! How did it appear in your hands? Did you kill him and rob his most cherished treasure?”</p><p>A sinister smile appeared on Demonfreak’s face. He gave a thumbs up and exclaimed, “That’s some fucking great deduction ability, Iron Raven. You can even think of such a ridiculous story. I, Demonfreak, have killed countless people, and the number of lives I reaped in the last two centuries is at least in the five digits. Yet, the only one who I can never slay in my life is Dao Master Poison, mind you. He not only saved my life countless times but is also my only hope to breakthrough in the future. My strength may increase and I may not like him, but he holds my hope for the future!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
