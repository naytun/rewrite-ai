He never boasted about anything if he wasn’t sure of his own abilities. He had studied the contents of arrays and fully memorized them. He had even arranged every position and every angle of the array in his head.</p><p>“Enter the array!” shouted Tang Xiu in a deep voice.</p><p>Jin Shi took a step forward, and in the next moment, he appeared in the center of the Octagonal Desolation Array. When he saw a fireball rushing toward him, his foot moved in a flash and he instantly appeared a few meters away. At the same time, his line of sight quickly changed and he found the spot he must be positioned at in just a second.</p><p>“BREAK…”</p><p>Quickly, four fireballs appeared by him, but the immortal sword that hovered around him directly broke them. He moved again and evaded another group of four fireballs before appearing at a certain position.</p><p>Suddenly, all the fireballs that were aiming at him inside the array dissipated as he stood at a safe position.</p><p>At the same time, Death Dhyana Buddhist Master’s group who was being trapped inside the Octagonal Desolation Array had a hard time avoiding the bombardment. Lightning bolts, rainstorms, hurricanes, and soil spikes came at them from time to time… it was simply countless weather changes, yet it made them badly battered and enormously consumed their cultivation power.</p><p>“We must break this fucking array formation! Otherwise, we’ll keep on being stranded inside.” The outlandish youth who controlled the black cross shouted. A wound continued to bleed on his face, and he had just barely escaped a hurricane attack.</p><p>Death Dhyana Buddhist Master himself had been observing the array since the beginning. His injury was the lightest among all and his strength hadn’t been affected that much. He was even able to help his companions while avoiding the bombardment. Yet, even after spending ten minutes observing the array, he was still unable to find the crux of the array at all.</p><p>“We only got one method left now,” said Death Dhyana Buddhist Master with a heavy voice.</p><p>“What is it, Death Dhyana?” asked the outlandish youth hurriedly, pleasantly surprised. “We have all been injured here. We won’t be able to persevere much longer if we can’t break this array quickly.”</p><p>“The only means we’ve got left is the stupidest method—using brute force,” answered Death Dhyana Buddhist Master in a deep voice. “Unleash everything you got and attack the same spot to break this fucking damn array!”</p><p>“Got it!”</p><p>“Agreed!”</p><p>The rest nodded and quickly moved closer to the Death Dhyana Buddhist Master.</p><p>The monk then pointed to one spot and said, “I can sense that this spot is the weakest point in the whole formation, yet most of the attack forms from this spot as well. We’ll need to fend off all the attacks from that direction in order to break this array, but we also must increase the intensity of our strike to create an opening there. I’m sure we can destroy this array as long as we succeed.”</p><p>“Attack, NOW!”</p><p>As Death Dhyana Buddhist Master shouted, all of them unleashed the rest of their remaining power toward the bombardment that was aiming at them. The might of the group of fireballs mixed with the lightning bolts was unquestionable, yet they were able to destroy all of them. Their residual power was also bombarding the energy shield, creating ripples on its layers which then led to thin cracks on the shield. The moment the array sent out another barrage of attack, however, the shield fluctuated and the cracks were automatically restored, while the ripples caused by the shock also disappeared.</p><p>The outlandish youth looked disappointed. However, the instant after, he keenly spotted the difference and shouted in a pleasantly surprised voice, “The array’s striking power is weakening!”</p><p>“Yeah! We didn’t break the array with the last barrage, but we’ve definitely damaged it!” Death Dhyana Buddhist Master grinned and said aloud, “That’s why it’s striking power is now weakening. Let’s keep attacking! We can overload this array with our attack, and it will forcibly be broken sooner or later!”</p><p>The monstrous burly man shouted “What are you waiting for? Keep attacki…”</p><p>Puff…</p><p>Just as he was about to finish speaking, an immortal sword that moved like a snake struck from the dark and unknowingly pierced his heart. The sword vibrated and swayed, ripping his body into pieces of meat as they exploded, creating a gruesome scene of splashing blood and flying body parts.</p><p>Jin Shi’s eyes were full of bloodlust as he appeared. He immediately stepped back after the strike and then vanished.</p><p>“What the fuck is going on?”</p><p>The scene made the faces of Death Dhyana Buddhist Master and the rest change drastically. None of them was able to spot the ambusher. They only felt a cold sensation and a wave of energy fluctuations. When they turned their heads in a hurry, they only saw the savage big man’s body explode. The bizarre situation made their complexion very ugly, while fear now bred deep inside them.</p><p>The outlandish youth with the big cross subconsciously leaned toward Death Dhyana Buddhist Master while vigilantly observing the surroundings. He didn’t even try to block the fireballs and lightning bolts that were aimed at him. At the same time, the black woman suddenly removed her cloak and swung her hand. The black cloak then formed a wall made of black mist and blocked the barrage of fireballs and lightning bolts.</p><p>“My dark coat can only fend off the strikes for half a minute. Everyone, hurry up and attack the previous spot! Otherwise, we must resist the upcoming barrage from the surroundings once it gets destroyed!” shouted the black woman.</p><p>“ATTACK AGAIN!”</p><p>Death Dhyana Buddhist Master was keenly aware of the crisis they faced at the moment. He raised his Buddhist staff without hesitation and powerfully swung it forward.</p><p>Jin Shi, who was hiding in the concealed spot and planned to keep ambushing, was suddenly a bit frustrated after the black woman used her dark coat as a shield. He hurriedly sent a voice transmission to Tang Xiu, “The enemy got a protective magic tool, Boss. I’ve got no means to keep striking them at the moment. Also, they’re attacking a certain point in the array and they will soon break the array if they keep at it.”</p><p>Coldness overflowed in Tang Xiu’s eyes as he stood outside the array. His figure flickered and instantly entered the Decagonal Desolation Array. His footsteps moved in a bizarre fashion as each step was unusually peculiar, yet his seemingly dancing figure was not affected by any attack inside the array at all. In but a moment, he appeared close to Death Dhyana Buddhist Master and his companions.</p><p>‘Interesting bunch…’</p><p>He then unleashed the divine sword. A fearsome crushing aura erupted, and the sword was enlarged by a hundred times instantly, forming a terrifying sword nearly 100m long which then smashed down toward the dark coat.</p><p>BOOM…</p><p>The dark coat was crushed to pieces. Jin Shi’s figure suddenly emerged behind the black woman and his immortal sword swept away. The female’s expression was full of horror as she was decapitated. Apart from the Buddhist monk, the rest of the group frantically scattered outside the radius of the shockwave of the divine sword.</p><p>“Tenebrous Domain!”</p><p>Singkuo, who had now recovered his power, cast his technique. Although he had been injured, it was no longer serious. But his restlessness shot through the sky upon seeing Death Dhyana Buddhist Master’s group suffer such heavy losses. His escape and a chance of survival depended on them; hence, he was forced to act as he formed a black mist to cover a large area around them.</p><p>He was also still able to observe everything inside this domain, protecting himself against enemy attacks.</p><p>“BREAK! BREAK!”</p><p>Death Dhyana Buddhist Master also rushed to the previous spot. Using his Buddhist staff, he powerfully slammed the weakest point of the formation. As a dozen cracks appeared on the shield, he threw the staff through the cracks as it cracked it open and created an opening.</p><p>“Run fast!”</p><p>The monk didn’t even spare a glance to help the rest and quickly dashed forward through the opening.</p><p>“RUN!”</p><p>“ESCAPE QUICKLY!”</p><p>The rest of them were as though seeing a chance of escaping bestowed by the Heavens. They sprinted toward the opening, including Singkuo who had just cast the Tenebrous Domain as he followed behind the Death Dhyana closely.</p><p>“You wanna run, heh? Did you ask for my permission?” chillingly shouted Tang Xiu.</p><p>The divine sword turned into countless swords yet again and overwhelmingly crushed toward the direction of the crack. In the blink of an eye, the last two vampire-like men were pierced by the overlapping sword energy and fell outside the crack.</p><p>The moment the array was broken, Tang Xiu and Jin Shi appeared next to the two dead bodies, whereas Death Dhyana Buddhist Master, Singkuo, and the outlandish youth frantically fled toward the distance.</p><p>“Guang, An, that Buddhist monk and Singkuo must die, no matter what!” Tang Xiu shouted loudly as he flashed forward to chase the trio.</p><p>“Affirmative!”</p><p>Tang Guang flashed forward extremely fast. His speed was even several times faster than Jin Shi’s. After overtaking Jin Shi, he followed behind Tang Xiu in the pursuit of the trio. However, the air in front of Tang Xiu and Tang Guang kept rippling and a faint aura could be sensed from it, just like there was another creature that smoothly traversed forward a bit faster than them.</p><p>A look of surprise flashed in Tang Xiu’s eyes as he thought inwardly: ‘Tang An’s speed should be the fastest under Chimei and Yan’er in the whole Everlasting Feast Hall. Even though I have numerous movement techniques, I’m sure she can surpass my speed with her spatial technique if her power is at the peak of the Golden Stage.’</p><p>“This heavy loss is all because I saved you, Singkuo! It’s your turn to repay us now. Stay here and stop them. As long as you don’t die this time, I swear you’ll be our brother later!” Death Dhyana Buddhist Master’s heart thumped harder and faster. He could sense the vague and faint fluctuations that quickly approached them, so he guessed that it was the mysterious female assassin they encountered before.</p><p>Singkuo’s face enormously changed. He didn’t expect that Death Dhyana Buddhist Master would actually make such a request at this time. It was obvious that staying here to stop Tang Xiu and his men only meant one thing: his death.</p><p>But… he can’t die here!</p><p>Even if he must offend Death Dhyana Buddhist Master and would need his antidote six months later, he just couldn’t stay here and die. The world was so vast, and he could find a place to hide if he could escape and survive here. Certainly, he could also return to the Dark Shaman Clan as a last resort if worse came to worst. He believed that his father wouldn’t sit still and watch him be killed by Tang Xiu and Singluen.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
