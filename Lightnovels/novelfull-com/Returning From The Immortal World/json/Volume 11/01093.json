The man’s power and influence in Saipan were originally mediocre at best; he couldn’t even enter the top three among the underground forces of Saipan. He could be said to enter the stage by taking the opportunity of Song Guanghui’s rise to power and then annexed several small forces to expand his power greatly.</p><p>“Give me three days!” Tang Xiu raised three fingers and said, “In three days, Tom will become the Overlord and gain full control of the life and death of Saipan’s underground forces. Uncle Song, you’ve become the most powerful official, so you’ll be in the light, yet someone from our side must also control the underground forces here.”</p><p>His declaration made Song Guanghui shocked, but he hesitantly said, “I’m not skeptical about your strength, Tang Xiu, but isn’t three days way too short? The three strongest underground forces in Saipan are all inextricably linked with some underground forces in other countries. In particular, the Ravengale Chamber, which I heard is deeply related to the Stygian Club. It’s very likely that this organization is one of the Stygian Club’s divisions.”</p><p>Ravengale Chamber?</p><p>Tang Xiu narrowed his eyes and smilingly said, “Uncle Song, even if the Ravengale Chamber is the Stygian Club’s HQ, I can still destroy it completely if I want to, albeit paying a price. Please rest your worry! I’ve never acted without preparing enough armaments. But before we go into action, we will investigate this Ravengale Chamber first.”</p><p>Song Guanghui nodded wordlessly. Then, he spoke, “As long as you can get rid of the Ravengale Chamber, the Golden Cauldron and the Speeder Union won’t pose any significant threat. Ah, no! Do pay attention to Jameson, the leader of Speeder Union. He’s a ruthless and powerful character, and rumors have it that he’s closely related to many drug lords and arms dealers.”</p><p>“Yeah, I heard about this Speeder Union from Awu too.” Tang Xiu nodded and said, “But there’s no need to fear them if we got absolute strength, though.”</p><p>Recalling Tang Xiu’s identity, Song Guanghui immediately stopped mentioning this topic. He chatted with him about some other things before secretly leaving Lao Bay Resort.</p><p>Late at night, Tang Xiu received a phone call from Tom Reggie and got two important news. At this moment, the Speeder Union’s HQ was under attack by many experts from Ravengale Chamber and was said to be in a desperate struggle. The other news said that a group of mysterious people had come to the Golden Cauldron from other countries about half an hour ago.</p><p>“The tide has begun surging in the dark!”</p><p>When Tang Xiu hung up the phone and floated out of the villa’s door, a few figures silently appeared behind him.</p><p>“Two parties are in conflict while the third one will come to fish the benefits. So, if my guess is correct, tonight will be the harvest time for us. Get ready, guys! Keep in touch with Tom’s men since we’re going to stir up the waters of the underground forces in Saipan.”</p><p>“Why would you choose such troublesome means, Grand Master?” asked Tang Guang smilingly. “Let’s just strike them directly and destroy the other underground forces here.”</p><p>Tang Xiu glanced at him and vaguely said, “Having confidence is a good thing, but you must never underestimate anyone. We don’t know much about Saipan’s underground forces or any relations they may have with the huge organizations of other countries. We don’t even know how powerful the enemies we’re about to face are, either. That’s why it’s necessary to figure out our enemy’s strength before we move out. Even though it’s impossible to clarify everything precisely, it’s still necessary to know some things about them.”</p><p>The smile on Tang Guang’s face receded. A short while after, he said with an embarrassed face, “I saw myself too highly, Grand Master.”</p><p>“You’re still young, so your thoughts and style are still immature.” Tang Xiu smiled and said, “But you’ll be able to analyze more issues after you have more experience in the future, though.”</p><p>‘Uh… I’m still young?’</p><p>Tang Guang stared at Tang Xiu with a bizarre expression. A similar expression could also be seen on Mo Awu and the rest. They looked at Tang Xiu’s appearance, who was still in his early 20s. They couldn’t help but murmur to themselves inwardly.</p><p>Screech…</p><p>Four black SUVs stopped in front of the villa and the driver from the forefront car opened the door. He strode toward Tang Xiu and respectfully said, “Mr. Tang, Boss told us to pick you up.”</p><p>“Alright, let’s head there as fast as you can,” said Tang Xiu.</p><p>“Understood!”</p><p>After everyone boarded the cars, the four black SUVs quickly left the Lao Bay Resort. However, in a hotel a few hundred meters away from them, a bald man received a report from his subordinate and immediately left with four burly men. After the four black SUVs had just left the gate of Lao Bay Resort, several Hummers vroomed to pursue them shortly after.</p><p>“Speed up!”</p><p>In one of the Hummers, the bald man clicked his lips and a cold light flashed in his eyes as he issued an order aloud.</p><p>The burly man driving the Hummer stepped on the accelerator deeper and asked, “Are you sure those people ahead are heading toward the Speeder Union’s HQ, Boss? Tom Reggie’s movements have been quite big recently, and he has annihilated some forces. Could it be that he dares to hit our Speeder Union after we’ve suffered some losses from the siege?”</p><p>“Heh, Tom Reggie is an ambitious guy. He even betrayed his former employer.” The bald man sneered and said, “He has been in cahoots with someone in power recently, so there’s nothing this man can’t do. If anything, we just need to keep tabs on this bastard closely. So long as those cars head toward the direction of our Speeder Union’s HQ, we can still report to the Big Boss once they get near the BMS Building.”</p><p>A few minutes after, the four SUVs gradually slowed down, partly due to the traffic congestion on the road ahead and also because they found they had some people tailing them.</p><p>“We got some company 90 meters behind, Grand Master.” Tang Guang, who used to be good at using sniper rifles, reported in a whisper after spotting several cars behind them.</p><p>Tang Xiu let out a smile and took out three silver needles from his interspatial ring. Using his mental power, he flicked the needless through the slit in the window and shot it fast towards the tailing Hummers behind.</p><p>BUMP! BUMP! BUMP!</p><p>The three silver needles accurately shot the front wheels of the three Hummers, causing them to crash toward the roadside as the tires burst. In that instant, Tang Guang and Mo Awu bolted out of the cars, leaving only afterimages. Without anyone noticing, they dashed toward the accident scene.</p><p>“Stop and park ahead!”</p><p>After issuing the order, Tang Xiu slowly shut his eyes.</p><p>As of now, various people were gathering in Saipan, and the tide of the storm was brewing underneath. He wasn’t sure which side the people tracking him belonged to. Nevertheless, he was rather glad about this mess since only then could he fish in troubled waters, gaining benefits and achieving his own goals.</p><p>Behind them, Tang Guang and Mo Awu appeared by the three Hummers lightning-fast. They quickly launched a barrage of punches to the heads of those who came out of the car and directly knocked them out under the cover of the three cars. Tang Guang then grabbed a burly man by the neck and quickly disappeared with him.</p><p>In a remote spot nearby, Mo Awu slapped the face of the big man. As the latter sobered up, a dagger was placed on his neck and Mo Awu began interrogating him in a heavy voice with a face full of killing intent. “Tell me, which side do you belong to and why are you tailing us?”</p><p>The dizzy burly man raised his head and felt a chilling sensation on his neck. When he saw the seething killing intent in Mo Awu’s eyes, a chill overrun his whole being and fear enveloped his heart. He was no stranger with those eyes since he had also killed people and had contact with numerous outlaws. Such eyes only belonged to ruthless killers.</p><p>At this moment in time, he felt as though the angel of death had come to greet him. Although he thought that he’d never fear death in the past, he couldn’t help but feel despair facing such a hopeless situation himself. His lips squirmed a few times before he answered, “W-we are the Ravengale.”</p><p>“Heh, the Ravengale should be attacking the Speeder Union’s HQ now. What the hell are you tracking us for?” asked Mo Awu once again. “Are you telling me you’re going to get rid of Tom Reggie after removing the Speeder Club?”</p><p>The burly men stared blankly and asked in surprise, “Huh? You guys are not Tom Reggie’s men?”</p><p>” <em>Hmph</em> , like hell we are.” Mo Awu sneered.</p><p>“Then it’s our mistake, it seems.” The burly man helplessly said, “We were just tracking Tom Reggie’s cars, but we know nothing about the people who boarded them. In actuality, we got no plan to get rid of Tom Reggie since he’s very closely related to some great figures in Jingmen Island. The only concern my Big Boss has is that Tom Reggie will take his men to trouble us when we’re attacking the Speeder Union.”</p><p>Mo Awu nodded in response and stunned the fella again with a punch. Then, he quickly returned to the car with Tang Guang and reported the situation to Tang Xiu. “We didn’t silence them and just stunned them all.”</p><p>“That’s fine. They’re nothing but small fries, to begin with.” Tang Xiu nodded and issued an order. “Let’s set off again and rush to the Speeder Union’s HQ! I wanna see how big the price the Ravengale must pay to annihilate the Speeder Union.”</p><p>Twenty minutes later, Tang Xiu met Tom Reggie in a building near the Speeder Union’s HQ. This guy’s expression at the moment was splendid, and he seemed happy as he reported. “The Speeder Union got some heavy weapons. Even though the Ravengale has excellent first-class snipers and powerful assaulters aside from those demi-human experts to storm them over, they are still unable to breach the Speeder Union’s final defense line. Also, the Speeder Union got some powerful characters, Boss. But they are… not human…”</p><p>Tang Xiu took the binoculars handed over to him and went to the windows to observe. Then, he asked, “What kind of demi-humans can make you this shocked, though?”</p><p>“Uh, they’re like superhuman and very powerful, Boss,” said Tom Reggie with a wry smile. “I just saw a sniper bullet hit one of those guys’ heart, but he just got injured by it. The bullet just couldn’t kill him. He even counterattacked directly and killed some experts of Ravengale.”</p><p>Superhuman?</p><p>Tang Xiu kept observing with the binoculars and soon spotted some figures flickering about in the final line of defense of the Speeder Union. They were using firearms to counterattack and even used hidden weapons or cold weapons to kill their enemies.</p><p>They must be Genetic Warriors!</p><p>He kept observing for some time and immediately recognized the situation and identity of those people due to the level of strength they were displaying. Among them were a few with hairy bodies and looking like humanoid beasts.</p><p>“What about the losses of each side, Tom?” asked Tang Xiu while observing.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
