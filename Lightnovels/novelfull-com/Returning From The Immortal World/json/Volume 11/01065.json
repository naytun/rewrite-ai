At the time Hao Lei and tens of juniors from the Tang Sect were doing everything they could to fight more than a dozen demonic beasts, Mo Awu brought two more comrades and joined the fray, much to Hao Lei’s team’s happy surprise.</p><p>“Hao Lei, Sect Master is being chased by hundreds of bird-species demonic beasts and will soon be here. We must join forces to decimate these demonic beasts within a minute, else Sect Master’s plan will be affected,” Mo Awu shouted while moving like a lightning bolt and slashed his immortal sword at a demonic beast. As the beast tried to avoid him, the two joined forces and killed it.</p><p>Hao Lei’s complexion changed and he hurriedly shouted back, “Did you tell Sect Master about our situation here, Mo Awu? If Sect Master brings those hundreds of bird-species demonic beasts here, wouldn’t it be very difficult for everyone to escape?”</p><p>Continuing his onslaught despite his injuries, Mo Awu kept moving to attack other demonic beasts with boiling killing aura. He replied loudly, “The main reason is that Sect Master will be arranging an array here. You all know his accomplishment in that aspect, so no worries about that. However, we still need to exterminate these demonic beasts first and then help him defend against those hundreds of bird-species demonic beasts. We’ll be done for if the rest of horde comes over.”</p><p>Upon hearing that Tang Xiu was going to arrange an array in this place, Hao Lei immediately relaxed. However, after hearing Mo Awu’s words, she grew restless again and asked loudly, “You mean, except for those hundreds of birds, there are still other demonic beasts chasing him?”</p><p>“Thousands more!” replied Mo Awu curtly.</p><p>Hiss…</p><p>Upon hearing this, be it Hao Lei or the tens of Tang Sect disciples, they couldn’t help but gasp. Thousands of demonic beasts? If so many demonic beasts caught up with them, wouldn’t it be very difficult to completely exterminate them even if Sect Master arranged the array here?</p><p>We’re still gonna die. Hao Lei couldn’t help but sigh inwardly. Then, she loudly shouted, “Everyone, heed my order! We mustn’t affect Sect Master’s plan. We must ensure that Sect Master can arrange the array here even if we all die. Kill all these damned demonic beasts even if we perish with them!!!”</p><p>“KILL!”</p><p>“KILL THEM ALL!!”</p><p>More than 20 disciples of the Tang Sect fell into madness, and frantic killing intent overflowed in their eyes. At the moment their eyes turned bloodshot, their momentum and striking power increased rapidly. Some of them, who had experienced numerous fierce battles, even had their potential stimulated further at this time, and broke through to a new realm, causing their True Essence energy to crazily surge inside their bodies.</p><p>“DIE!”</p><p>Eyes bloodshot and blood vessels on her arm squirming, Hao Lei’s True Essence wildly surged in her meridians and broke through the previously clogged acupoints. As the new meridians connected, she, who was previously at the late-stage of Foundation Establishment, directly broke through to the Golden Core Stage. The world energy in the surroundings crazily surged towards her from everywhere and rushed into her Dantian, finally forming a sesame-sized Golden Core.</p><p>Dangerous!</p><p>Of the dozen demonic beasts, there was only one of them at the Golden Core Stage, causing the rest to look horrified. They could sense that particular human’s momentum skyrocketed unceasingly, while the flow of energy frantically surged towards her. Such a phenomenon occurred when their kind had a breakthrough.</p><p>Escape.</p><p>The only Golden Core demonic beast was highly more intelligent than the rest. After struggling for a moment, it immediately gave up attacking the other humans and attempted its best to force back several humans who joined forces to defend before frantically bolting away.</p><p>Puff! Puff! Puff!</p><p>The blood splattered in full bloom as Hao Lei, who just broke through to the Golden Core Stage, killed various demonic beasts. The other Tang Sect disciples also fell into a frenzy in their onslaught and killed the rest in just half a minute.</p><p>Far away from them, a figure flickered towards them with hundreds of demonic beasts hot on his heels.</p><p>Tang Xiu’s speed was extremely fast. When he sensed a very strong aura from a demonic beast dashing from the direction he was heading to, he quickly manipulated the flying sword without hesitation and slashed it forward.</p><p>Puff…</p><p>Adding the might of the divine sword, Tang Xiu’s strength was on par with a Nascent Soul Stage expert as he struck a heavy blow to the only Golden Core demonic beast. At the same time, he flicked his fingers and shot two silver needles and precisely hit its eyes.</p><p>ROAAAAR….</p><p>Hollow wails came from the demonic beast, only to be met with Tang Xiu’s sneer. His figure slightly flickered and his divine sword erupted its might yet again as its sharp blade pierced the beast directly. An instant after, the divine sword hovered in a curved trajectory and beheaded its head. Tang Xiu then pulled its corpse into the interspatial ring in the blink of an eye.</p><p>“Casualty report?!” asked Tang Xiu aloud as he dashed towards Hao Lei’s team.</p><p>“18 seriously injured and some have lost their combat power, Sect Master,” replied Hao Lei in a shout. “The rest can still fight, but their combat effectiveness is affected!”</p><p>“Obstruct those bird-species demonic beasts to buy me some time,” ordered Tang Xiu with a deep voice. “I need to arrange the array here. Those beasts will cause great casualties if we can’t trap them here. The defense line around the mountain range will be greatly impacted. It’s possible that it can be breached, and thousands of demonic beasts could be unleashed on the outside world.”</p><p>“Understood!”</p><p>Hao Lei only replied curtly since the sesame-sized Golden Core in her Dantian had nearly absorbed all the True Essence inside her meridians, whereas the world energy from the surrounding was still rushing into her system and fusing into the Golden Core after the refinement.</p><p>Tang Xiu discovered Hao Lei’s condition at this moment. He didn’t expect that Hao Lei, who normally didn’t stand out, would be the first person to advance to the Golden Core Stage after Gu Xiaoxue, Gu Yin, Tang Guang, and Tang An. Although he knew that her cultivation speed was remarkably fast, breaking through at this time was, nonetheless, still too fast.</p><p>“Array… form!”</p><p>At this time, however, he didn’t have the leisure to split his focus. He took out a jade stone from his interspatial ring while instantly unleashing his spiritual sense to cover an area of hundreds of meters. His figure then kept moving and quickly drew a large area of nearly a kilometer in diameter.</p><p>Shoo! Shoo! Shoo!</p><p>A piece of jade stone was thrown to its respective point. At the same time, he kept releasing his Primal Chaos Force and quickly drew the pattern of the array.</p><p>Meanwhile, Mo Awu, Hao Lei, and more than 20 disciples of Tang Sect had all unleashed their immortal and magic swords to fight hundreds of bird-species demonic beasts. Due to the presence of two Golden Core demonic beasts and hundreds of others in the horde, they were quickly falling under pressure.</p><p>However, since they also trained in sword formation with more than 20 people collaborating, they formed two sword arrays to fend off these bird-species demonic beasts, so none of them would die in a short time.</p><p>Quick! Quick! Quick!</p><p>The more critical the situation, the calmer Tang Xiu was. Racing against time made him fall into a particular state of calmness as he drew the array pattern.</p><p>Time quickly passed by as he drew the cumbersome pattern. A few minutes after, the shadows of thousands of demonic beasts loomed on the distant peaks. Dozens of demonic beasts on par with experts at Golden Core Stage had especially crossed through the mountaintop and galloped down to the valley.</p><p>Puff…</p><p>A Tang Sect disciple was hit by a bird demonic beast. His chest was ripped, leaving a bleeding wound on it, while his body was thrown backward. His absence made a gap in the sword formation and two Foundation Establishment Stage demonic beast seized the chance to strike two more disciples and send them flying.</p><p>“Activate!”</p><p>Finally, Tang Xiu activated the geomancy array that covered the area of nearly a kilometer in diameter. The array had both a trapping effect and fierce striking power. Tang Xiu was confident that they could keep harvesting demonic beasts’ lives once a large number of them were lured into the formation.</p><p>As he turned around and saw the Tang Sect disciples who were under the onslaught of hundreds of bird-species demonic beasts, he fiercely shouted an order, “All of you, retreat and follow me into the array!”</p><p>In a flash, ecstatic looks appeared on the faces of Tang Sect disciples who were struggling to fight back. The seriously injured disciples quickly fell back to Tang Xiu while more than 20 others who were fending off the demonic beasts dashed lightning-fast in the same direction.</p><p>“Enter the array!” shouted Tang Xiu.</p><p>In just less than 10 seconds, tens of Tang Sect disciples had entered the array and quickly moved to positions in the formation under Tang Xiu’s instructions.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>A group of bird demonic beasts quickly rushed into the range covered by the array. But right, after they entered the big array, they found that the world in front of them had suddenly changed with the overwhelming flames that covered the sky and shrouded over them.</p><p>ROAAAR…</p><p>GRUMBLE…</p><p>HOU, HOU…</p><p>Every bird demonic beast that entered the array was struck with maximum fear. The flame was dreadful to them, especially one with such high temperature that made them feel the threat of death. However, no matter how hard they tried to avoid it and spit out their demonic flame, they failed to extinguish these flames.</p><p>A few of them that could devour, however, looked wild with joy and opened their beaks wide to swallow the flames, only to howl and wail a few seconds after. Their bodies combusted, leaving only their Demon Cores on the ground.</p><p>“True Flame; Thunderbolt; Lightning Grid; Hurricane!”</p><p>Tang Xiu placed tens of Tang Sect disciples in a safe area and immediately controlled the array as he began attacking the hundreds of bird-species demonic beasts. Flames emerged out of thin air and burned demonic beasts, thunderclaps bolted down and made them dizzy, while lightning bolts burst into the grids, trapping these demonic beasts one after another, while the hurricane tore them apart and caused them to fall one after another.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
