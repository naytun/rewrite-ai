A quaint expression was suddenly cast on his face. “I remember… aren’t you Lulu’s…”</p><p>Tang Xiu continued his words with a dry smile, “Yeah, I’m Lulu’s boyfriend. Anyways… Secretary Li… I didn’t know that you were her uncle before, so I got… well, a bit overboard. Please don’t mind. Cough, cough…”</p><p>Li Daoren touched his nose, at a loss whether he had to cry or laugh. He knew who Tang Xiu was. Be it his famous reputation as a miracle-working doctor in Chinese traditional medicine or from his niece, Ouyang Lulu. It was just due to the prior incidents that Tang Xiu’s identity didn’t come to his mind. Now that he learned about it, it did feel really… awkward, to think that he got lectured by his junior.</p><p>However, Tang Xiu’s identity as a member of the Security Department was nevertheless still a shocking fact to him. “I had no idea, either. I’ve been wanting to meet Lulu’s boyfriend, yet I never thought that I’d meet him like this. Anyway, Lei, why did you come here in the middle of the night, though?”</p><p>“It’s about the treasure our family got recently, Uncle,” replied Ouyang Lei with a smile. “I brought it here for Tang Xiu to have a look, so we agreed to meet here an hour ago. But I didn’t expect that such incident happened here either.”</p><p>“I see. Then I won’t ask any more about the things between you two.” Li Daoren nodded and said, “Well, Tang Xiu, you’re Lulu’s boyfriend, so we’re relatives. But remember to bring her to visit me later, got it? And give my regards to Senior Tang too.”</p><p>“Ehh?” Tang Xiu nodded and asked curiously asked, “Do you know my grandfather?”</p><p>“Yeah. My father used to be Senior Tang’s bodyguard. But he retired after he got injured and has been living in Jingmen Island since. I met Senior Tang with my father about 20 years ago.”</p><p>Tang Xiu instantly understood and felt much closer to Li Daoren as he smilingly said, “Well, I’ll follow Lulu and call you uncle as well, then. I’ll definitely pass your regards to my grandfather.”</p><p>Li Daoren happily nodded and smilingly said, “It’s truly a blessing for Lulu to have a talented young man such as you as her boyfriend. But make sure to treat her well in the future, or I forbid you to call me uncle.”</p><p>“Sure!” replied Tang Xiu smilingly.</p><p>Just like their fast arrival, Li Daoren and the people from the police department left very quickly. In just ten minutes, they had taken away Guo Fugui and his men, leaving only the smell of blood wafting in the air. Due to Tang Xiu’s identity, only Gu Xiaoxue dealt with the police tape, so the fate Guo Fugui ended up with later had nothing to do with Tang Xiu anymore.</p><p>However, Tang Xiu thought that he should find some time to visit the Patriarch of the Huang Family of the Fukang Province, Huang Jinfu, since Guo Fugui and the Huangs seemed a bit related.</p><p>Shortly after, Tang Xiu and Ouyang Lei came to a spacious room in the restaurant under Gu Xiaoxue’s leadership. She then took a seat silently after serving the two men tea.</p><p>Ouyang Lei glanced at Gu Xiaoxue and forced a smile. “You know, if I didn’t have a girlfriend already, I’d have lost my mind sitting in front of you, Ms. Gu. I’ve seen tons of belles, but I can’t seem to pick one all over the world who can compare to you.”</p><p>“Are you saying I’m much prettier than your little sis Lulu, Ouyang Lei?” replied Gu Xiaoxue with a faint smile.</p><p>Ouyang Lei looked black for a second before letting out a hollow chuckle.</p><p>“Let’s not waste time dilly-dallying, Brother Lei,” said Tang Xiu. “Show me the treasure. You really got my curiosity piqued. What exactly is it?”</p><p>Ouyang Lei nodded, lifted up a lock combination suitcase and placed it on the coffee table. After entering several number combinations, the suitcase was then opened.</p><p>“This is the treasure my family has found, Tang Xiu. No one among archeologists, historians, and even famous collectors in China knows what this thing is. Take a look at it. It would be great if you can identify it.”</p><p>A look of intense disbelief covered Tang Xiu’s face upon seeing the oval object in the suitcase. It was an object he never dreamed that he would see it again in this life.</p><p>“How did you get this thing?” Asked Tang Xiu after barely being able to raise his head.</p><p>Ouyang Lei’s face shifted. He didn’t rush answering Tang Xiu and asked back instead, “Do you know what this is?”</p><p>Tang Xiu’s expression was a bit ugly and his eyes looked a bit hazy. Yet, that haziness brought out a vague painful feeling as he replied in a low voice, “No one knows about this object better than me in this world. No one.”</p><p>His response made Ouyang Lei realize Tang Xiu’s unusualness. Despite the eagerness to find out about the object, he said, “A distant uncle of the Ouyangs sent his men to an overseas island to catch some fierce beasts recently. It was to prepare to make wine with the beast’s viscera soaked in it. Eventually, they killed a beast and brought its body back and found this thing after dissecting it.”</p><p>The object was found in the fierce beast’s body?</p><p>Tang Xiu slowly closed his eyes. He thought that it was indeed the only possibility for this object to not be eroded, as it would otherwise scatter if it were to be exposed to the air for several years.</p><p>After a while, Tang Xiu opened his eyes. His fingers trembled a bit as he gently picked up the oval object and held it. There was a pained expression as he quietly caressed it for a long time. “I just said that no one knows about this better than I do in this world. It’s because I refined this object myself.”</p><p>“What do you mean?” Ouyang Lei was surprised and pursued. “You were the one who manufactured this thing?”</p><p>Tang Xiu shook his head. “Give me this thing, Brother Lei. I’m willing to exchange it with anything your family needs.”</p><p>“Say what?” Ouyang Lei was shocked by Tang Xiu’s words, difficulty betraying his face.</p><p>“I refined this object, so this thing belongs to me. It’s indeed a treasure in my hand, but useless for others. There are only two people in this world who can open it,” explained Tang Xiu.</p><p>“In can be opened?!” Ouyang Lei stared dazedly and looked confused. “What do you mean by that? Does this thing has space inside, like there’s something stored inside?”</p><p>Tang Xiu didn’t answer any of his questions and bit his finger. He forced a drop of blood of his and drew a quaint rune with his blood on the oval object. In that instant, the ancient rune turned into tiny stars of blood that constantly spread out on the oval object.</p><p>Crack…</p><p>The object was opened and a glittering white pearl appeared in front of Tang Xiu, Ouyang Lei, and Gu Xiaoxue.</p><p>There was a complicated look on Tang Xiu’s face as he picked up an egg-sized white pearl while muttering to himself, “An oath of eternal love that was made for two trees that tied for eternity in the previous life; for the everlasting union of your heart and mine that would last until the end of our lives. Yet now it feels so ridiculous, leaving only the most painful feeling of betrayal…”</p><p>Buzz…</p><p>A brilliant glow emanated from the white pearl in his hand and gradually dissipated in just a few seconds. A little fairy appeared in front of Tang Xiu flapping her wings, her eyes staring wide with curiosity as she looked around. As her eyes fell on Tang Xiu, she blinked and asked, “W-who are you? Why do I feel that you’re so familiar? Ah, Master… where’s my Master? She hasn’t summoned Little Wu out for a very long time.”</p><p>Tang Xiu inhaled a deep breath. A murderous intention arose in him as he snapped. “SHUT UP!!!”</p><p>The little fairy trembled a bit and looked frightened. After flying out from Tang Xiu’s palm and standing in the air five-plus meters away, she said, “Y-you scolded Little Wuwu… Little Wuwu wants to scold you back…. B-but why can’t Little Wuwu lash out at you? Who are you? Why does Wuwu feel familiar with you? You feel so familiar, but Wuwu has never seen you.”</p><p>“I told you to shut up!” said Tang Xiu fiercely. “If you dare to say a word, I’ll use the Nine Lotus Karmic Flame to burn you to ashes.”</p><p>“Ah…”</p><p>The little fairy looked horrified and flew to the wall in the distance, wings flapping yet trembling. She just suspended there with eyes staring wide, afraid of uttering any sounds. She recalled that no one but her Master’s outstanding husband, the Supreme Tang Xiu, was able to unleash the Nine Lotus Karmic Flame.</p><p>It was no wonder that she felt that his aura was so awfully familiar. It turned out that he was her Master’s husband, just that his appearance was different.</p><p>The little fairy was anxious to ask where her Master was, but she could only look at Tang Xiu without saying a word after seeing the boiling murderous intent on his face. He also threatened her to not utter any more words just now.</p><p>Tang Xiu took another deep breath. He then looked at Ouyang Lei and said, “Brother Lei, forgive me since it’s inconvenient to tell you about it. I have a deep relationship with her Master. I was also the one who refined her container. Give it to me and you can ask for any compensation you want.”</p><p>Ouyang Lei stood dumbly after witnessing the appearance of the little fairy. He would probably stay in a daze for a very long time if not for Tang Xiu’s words pulling him back to reality.</p><p>“I…” He gulped down and looked a bit lost.</p><p>Tang Xiu was silent for a while, then suddenly said, “I’ll give you an immortal tool. The real one with infinite power that’s definitely the divine armament for cultivators.”</p><p>An immortal weapon?</p><p>Ouyang Lei shot a look at the little fairy and thought about the immortal weapon. He immediately slapped his thigh and exclaimed, “It’s a deal. I’ll take responsibility!”</p><p>Tang Xiu turned to Gu Xiaoxue and said, “Remember to take an immortal sword from Ji Chimei and deliver it to the Ouyangs. Also, teach them the technique to manipulate the immortal sword.”</p><p>Gu Xiaoxue was likewise in shock at the moment. But as a cultivator at the Golden Core Stage, she had a firmer mind than Ouyang Lei, so she calmly nodded and said, “I’ll ask Elder Ji for an immortal sword when I see her later.”</p><p>Tang Xiu then shifted to the confused-looking little fairy. His fingers moved and made a seal. A stream of qi wrapped the fairy and pulled her into the oval container.</p><p>“Don’t shut Little Wuwu, please. Wuwu doesn’t want to stay inside anymore.” The fairy frantically screamed, “Please, let Wuwu out. Wuwu wants to see Master. Sob, sob… Wuwu misses Master.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
