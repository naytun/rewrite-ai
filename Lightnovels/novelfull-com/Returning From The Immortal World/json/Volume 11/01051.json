If you’re free, can you help me to take care of someone? I feel a bit uneasy giving her to that Tang Wei fella.”</p><p>“Ehh?” Mu Wanying was confused and asked, “Who’s this person, though?”</p><p>“Well, she’s kinda the essence of disaster,” said Tang Xiu with a helpless face. “She’s a Star City’s local. That girl did a live broadcast when I gave treatment at the Star City Chinese Medical Hospital, exposing my face to the public. I became acquainted with her after I asked for her help to broadcast the situation with the Star City Welfare House then. Ultimately, this girl just stirred up troubles. You have heard about the major cases occurred in the capital in the last two days, right?”</p><p>Mu Wanying blinked and immediately said smilingly, “Ah, I know who she is. Isn’t she that cute anchor, Mengmeng?”</p><p>“Sure enough. You also watched that live broadcast.” Tang Xiu forced a wry smile and said, “That’s right, that’s the work of this epitome of disaster maker. I really never thought that she dared to broadcast this case until those evil guys had been dealt with. It was already too late when I found her doing it, so after she was taken away by the Security Department, I went over to take her out. But well, she probably got frightened too much and don’t want to go back to Star City by herself and insisted to came with me, hence why I took her here.”</p><p>“Ah… so it was a hero saving a damsel in distress then,” commented Mu Wanying with an odd expression. “Did she fall for you perchance?”</p><p>“I would be a God if I had such a great charm, you know,” shot Tang Xiu back smilingly. “Anyways, she’s very young and has a pure mind. I just met her a few times, so anything like falling for me is out of the question. I would’ve driven her back to Star City if it wasn’t for the fact that she has helped me with the Welfare House issue in Star City.”</p><p>Mu Wanying just chuckled in response and said, “Well, where’s she then? I’m going to look for her.”</p><p>“I’ll take you to her! She’s with Tang Wei,” said Tang Xiu.</p><p>At the other pavilion.</p><p>Looking anxious and restless, Tian Xiaomeng closely followed Tang Wei, looking somewhat like a panda being watched by the crowd. Although she was of similar age with some of the males and females in the surroundings, with some being older or younger than her, she almost had the impulse to run away after looking at the unusual bearing possessed by these young ladies and scions.</p><p>Furthermore, after she had a brief exchange with Tang Wei, she finally learned one thing—Tang Xiu’s grandfather was Tang Guosheng, the former national figure, a real big figure in the truest sense. Even Tang Xiu’s uncles who were not high-ranking officials were also top brasses in the military, much to her incessant restlessness.</p><p>However, she also realized that she didn’t have any repelling feeling after learning Tang Xiu’s real identity whatsoever. Rather, she worshipped him more. She had been having erroneous assumptions that all those scions, offspring of official as well as the second generation of the haves were just a bunch of silk pants, who had no real abilities and nothing but finely looking cases but were empty inside. But Tang Xiu… he was worlds apart from them. He had extreme expertise in Chinese medicine and could be compared to Bian Que and Hua Tuo, the Divine Doctors in ancient times. Further, he also found the Magnificent Tang Corporation, such a super company by himself.</p><p>“Did Young Master Tang Xiu bring you here?” a girl in a long gown with an attractive chignon hairdo asked with rounded eyes.</p><p>Although being very nervous, Tian Xiaomeng nodded and said, “Yeah, Tang Xiu brought me here.”</p><p>The girl looked a bit envious and said, “I really didn’t expect that Tang Xiu would bring you here. But I heard that his fiancée is Mu Wanying, though! How come…”</p><p>Tang Wei stared at her and interjected. “Spare the nonsense, will you? Mu Wanying is indeed Tang Xiu’s girlfriend, and this Xiaomeng is his friend—a good friend. You’d better not be that mindful over this, girls! No matter what the means and how wishful you are to pursue my good brother, I firmly believe that there’s no unmovable wall in the world and no unhookable boyfriend for you all.”</p><p>“Are you looking for a beating, Brat?” Tang Ying raised her fist and menacingly smiled. “Wanying is my bosom friend, yet you dare to instigate everyone to seduce her boyfriend? Just wait until I tell Wanying everything you just said, so she’ll remember you every time you see her.”</p><p>“Ugh… no-no-no. Don’t!” With a begging-for-mercy face, Tang Wei cupped his fists and pleaded. “Please forget what I just said, Big Sis! If after some time Wanying really marries Tang Xiu, then she’ll become my sis-in-law, the true one. I’ll be damned and eat bitter fruits if she remembers it then!”</p><p>After listening to Tang Wei and Tang Ying’s dialogs, Tian Xiaomeng curiously said, “You said Tang Xiu already has a girlfriend? Is his girlfriend very outstanding?”</p><p>In a flash, tens of young men and women present all stared at Tian Xiaomeng. The whole place turned silent as their eyes landed at Tian Xiaomeng like they were seeing a monster.</p><p>Outstanding… meaning?</p><p>They were all scions of notable and prominent families. Each and every one of them thought highly of themselves for being excellent and whatnot. And yet, comparing themselves with Mu Wanying, the latter was definitely more excellent than them! Be it her education, appearance, stature, and bearings, to hail Mu Wanying as a woman who deserved the First Belle of Beijing title was not an understatement.</p><p>Tian Xiaomeng’s eyes went wide as she muttered with a confused expression, “Did I say something wrong? Tang Xiu is a very outstanding man to me! He’s much better than any young man, but no girl is worthy of him if she’s not as excellent as him.”</p><p>“Xiaomeng, then, do you think you’re worthy to be with Tang Xiu?” asked Tang Wei with a strange smirk.</p><p>Suddenly, everyone else also wore strange smiles.</p><p>Without even thinking, Tian Xiaomeng shook her head. “I never thought I’m worthy enough to be with him. Tang Xiu is just like the sun, whereas I’m like a star in the sky. How can the speck of starlight match the brilliance of the sun? How can I be worthy of him?”</p><p>“Aah…”</p><p>Everyone around inhaled a long breath of relief. They previously thought that this girl wasn’t able to measure herself well!</p><p>Tian Xiaomeng’s pure and simple bearing was much to Tang Ying’s liking. She paced forward and pulled her hands, saying, “You’re my little brother, Tang Xiu’s friend, Xiaomeng, so you’re Tang Ying’s friend too. Just tell me whoever dares to bully you, Sis Ying will definitely make them pay you back!”</p><p>Tian Xiaomeng already knew Tang Ying’s identity now and felt very flattered. She didn’t expect that Tang Ying would act normally, unlike those young ladies, and was approachable instead. After hurriedly nodding, she said, “Thank you, Sis Ying. You’re just like Tang Xiu. Both of you are good persons.”</p><p>“Pfft… hehe…”</p><p>Tang Ying couldn’t help giggling and then said, “Well, Lil Sis Xiaomeng. Don’t label me as a good person, alright? Anyways, where did Tang Xiu go? Why don’t I see him here with you?”</p><p>“He went to see Grandpa, Big Sis.” Tang Wei took the opportunity to interject. “It seems that there’s something they need to discuss.”</p><p>After a short while, Tang Xiu led Mu Wanying into the pavilion. After seeing Tian Xiaomeng with Tang Ying, he smiled and paced forward, saying, “You already got acquainted with Xiaomeng, Sis Ying? This girl is kinda timid, so don’t make fun of her.”</p><p>“No worries! How can I scare her? It’s too late since I already protect her now,” Tang Ying smilingly replied. “Anyways, what are you two doing here while holding hands, though? Are you showing off your love or something?”</p><p>“Eh… hehe…” Tang Xiu let out a dry laugh in response.</p><p>At this time, Tian Xiaomeng’s eyes went saucer, looking at Mu Wanying whose hand was pulled by Tang Xiu’s. At this moment, only then did she realize how stupid she was before. Sparing the talents and abilities of this girl, just her appearance, figure, and bearing was all one in the billions. She had never seen anyone like her in real life, but who else could compare with her?</p><p>She was beautiful—too beautiful!</p><p>Even if she was a girl herself, she knew that she felt attracted by Mu Wanying. It was a feeling that made her heart thump faster and harder.</p><p>Mu Wanying came toward Tian Xiaomeng, stretched out her hand and smilingly said, “Hello, I’m Mu Wanying, Tang Xiu’s girlfriend. You’re Xiaomeng, right? Tang Xiu just told me about your situation. But I’m glad that you came to attend Grandpa’s 80th birthday.”</p><p>Instead of answering, Tian Xiaomeng gulped and murmured stutteringly, “You’re… H-hello, I-I’m T-Tian Xiaomeng. I’m… uh, no. I’m glad to be able to… attend Grandpa Tang’s 80th birthday. Mu… ah… Big Sis Wanying, you’re so beautiful, so gorgeous… the most beautiful woman I’ve ever seen.”</p><p>Mu Wanying’s eyes curved in happiness. She turned to glance at Tang Xiu and kindly took Tian Xiaomeng’s hand and smilingly said, “I like you too. You’re Tang Xiu’s friend, so you’re my friend as well. I hope you can treat me as a friend too later.”</p><p>Tian Xiaomeng’s small head nodded repeatedly like a pecking chicken. She then excitedly replied, “I’ll definitely treat you as a good friend, Big Sis Wanying!”</p><p>“Count me in too!” Tang Ying interjected with a smile.</p><p>Tang Xiu, who stood at the side, just watched the girls merrily laugh and talk. He immediately smiled and said, “Well, Sis Ying, Wanying, are you two free this afternoon?”</p><p>Mu Wanying shook her head, whereas Tang Ying straightly asked, “I have nothing to do. What’s up, you got something for us?”</p><p>“Since you’re free, can you accompany Xiaomeng to the TV station?” Tang Xiu asked with a smile. “She kinda has a talk show this afternoon.”</p><p>“Uh… no… there’s no need.” Tian Xiaomeng suddenly spoke, “The program manager wasn’t able to contact me yesterday, so when I just called them, they said… he said that he has already put me off the list.”</p><p>Tang Ying frowned and resentfully said, “Don’t worry about it, Xiaomeng. The TV station said that you’re off the list, huh? Just wait here, I’ll call them. I’ll make sure to have all the interviewees gone and they will just interview you alone. Gimme their number, quickly.”</p><p>Lips twitching, Tian Xiaomeng stutteringly replied, “Uh… S-Sis Ying, t-there’s no need to go that far, r-right? Besides, it doesn’t matter if I don’t partake in it either. I…”</p><p>“That’s why your character will make you easily be bullied, Xiaomeng.” Tang Ying cut off. “You told us that you came to the capital from Star City to get interviewed, but they just kicked you out because they couldn’t contact you yesterday. That’s simply bullying to me. Just trust me and give me the number.”</p><p>Tian Xiaomeng shot a look at Tang Xiu, looking somewhat embarrassed and awkward.</p><p>“Since Sis Ying wants to stand up for you, just give her their phone number,” said Tang Xiu with a smile. “Besides, it’s the program you want to take part in, right? Since you’re invited, don’t let your trip to Beijing be in vain. However, remember to not speak carelessly there, though. Especially what happened in the last two days.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
