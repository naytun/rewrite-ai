Spit it out! Just how did you die? How did you have the opportunity to leave your True Soul behind after you died and enter the cycle of reincarnation to be reborn?”</p><p>Han Qingwu just shook her head without answering Tang Xiu’s question. She slowly shut her eyes and gently opened her hands as the last scene in the Immortal World emerged in her mind: a woman dressed in red from head to toe as if the song of blood had been cast on her. She hugged the dead body of her true love she killed by her own hands, before committing suicide and finally dying.</p><p>At that moment in time, her True Soul had yet to dissipate. Due to her Chrono cultivation art, she found that Tang Xiu’s True Soul hadn’t yet been swallowed by the perpetual river of time but rather tore open the void amid the Heavenly Tribulation and was about to enter the chaos of nothingness. Right at that moment, she cast a forbidden art to follow the last wisp of Tang Xiu’s True Soul and entered the cycle of reincarnation of this plane.</p><p>“Do it!”</p><p>At this moment, Han Qingwu looked oddly calm as her table tennis ball-sized Golden Core flew out of her body and floated in front of her eyebrows.</p><p>Tang Xiu angrily glared at Han Qingwu. Seeing her wholeheartedly ready-to-die face made the tempestuous killing intent inside him to rage crazily. The hand that grasped the sword slightly trembled, and his already bleeding heart felt more and more painful. Being reincarnated, reborn, and gaining a new life looked like it was a sweet dream of grandeur that was so picturesque and beautiful. But now, it felt like nothing but a struggle to crawl out of the Ninth Purgatory of Hell.</p><p>KILL!</p><p>KILL, KILL!!</p><p>KILL, KILL, KILL!!!</p><p>The deepest recess of Tang Xiu’s heart kept roaring. But he felt the divine sword in his hand become heavy to the extreme. He kept struggling and yet kept hesitating, only to find himself unable to finish everything with his hand. That’s right. He just couldn’t do it; regardless of having ascertained the truth of the matter; despite the fact that Xue Qingcheng was the one who made him drink the poison and stabbed his heart. To his sorrow, he found himself drowning in hatred, yet he just couldn’t reap the soul of the one he once loved with all his heart with his divine sword.</p><p>ROAR…</p><p>A roar the likes of a beast came out of Tang Xiu’s throat. He looked like the God of Killing as he finally brandished his sword to tear Han Qingwu’s facial muscle, leaving a bleeding wound on it.</p><p>The stunning beauty of a woman was finally ruined in but a fleeting moment.</p><p>It was but one sword that severed all the last nostalgia between Tang Xiu and Xue Qingcheng. One slash to sever the connection to their past lives, turning it into clouds and rain. He couldn’t kill her, but nothing could prevent him from ruining the face that had been haunting his dreams.</p><p>All that was left was just a melancholic desolation and sorrow.</p><p>All the murderous intent he had toward her had now completely dissipated, replaced by loneliness and vicissitudes of life that took over its place deep in his soul. He slowly turned around and didn’t even glance at Han Qingwu’s current face. After he walked a few steps away from her, he spoke with a hoarse voice with his back facing her, “The sun shined brightly upon the Great Dao, yet only the lone bridge remains. From now henceforth, nothing remains between you and me.”</p><p>Han Qingwu’s sparkling eyes were filled with distressing feelings, yet contained deep love as they followed Tang Xiu’s back. A bright smile suddenly appeared on her face while blood flowed out from the scary wound on her face. Even so, she didn’t lift her hand to wipe it off. Had it been before back when they were in the Immortal World, perhaps she would take the initiative to lift that sword to end her life from this mortal coil even if Tang Xiu didn’t kill her.</p><p>But now, she didn’t do so, for the memories of her past life had now blended with her current life. Her personality had gone through a little change. She knew that nothing remained between them, but she was still able to see him—even if she could only do so from the far corner; even if she must hide in a different spacetime. But she could still look at him from far away.</p><p>When he needed something, then she’d move and act for him!</p><p>When he needed nothing, then she’d just gaze at him!</p><p>At this moment in time, Han Qingwu had already understood what her future life would be like. She existed only for him.</p><p>Under the odd gaze of the two staff outside the door, Tang Xiu listlessly left the ice-skating rink. He didn’t go back to campus, nor did he return to the Bluestar Villa Complex. He didn’t even recall his plan to head to the Hilton Hotel to find Chen Zhizhong. He just strolled on the bustling streets of Shanghai as if he was in a trance, walking everywhere as his feet take him to without aim, just drifting on with no destination.</p><p>The day bled into the night as Tang Xiu came to his senses from his dazed state. He found himself standing at the entrance of the Everlasting Feast Hall’s branch in Shanghai. Eight strong men stood around him forming a circle with him firmly in the middle, preventing anyone from disturbing him.</p><p>The worried-looking, red-dressed Chi Nan was standing and looking at him firmly.</p><p>“Dismiss!”</p><p>Tang Xiu inhaled a deep breath as his Primal Chaos force surged in his meridians. He just unshackled his whole being from his muddled state. The reckoning of the grievance had shaken off the shackle of a mental demon in his psyche. He felt strange as the disappearance of the mental demon unexpectedly improved his soul and perfected the first layer of his Heavenly Art of Cosmic Genesis, the Stars Tyrannical Body, without him realizing it.</p><p>‘It’s enough to kill a Nascent Soul Stage cultivator.’</p><p>He began walking and stepped into the front door of the Everlasting Feast Hall. Under the odd gazes of numerous pairs of eyes, he went straight to the manager’s office on the second floor.</p><p>“Boss!”</p><p>Chi Nan, who kept following him, seemed she wanted to speak. But she hesitated, and the worry in her eyes had yet to dissipate.</p><p>Tang Xiu just shook his head and sat on the soft leather sofa. He took out a cigarette and lit it up. After taking in and out a few puffs, only then did he slowly speak, “Don’t worry! I’m fine.”</p><p>Chi Nan secretly relaxed upon hearing it, asking, “I just came from Jingmen Island this afternoon, Boss. I’ve already handed over the business management here to some others. Are there any other instructions you’d like me to carry out?”</p><p>“Get me something to eat! And accompany me to drink,” said Tang Xiu.</p><p>“I’ll have it arranged right away, Boss.” Chi Nan nodded.</p><p>As Chi Nan left the office, Tang Xiu no longer thought about Han Qingwu. The purpose of his return to Shanghai this time had been achieved, and he had already figured out the truth of this matter and solved it. What had happened in the past and the matter with Xue Qingcheng; he no longer wanted all those to bother him ever again. Everything related to Xue Qingcheng was over, leaving only the enmity with Emperor Danqing, Zither Demon Jiuyao, and some others. As for the Shade Demon Zhu Wushou, he must die.</p><p>That second issue still remains.</p><p>As Tang Xiu recalled the issue with Shanghai University, he suddenly got a faint headache. He didn’t kill Han Qingwu and she probably worked as a teacher at Shanghai University and could be the teacher-in-charge of his class as well.</p><p>‘Haih… forget it. I’ll just suspend my studies.’</p><p>Straightly dropping out of school was not Tang Xiu’s intention since it was the long-cherished wish of his mother to see him getting a university diploma. He just couldn’t let her down on that.</p><p>After he finished smoking the cigarette, Chi Nan returned and respectfully said as she stopped in front of Tang Xiu, “Boss, I already ordered some people. The meal will soon be served. But there’s something I want to report to you before you dine.”</p><p>“What is it?” asked Tang Xiu.</p><p>“Kang Xia looked for you a few days ago. She couldn’t contact you before, so she gave a call,” said Chi Nan. “I didn’t ask her about the issue, but it seems very urgent judging from her voice at the time.”</p><p>‘Kang Xia?’</p><p>Only then did Tang Xiu remember that he hadn’t contacted Kang Xia for a long time. But he knew that she must be very busy managing the Magnificent Tang Corporation’s affairs in the last few months; especially dealing with the issues of the New Metro of Star City insider purchase. That was likely the reason why she didn’t take the initiative to call him. Although it was also possible that she didn’t call him since he often went to places with no phone signal.</p><p>Taking out his cell phone, Tang Xiu dialed Kang Xia’s phone number. Soon after, her voice came out of the phone, “Is it you, Tang Xiu?”</p><p>“Yeah! I just returned to China and am in Shanghai,” said Tang Xiu with a smile.</p><p>“I’ll leave for Shanghai now. I need to see you,” said Kang Xia.</p><p>“I heard from Chi Nan that you’ve been looking for me these days and you seem very anxious. What happened?” asked Tang Xiu.</p><p>“It’s Andy. She got some problems with her body,” answered Kang Xia. “I want you to take a look at her if you have nothing urgent to do.”</p><p>Tang Xiu’s face slightly changed and he asked with a deep voice, “What happened to her?”</p><p>“It seems like she got a problem in her cultivation, like qi deviation or something,” explained Kang Xia bitterly. “She has been in a coma in recent days, so I sent her to the hospital for examination. But the experts there can’t figure out what happened to her, nor can they tell about her condition.”</p><p>“Wait for me in Star City. I’ll be back there right away,” replied Tang Xiu in a deep voice.</p><p>After hanging up, he called Chen Zhizhong and told him to head to the airport and wait. He refused to stay in the Everlasting Feast Hall for dinner and Chi Nan sent him back to the Bluestar Villa Complex as he met his mother, Su Lingyun there.</p><p>“Mom, I need to go back to Star City immediately. Someone is seriously injured there, so I need to rush back to treat her. Are you going to stay in Shanghai for some time or go back to Star City with me?” asked Tang Xiu.</p><p>“Who’s injured, Son? Do I know the person?” asked Su Lingyun hurriedly.</p><p>“You know her. It’s Andy,” answered Tang Xiu.</p><p>“That Andy girl? What happened to her?” asked Su Lingyun quickly. “Then let’s hurry up and go back to Star City! I came to Shanghai to find you, but since you’re going back to Star City, it doesn’t make sense for me to stay here. Everything else is not important. Andy’s injury is the most urgent thing now.”</p><p>Tang Xiu heeded and then called Ouyang Lulu, saying that he needed her private jet to send him and the rest to Star City directly. Just as they exited the Star City Airport, the driver arranged by Chen Zhizhong in advance was already waiting with several cars outside.</p><p>“May I ask where are you going, Master?” asked Chen Zhizhong.</p><p>“I’m heading back to South Gate Town. You can go home with your men first!” answered Tang Xiu. “Andy is injured and she needs me to treat her. I’ll find you again after stabilizing her condition.”</p><p>“Then I’m going with you, Master!” said Chen Zhizhong quickly. “Besides, I have medicinal herbs business, so I can immediately provide you the herbs you need during the treatment.”</p><p>Tang Xiu gave it a thought before refusing his request. He didn’t mind to have Chen Zhizhong following him if Su Lingyun was not around. However, Chen Zhizhong was of the same age as his mother. His mother would definitely feel awkward and uncomfortable when she heard Chen Zhizhong addressing him as Master.</p><p>“Just go home first and wait for me. I’ll call you later when I need your assistance.”</p><p>“As you wish, Master!” Chen Zhizhong nodded.</p><p>****</p><p>In the King Villa of South Gate Town.</p><p>Kang Xia had brought Andy over and was now worried sick as she paced back and forth at the entrance of the villa courtyard, glancing at the South Gate Town complex’s gate every few seconds.</p><p>Andy suddenly had a qi deviation when cultivating, it was something that made her very worried. She regarded Andy as her closest relative beside Tang Xiu, and she didn’t want any mishaps to happen to her, nor did she want to see any accidents that she couldn’t accept.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
