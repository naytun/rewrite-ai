Even Yuan Chuling no longer wanted to manage his gym and just spent his time wandering about to get some good dogs and then made a big profit out of them. He never found such a good chance to make money before, so he brought Yue Kai and Hu Qingsong to the western region to get some excellent dogs.</p><p>Dog fight gambling was very strictly regulated in Shanghai, and they could only participate a few times there, which earned them some money. Yet, it didn’t satisfy them, so the trio and one dog straightly headed to Jingmen Island after hearing that many people were involved in dog fight gambling with large stakes.</p><p>“Alright, let’s play again one last time, then. Each of us will take out one million regardless of the results, but we’ll head immediately back to Shanghai with this Big Yellow afterward. Now that we got some money, we should learn from Big Bro Tang and start thinking of ways to start a business,” said Yue Kai seriously.</p><p>“Now you’re talking. But don’t count me in, will you? I already started my own business with my buddy, and it’s been quite great.” Yuan Chuling grinned. “You don’t know how much profit I can get from my fitness club, do you? It’s in the tens of millions!”</p><p>Yue Kai and Hu Qingsong rolled their eyes at the same time and gave him the middle finger. The former then murmured, “Yeah, yeah… you make it like I dunno if you’re holding on Big Bro Tang’s thigh to get rich, yet you dare to show it off. In any case, we could become a billionaire ourselves if Big Bro Tang gave us some tips and tricks for making money. Speaking of him, where has he been recently? I’ve been calling him, but his phone has been off. I can’t invite him to have some drinking party with chicks.”</p><p>“Hehe, like you don’t know Big Bro Tang has so many belles around him, Yue Kai. All of them are the best top chicks!” Yuan Chuling mocked him and said, “If you can drag him to a drinking party with chick attendants, I’ll treat you as a big brother, Dude.”</p><p>Cough, cough…</p><p>Yue Kai coughed a few times and touched the bridge of his nose with his hand to cover his embarrassed face. He was crystal clear that Tang Xiu had never been proactive in picking up girls. What happened was that those flowers kept coming after him, instead. Tang Xiu was a man whose luck in love affairs made him greatly jealous.</p><p>“Alright, guys. I’ll make a phone call.”</p><p>Yuan Chuling fished out his cell phone and dialed a number. After his call was picked up, he then said, “I just agreed to meet Han Sen at the previous old place to gamble like last time. And I told him we’ll leave Jingmen Island and return to Shanghai regardless of the results.”</p><p>Two hours later, just as the trio left Venus Hotel and boarded a small van, Yuan Chuling’s phone rang.</p><p>“It must be Han Sen. This guy is kinda anxious, so he’s calling us to hurry up, no?” Yuan Chuling grinned and took out his cell phone with a smile. But after he saw the caller on the screen, he suddenly got up.</p><p>“Aargh, shit!”</p><p>The pain caused by bumping his head on the roof made him see stars and curse. After screaming, he sat back and pressed the answer button. “Yo, Big Bro Tang, you really have no conscience at all, do you? What have you been up to recently, huh? I’ve been calling you all the time but never once did you pick up. Are you forgetting these several brothers of yours since you got those flowers glued on you all the time?”</p><p>“What nonsense are you spitting out?” Tang Xiu mocked him back. “I have too many things to deal with recently and the phone signal in that place is abysmal, you know. That’s why I can’t receive any call at all. Anyhow, who are these several brothers you just mentioned aside from you, though?”</p><p>“It’s Yue Kai and Hu Qingsong,” answered Yuan Chuling while rubbing his head.</p><p>“Huh? How did the three of you get together?” asked Tang Xiu with a confused tone.</p><p>“Well, I visited your campus some time ago. But since I couldn’t find you, I went to play and fool around with them for a few days,” said Yuan Chuling. “I never thought I’d hit it off with them, though, so we just left Shanghai since we found some, well… common interest. That’s right, where are you now, Bro? We’re in Jingmen Island. Do you wanna fly over to meet us?”</p><p>“Just tell me the place. I’ll go over to find you,” Tang Xiu replied with a smile.</p><p>“Huh? The address?” Yuan Chuling stared dumbly and immediately said in surprise, “Are you saying you’re also in Jingmen Island?”</p><p>“Yup!” replied Tang Xiu with a chuckle.</p><p>“Then head straight to the Kingfishers Park, Big Bro,” said Yuan Chuling immediately. “You know where it is, right? Just use the GPS and you’ll get there. It’s a great place. The three of us are going to gamble with some people, so we’ll be there in half an hour. Just hurry up and cheer on us later.”</p><p>“Huh? What do you mean you’re gambling?” Tang Xiu inquired in a curious tone.</p><p>“There’s no way I can explain it to you with one or two sentences,” said Yuan Chuling, “You’ll know it when you come, and I’m damn sure what we play will brighten your eyes!”</p><p>“Okay, then!” Tang Xiu curtly replied and directly hung up.</p><p>Quickly, the Yuan Chuling trio rushed to the Kingfishers Park in a small van. In the remoter corner of the park, more than a dozen young men were pulling four leashed fighting dogs and smoking. There was a young man with bleached hair with earrings complacently conversing with his buddies.</p><p>“Here we come, Han Sen!”</p><p>Yuan Chuling’s hand was holding a rope as he pulled a big yellow dog, followed by Yue Kai and Hu Qingsong.</p><p>The white-haired young man called Han Sen threw the cigarette butt on the ground, stepped on it, and then strode to meet them. “You won thrice and got tons of money from us in the past few days, Fatty Yuan, so my buddies want to have revenge today. Have you seen the fighting dog I just bought? This guy will definitely bite your Big Yellow to death!”</p><p>“Hah, you keep saying that before each game, Han Sen.” Yuan Chuling rolled his eyes and growled. “All right, dude, we’re kinda in a hurry. We’ll return to Shanghai after winning the game!”</p><p>A cold light flashed in Han Sen’s eyes after hearing it. He turned to look at the yellow-haired youth nearby. As he saw the other party give him a curt nod, he suddenly let out a happy smile. He shot a squinted glance at the Dahuang dog Yuan Chuling was holding without anyone noticing.</p><p>“How about playing the game with a bigger stake this time, Yuan Chuling? Like, my team will bet 8 million and you’ll get 8 million from us if you win, and we’ll get the same amount from you if it’s our win.”</p><p>When Yuan Chuling was about to reply, Yue Kai raised his chin and interjected. “Well, let alone 8 million, we’ll take you on even if it’s 18 million. But we always win tons of money every time, so I don’t think it’s a good idea. Let’s just take out 3 million for the first game, and whoever loses will give 3 million to the winner. We’ll be staying a few more days later and we’ll talk to you whether we’ll continue the game.”</p><p>“Deal!”</p><p>After gambling with Yuan Chuling trio several times, Han Sen could tell that the fella named Yue Kai was very astute, so he didn’t want to speak much longer since they had made up their minds.</p><p>Quickly, the two men took their own dogs to a cage. Just as Yuan Chuling was about to let the Big Yellow dog into the cage, two black SUVs headed over from the distance.</p><p>“Hey, Big Bro Tang!”</p><p>Yuan Chuling and the others immediately let out happy and surprised looks upon seeing Tang Xiu.</p><p>After Tang Xiu came out of the car, his eyes swept over at everyone present. Then, he came over and asked, “What are you guys doing here? This setting… it’s a dog fight, isn’t it?”</p><p>Grinning, Yuan Chuling said, “Well, I have no way else to make money, so I can only make some pocket money this way. Anyhow, just wait and see, Big Bro Tang! Let’s have a big party after we win this 3-million game!”</p><p>Tang Xiu rolled his eyes in response. He turned to look at Yue Kai and Hu Qingsong, saying, “To think that you’re learning to gamble from Yuan Chuling, you two really got some screws loose in the head by following him, don’t you? Stop fooling around and follow me! Since we’ve gathered in Jingmen Island, let’s have some time together. I’m going to somewhere else tomorrow morning.”</p><p>“Huh? Where to?” asked Yuan Chuling.</p><p>“Overseas,” said Tang Xiu.</p><p>Han Sen felt out of sorts from the way he looked at Yuan Chuling and Tang Xiu’s group. If it wasn’t for Tang Xiu coming with several burly men, he could’ve taken the initiative to assault them.</p><p>Suddenly, a clear voice was heard, “You know dog fight is illegal, Yuan Chuling. You should be arrested and even sentenced to jail for doing this, you know.”</p><p>Yuan Chuling’s eyes shifted to Cheng Yannan and he immediately looked surprised. “Wah… my old classmate. How come you’re with Tang Xiu? Don’t tell me you’re also…”</p><p>“Cut the crap!” Cheng Yannan hurriedly interrupted.</p><p>Yuan Chuling rolled his eyes and murmured, “Bah. You don’t want me to say it, then I’ll zip my mouth. Besides, everyone already knows everything about you. If anything, it’s not like a dog fight is against the law, no? Even if it is, we still got Big Bro Tang! It’s easy for us to get out with his ability.”</p><p>Not far away from them, Han Sen was finally unable to bear anymore and asked aloud, “Hey, are you gonna play or not? If you are, then hurry up, will you? I’ve been waiting all the time to win the money and spend my days off partying!”</p><p>Tang Xiu’s eyes swept over at the dog pulled by Han Sen. Then, he looked at the big yellow dog held by Yuan Chuling. He then shook his head and said, “No need to compare it. You’ve lost already, Yuan Chuling.”</p><p>Yuan Chuling was dumbfounded and hastily asked, “Nobody has lost the game, Big Bro Tang. The fight hasn’t even begun yet, so how do you know I’m gonna lose? This big yellow dog of mine is an invincible fighter God. He’s been our golden goose all this while.”</p><p>Tang Xiu watched Yuan Chuling bring the big yellow dog to the front of the cage after the fella spoke. He couldn’t help but feel a bit helpless after seeing this guy send the dog into the cage.</p><p>With his keen eyes, it was easy for him to see that something was amiss with the big yellow dog’s condition. Even without a careful inspection, he could see that the big yellow dog had been drugged.</p><p>This was simply a skullduggery!</p><p>Tang Xiu was glad that he had come over, or else Yuan Chuling, Yue Kai, and Hu Qingsong would’ve been trapped in the scheme.</p><p>Forget it. I’ll just move a bit to kill that violent fighting dog after the dogs start fighting! thought Tang Xiu.</p><p>The two big, ferocious dogs started glaring at each other as though they were facing their own nemesis. Suddenly, the ferocious fighting dog instantly charged at the big yellow dog. In just a blink of an eye, the big yellow dog fell to the ground the moment it avoided the attack.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
