It didn’t even know that much about these creatures and just relied on their records it once read, giving it some fragmentary knowledge about them.</p><p>“Are you going to fall into slumber again, Star Devourer Insect?” asked Tang Xiu thoughtfully, as he couldn’t figure out this creature’s condition at present.</p><p>“This plane has strong suppression against me,” said Star Devourer Insect. “It would likely be very dangerous if I were to unleash all my power here. The likelihood that I’ll fall into a slumber for a very long time is very high even if I can save my own life.”</p><p>Tang Xiu nodded without a word. He was crystal clear that Star Devourer Insect was correct. Heavenly Dao Law of this plane was extremely powerful, and there was absolutely no room for any experts to alter it. The only option would either be erasing it or expelling it from this world. Even if he had special means to protect the Star Devourer Insect, it would still likely be as it said, grievously injured and falling into a long slumber.</p><p>“Then, we’ll act depending on the situation. If these demonic beasts bring too much harm, I’ll need you to act. But you can rest assured that I’ll make sure to preserve your life, so you’ll only fall into slumber at most. Furthermore, I’ll also spare some time to concoct medicinal pills that benefit you later.”</p><p>“Medicinal pills?” the thought transmitted by the Star Devourer Insect was somewhat strange.</p><p>“That’s right, it’s the Myriad Bestial Pill.” Tang Xiu confirmed. “This pill is taken by the Immortal Beasts in the Immortal World. We are not in the Immortal World, so I can’t find spiritual herbs needed to refine this pill. But I still can concoct a slightly worse grade. It will benefit you greatly even if you’re not injured.”</p><p>“I know this pill! It’s called the Immortal Pill in the Immortal World.” Star Devourer Insect was excited and replied, “That would be great, Master. I never thought that I’d also have the opportunity to take this Immortal elixir!”</p><p>Tang Xiu no longer engaged in the conversation with Star Devouring Insect. Now that he knew that it had sobered up from its slumber, it was nigh time to immediately start his plan.</p><p>Quickly after, the 201 disciples of the Tang Sect at Foundation Establishment Stage and above assembled. After shooting a glance at the five teams in front, Tang Xiu then said with a deep voice, “Mo Awu, Jin Shi, Ye Shisan, and Hao Lei. You four will lead your teams and immediately enter the depths of the mountains and begin hunting demonic beasts. Do keep in mind that preserving your lives take priority over hunting and killing demonic beasts. Furthermore, you must return here every night. I’ll assign a few others to record the number of demonic beasts you’ve hunted every night and you’ll get cultivation resources as rewards. This time is an opportunity for you all. As long as you secure an excellent record, you can expect massive resources which will benefit you greatly in tempering your strength.”</p><p>“Understood!”</p><p>The 201 disciples of the Tang Sect immediately were excited. Obtaining cultivation resources was normally never easy, while the number of cultivation resources they needed kept increasing along with their progress in cultivation. Apart from spending their fortune to purchase them in the sect, the only other means was to obtain their annual allocation. Although the limited resources were sufficient for their cultivation now, it was far from enough in the long run.</p><p>Hence, this meant that they would get double the benefits at present. They could sharpen themselves while also obtaining more resources for their cultivation.</p><p>Seize this chance!</p><p>It was a warning they told themselves in their hearts.</p><p>After glancing at everyone’s faces, Tang Xiu was satisfied upon seeing their firm expressions. He then nodded and said, “Set off!”</p><p>“GO!”</p><p>Mo Awu, Jin Shi, Ye Shisan, and Hao Lei led their teams, turning into a group of shadows that quickly flew towards the depths of the Himalayas.</p><p>Tang Xiu himself didn’t hurry to leave. His eyes glanced over the remaining 37 disciples of the Tang Sect in front of him. After being silent for a while, he looked Gu Yin and then spoke to the rest, “Gu Yin may be an expert at Golden Core Stage now, but she has yet to experience actual combat and battle, so combat efficiency-wise, she’s unlikely to be as good as the rest of you. Therefore, I hope you all can protect her during the battle. I believe that as long as she adapts to the brutal fights, she can kill a lot of demonic beasts at a later stage and, in turn, will win more resources for this team.”</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>The other 36 disciples of Tang Sect suddenly set their eyes on Gu Yin with admiration. Gu Yin was very young, yet her cultivation talent was truly against heaven. She had even reached the Golden Core Stage in just a year and a half.</p><p>At present, all of them were experts at Foundation Establishment, which made them realize that the higher the level of cultivation, the greater the gap between the levels was. They could easily kill cultivators at Qi Refining Stage, but at the same time, they were also easy prey for experts at Golden Core Stage. While Gu Yin was the only expert at Golden Core Stage in their team, if her combat efficiency was raised, then the likelihood that they could kill more demonic beasts would also significantly increase. Hence, the more resources they could get for their cultivation. It was definitely a good thing for all of them.</p><p>“Then go!”</p><p>Tang Xiu no longer stayed and his figure was as though transformed into a lightning bolt that blitzed towards the depths of the Himalayas. He didn’t have any shred of fear even though there were a lot of demonic beasts there since his combat sense had been tempered after countless battles.</p><p>After a few minutes, a few figures silently appeared in the place everyone had just left. It was Duanmu Lin, whose face looked solemn. His eyes looked a bit complicated as he looked at the direction where Tang Xiu and the rest vanished from.</p><p>Once in the past, he had dreaded and feared Tang Xiu’s strength, as well as feared the Everlasting Feast Hall’s existence. His fear was that Tang Xiu would have thoughts of disloyalty and thus lead to changes in this country, thus leading to his worry that the pattern of this country would be broken.</p><p>After many contacts with him, however, he gradually found that his fear was unfounded. If Tang Xiu really really thought to rebel, he would’ve already acted given his personal strength and the number of experts under his control.</p><p>Yet, he did not.</p><p>He even stood up when the country needed him again and again, and played a huge role to aid both the people and the development of the country. In particular, this crisis situation with the demonic beasts. It was nigh on impossible for the country to guarantee that they wouldn’t fall into a pandemonium unless they mobilized a large number of troops and resorted to using the horrifyingly powerful weapons in their arsenal.</p><p>“A loyal soul, bold, has a sense of justice and is patriotic. If I could have a few more heroic young men like him in China, the state’s power would likely be improved greatly.” Duanmu Lin sighed with an approving expression.</p><p>At the side, a middle-aged man in black wushu suit and a chignon hairdo wore a contemptuous expression and indifferently interjected. “Director Duanmu, aren’t you exaggerating? Just relying on them… we can greatly enhance the national strength of our country? I admit that their little bit of strength is good, but recklessly rushing into the depths of the Himalayas like this is nothing but foolish and just looking for their own demise.”</p><p>Another old man in Chinese tunic suit and a walking stick nodded in approval. “We’ve seen the power of those demonic beasts as well. I can say that I’m very powerful, yet I’m very clear that I’m slightly inferior to some of them. That Tang Xiu dares to bring his people to traverse deeper is nothing but a reckless act. Well, it seems like our ancestors were right that you can only hone your ability if you are devoted to one field. He does have some talent in Chinese medicine, but he’s just a rookie in fighting wars.”</p><p>At their words, Duanmu Lin slightly furrowed his brows as he glanced at the middle-aged man and the old man. These two men had extraordinary backgrounds. The former was Hun Sen of a hidden formidable cultivator clan that boasted thousands of people, each of whom was a cultivator. The old man’s name was Jiang Shuisheng, and he was also a cultivator who had broken through the Golden Core Stage and had more than a dozen disciples. While the weakest was at Qi Refining Stage, most of them were experts at the Foundation Establishment Stage.</p><p>It took him so much effort to invite them over that his lips were almost worn out just. They also led their own people and had fought with those demonic beasts, leading to some of them getting injured.</p><p>As his eyes shifted back to the mountains, he let out some meaningful words. “I may not understand the others, but I still know something about him. He can always surprise me with the astonishing potential he can unleash every time. It’s a hunch of mine that he won’t disappoint me either this time.”</p><p>Hun Sen and Jiang Shuisheng exchanged glances and similarly let out contemptuous expressions at the same time.</p><p>The former suddenly let out a particular strange smile and looked at Duanmu Lin. “Director Duanmu, since you value that kid so highly, you make me want to see his ability. How about going there and have a look, then? Besides, we can give them a hand should they be in danger later!”</p><p>Likewise, Jiang Shuisheng approved with a nod. “My thoughts exactly since Director Duanmu values him that highly. I also want to see his followers’ strengths. If anything, we’ve repelled the demonic beasts from the East line, Director Duanmu. I don’t think those beasts will hit our blockade line in the next few hours, so how about going there and having a look?”</p><p>Duanmu Lin hesitated for a moment before shaking his head. “No. I need to stay to preside over the overall situation. I can’t leave at will like that. But you can go if you want to see their performance!”</p><p>Hun Sen and Jiang Shuisheng nodded simultaneously. The two men instantly flashed and left their afterimages, their direction where Tang Xiu and his men had disappeared.</p><p>A smile then outlined on the corner of Duanmu Lin’s lips. He wasn’t clear about Tang Xiu’s current strength, but he was sure that it was absolutely powerful. Both Hun Sen and Jiang Shuisheng were so arrogant that he was a bit troubled in dispatching them. If Tang Xiu could make them see what a being powerful was, they would probably have a change in attitude, so he would be able to relax a lot in the next scheduling.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>A lightning-fast shadow instantly appeared in front of Duanmu Lin. Aquababe, whose face was extremely solemn, handed over a stack of photos and reported with a deep voice. “Chief, the surveillance footage shows a large gathering of demonic beasts in a valley 46 kilometers away from the middle line. These are the pictures just sent to us.”</p><p>With a change in expression, Duanmu Lin quickly saw the photos and then asked with a deep voice, “How many are there? Is there any particular kind of demonic beast among them?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
