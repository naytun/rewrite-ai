Its price may not bounce back for a short time. Why don’t you sell all of them to me? You can rest assured that I’ll buy it at a higher price. How about 320?”</p><p>320? 30 yuan more than the current price?</p><p>“I’ll sell them to you if you want them, Mr. Tang,” answered Zuo Daquan without hesitation. “But may I know for what purpose you are buying so much gold for?”</p><p>“I’m sure you just saw a lot of things you shouldn’t have seen tonight, so I won’t hide it from you,” replied Tang Xiu smilingly. “I need gold to refine some magic tools and weapons. You seem to have hoarded a lot of them here, and you can’t refine them into magical artifacts, so I want to buy however many you have in reserve.”</p><p>Manufacturing magic tools from gold?</p><p>Zuo Daquan’s eyes instantly sparkled. He recalled the battle Tang Xiu’s people just engaged in. They used their immortal and divine swords to fly in the air. If… if he could have such a magical sword, then it would be great.</p><p>The thought, however, made him hesitate for a moment. He asked in a low voice, “Can you sell me a magic weapon you’ve refined from the gold, Mr. Tang, in exchange for gold? Also, how much gold do you need for it?”</p><p>Trading gold for a magic tool?</p><p>With a strange expression, Tang Xiu couldn’t help but laugh, “Haha, you misunderstand me, Mr. Zuo. The magical artifact I refine can only be used by cultivators. It’s something ordinary people can’t control and would be of little use for you even if you buy it.”</p><p>A look of disappointment appeared on Zuo Daquan’s face. However, as he remembered how powerful those immortal swords were, he gritted his teeth and said, “No matter how little its use is, I’d still want it. At worst, at least I can treat it as the treasured heirloom of my family.”</p><p>Tang Xiu pondered for a moment before he nodded and smiled. “If so, then I’ll trade one of them to you after refining it. However, what kind of tool or weapon do you need exactly?”</p><p>“A sword. It’s best if it’s like the sword you and your men used,” said Zuo Daquan. “It’s truly amazing and very powerful.”</p><p>His answer courted Tang Xiu’s contempt inwardly. He wanted to trade gold for immortal or divine swords? That was the unfunniest joke ever! Let alone his divine sword, just the immortal swords used by Mo Awu, Jin Shi, and the others were of high-grade even in the Immortal World. The value of such magical artifacts was something that not even 100 mountains of gold could buy, which was just worlds apart.</p><p>Kanaja, who stood at the side, also had eyes lit. Although he didn’t witness the scene of the battle, for the coconut plantation to be ruined by cold weapons only meant that the weapons were very powerful. Perhaps, the destruction was partly because of these weapons.</p><p>Astute, experienced, and as crafty and sly as a fox was a perfect description of Kanaja. The conversation made his heart perk up and he interjected, “Can you also sell much such an artifact, Mr. Tang? I want to buy it from you too. I can also exchange it with gold. If you wish, I can also get more than the gold stored here in a few days.”</p><p>A smile crept up on Tang Xiu’s face. He seemed to have found another means to make fortune here. He then nodded and said, “Well, I’ll also refine one for you since you want it, Kanaja. Alright, I’ll stay in Bangkok for some time, so you and Mr. Zuo should find your way to get the gold. The more, the better. If you got some tons of gold, I’ll also give you some extra benefits.”</p><p>Extra benefits?</p><p>Kanaja and Zuo Daquan exchanged glances and immediately nodded.</p><p>“Whoosh…”</p><p>A figure bolted lightning-fast from the outside and appeared in front of Tang Xiu in the blink of an eye. It was Xue Sha, who then reported with a bit of worry on his face, “We lost them, Boss.”</p><p>“You lost them? What about Tang Guang?” Tang Xiu’s face changed, and he asked in a deep voice.</p><p>“Tang Guang was able to catch up with Singkuo and the other one, but a group of people suddenly got in the way. Although they were very weak, their defense was very strong. There were too many of them, so he killed them all, but Singkuo and the other guy had already escaped by then. He and Mo Awu are still after them, but the chance to catch up with them is slim.”</p><p>Tang Xiu clenched his fists and looked at Kanaja, saying, “You’re Bangkok’s local snake; you’ve got forces all over this place. Help me find Singkuo and one man. If your people can find any of them in advance, I’ll strike a much bigger deal with you later after Singkuo has been neutralized. You can expect that it will be the biggest opportunity you’ve ever had in your lifetime.”</p><p>Kanaja’s eyes completely lit up, and he answered without hesitation, “I’ll assign my men to look for them at once. We’ll definitely find them even if I must overturn the whole of Bangkok.”</p><p>At his promise, Tang Xiu nodded. He looked back at Xue Sha and asked, “What about Singluen? Where’s he?”</p><p>“He’s on the way back, but they are much slower than I am, so I got here first,” answered Xue Sha.</p><p>Shortly after, Singluen and some of his trusted men arrived. When he appeared before Tang Xiu, his expression was particularly intense and bitter. “I’m sorry Mr. Tang.”</p><p>“There’s no need to feel sorry about anything, Singluen.” Tang Xiu shook his head and said, “Singkuo is our common enemy. I already asked Kanaja to help find him. We just need to find and then kill them. Also, I suggest that you take on your father as well now.”</p><p>Singluen hurried said, “We haven’t yet been able to kill Singkuo, I’m afraid that if we strike my father now…”</p><p>“What you’re afraid of is a subject to deal with later.” Tang Xiu sneered and said, “Besides, those Shaman Guardians who are loyal to your father have returned. They must have notified your old man of our deeds. It’s best to take on your father as well. Only then will you be able to be your clan’s patriarch.”</p><p>“About this…” Singluen still hesitated.</p><p>At the side, a horrified look could be seen plastered on Kanaja’s face as he rapidly interjected, “Singluen, you want to kill Singtuo? But he’s your old man! I know that he truly cares about you two brothers.”</p><p>“We didn’t have the intention to kill my father, really.” Singluen shook his head and said, “It’s just that he’s been a Patriarch of my clan for too long. He’s quite spent now due to it. It’s necessary for him to pass the patriarch seat and just enjoy his life to its fullest.”</p><p>Kanaja understood at once and sighed, “The Chinese say that every place produces talented people every generation who will replace their predecessors. Now that you’ve literally grown up, your old man should indeed pass his seat. Furthermore, with Mr. Tang supporting you, I believe the Dark Shaman Clan will be more prosperous in the future.”</p><p>“It’s no use speaking about that now,” commented Tang Xiu lightly. “So, what’s your decision, Singluen?”</p><p>Singluen took a deep breath and made up his mind, stating in a heavy voice, “Mr. Tang, you’ve suggested that it’s time for my father to abdicate. That time is ripened now, so we’re going to take the seat! But please spare his life if he refuses.”</p><p>“I’m fine with that.” Tang Xiu nodded and said, “We only have one purpose; to create a new Dark Shaman Clan Patriarch. It’s not a problem to spare him if he doesn’t refuse as long as you sit in that seat.”</p><p>“My father will definitely agree.” Singluen gratefully glanced at Tang Xiu and added, “He’s always been a wise man.”</p><p>***</p><p>The Dark Shaman Clan’s land.</p><p>Singtuo silently stood by the window while looking towards the distance. He had been waiting for a long time and felt a bit restless since he hadn’t yet received any news.</p><p>Cultivators from China?</p><p>He knew how powerful those cultivators were. Their divine abilities and magical powers were simply overwhelming and invincible. He had once fought several cultivators in the past, but he neither lost nor won.</p><p>“Are you restless?”</p><p>An old voice suddenly came from behind him as an aged face with a frail figure appeared.</p><p>“Please don’t ask what you know already, Father,” replied Singtuo with a forced smile after turning back. “I fought my big brother in the past to take over the patriarch seat, and you also knew about that clearly, didn’t you, Father? Weren’t you also worried when we battled each other then?”</p><p>“You’re right.” The old man slowly nodded and sighed. “But you must realize that the young will do all right on their own. The world is always for the strong, whereas the weak will sweep the bottom. Singkuo has courage and resourcefulness and is definitely the most suitable candidate as patriarch. While Singluen is helped by Chinese cultivators, he’s likely to not have what it takes to weather the storm. And you… why don’t you ease up a little?”</p><p>“You’ve fought with several cultivators, so you also know how powerful they are, Father.” Singtuo shook his head and said, “The cultivators who appear around Singluen are very young, but I’m afraid they are harboring malice.”</p><p>“Then send Singshou out if you’re still uneasy,” said the old man after thinking and nodding. “You’re the most powerful expert in our clan on the surface, but the fact is I and Singshou are more powerful than you. I’ve been stuck in my cultivation for years and have been unable to break through, but Singshou already has shown signs to transcend.”</p><p>“Singshou’s cultivation has reached to that degree?” Singtuo was shocked.</p><p>“He obtained the God of Wizardry canonical scripture half a year ago and learned a powerful wizardry art. He doesn’t deserve to be regarded as the most outstanding cultivation genius of the Dark Shaman Clan for the last several hundred years if he couldn’t achieve his current status.”</p><p>Singtuo trembled. It took him a long time before he snapped back and shook his head, muttering while sighing, “It seems like Singshou will be the most powerful expert of our clan then. But what about you, Father? Why don’t you tell our clansmen that you’re still alive then?”</p><p>“I keep getting a hunch that a huge incident is going to happen to our clan shortly, so don’t tell anyone that I’m still alive. Not even Singkuo and Singluen,” said the old man vaguely.</p><p>Suddenly, the old man gazed out of the window and lightly said, “Well, they are back. But is Singli not with the 13 Shaman Guardians?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
