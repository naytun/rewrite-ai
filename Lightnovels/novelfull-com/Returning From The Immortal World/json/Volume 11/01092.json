A chilling light flashed in his eyes upon seeing the badly scarred Jin Shi as he asked in a heavy voice, “What happened?”</p><p>Struggling to stand up from the chair, Jin Shi bitterly replied, “We’ve been ambushed by a group of unknown origin. There were a lot of them, and they were also very strong.”</p><p>“You have yet to figure out their identity?” asked Tang Xiu with a frown.</p><p>“They just popped up and hit us in surprise right away, leaving us no time to figure out anything.” Jin Shi shook his head. “But I’m sure they’re not normal humans given their actions. They are much like… Genetic Warrior…”</p><p>Lighting up a cigarette, Tang Xiu said, “I may have some ideas on their origins.”</p><p>“You know where they come from, Sect Master?” Jin Shi was surprised. “How can that be? You haven’t even seen them…”</p><p>Tang Xiu raised his hand to interrupt him and calmly said, “Do you remember the Brain Assembly Biotech in Shanghai and Xie Zhiqiang, who researched some genetic drugs back then?”</p><p>“Yeah, I remember them.” Jin Shi nodded.</p><p>“That man who had some dealings with Xie Zhiqiang in Shanghai was called Austin Cole from SOE company or something,” said Tang Xiu. “This company deals with drugs and medical equipment business on the surface, but it’s actually a very mysterious arms dealer company in Europe. Austin Cole was the third in command in this SOE company, and he controlled less than half of the SOE company’s armed forces. Although he died in Shanghai, I think this SOE company hasn’t given up on the genetic agents and is likely cooperating with other research institutions aside from Xie Zhiqiang’s.”</p><p>“You mean… those people who ambushed us were from this SOE company, Sect Master?” asked Jin Shi. “But I don’t get why they attacked us. Austin Cole is dead, and so is Xie Zhiqiang. We seized the genetic agents and nobody knows that.”</p><p>“There’s no wall with no ears in this world, mind you.” Tang Xiu grimly smiled. “Don’t forget the existence of the Darkwind organization. The intel operatives of this organization are simply everywhere in the world. We previously thought the fact that we killed Xie Zhiqiang and got the genetic agents was very secretive, but it may have been discovered by some intel operatives of this Darkwind organization.”</p><p>“Sovereign, it’s high time for us to annihilate this Darkwind organization,” replied Jin Shi angrily. “Otherwise, anything we do has the risk of being exposed.”</p><p>“The Darkwind will definitely be destroyed, but it’s not yet the time,” said Tang Xiu vaguely. “The full force of our sect is very strong, but we are too few in number. We may be able to kill some flocks of docile sheep, but still, it will be troublesome for us if the number is too many.”</p><p>“Then let’s neutralize all the top executives of this Darkwind organization directly. That would be enough, right?” said Jin Shi.</p><p>Tang Xiu shook his head and said, “Do you know where the Darkwind’s headquarters is, and who their top executives are?”</p><p>“About that…” Jin Shi was speechless and dumbfounded.</p><p>Tang Xiu took out his mobile phone and quickly searched Song Guanghui’s number. Since the most powerful man in Saipan had died, Song Guanghui had become the acting chief executive of Saipan. Although his current temporary title had yet to be removed, Tang Xiu learned from Song Guanghui that the position of the highest officer in Saipan wouldn’t escape from his hands.</p><p>“Hello, Uncle Song. There’s something I need your help with.”</p><p>“You need my assistance? That makes me happy, kid. So tell me, what is it?” Song Guanghui chuckled.</p><p>“My men have been attacked in Saipan a little over two days ago and were forced to flee in bad conditions,” said Tang Xiu. “However, the thing is, they don’t know who those people are, nor do they know their origins. But it’s been confirmed that they should be Genetic Warriors and are very likely to be related to the SOE company. Have you heard about this said company, Uncle Song?”</p><p>“The SOE?” Song Guanghui’s voice tone involuntarily rose.</p><p>Song Guanghui was silent for half a minute. Then, he slowly said, “You ask me whether I know it? What I know is beyond that. I know very well about this company since I even planted some people there. Tang Xiu, if the people who ambushed your men are really from there, it’s very likely there are more things than meet the eye. We need to talk it over… carefully.”</p><p>Tang Xiu’s mind shifted and he inquired. “Is it related to the incidents in the past?”</p><p>“Correct. They pushed us to the brink,” said Song Guanghui. “It may not have been done by this SOE company directly, but another company that’s been controlled by the same family who owns SOE. This family is called as House Dolan.”</p><p>“How come I haven’t heard about this House, though?” murmured Tang Xiu with a frown.</p><p>“In this world, some families are famous and some are hidden in the dark, yet they are controlling massive wealth and power.” Song Guanghui said, “House Dolan is the latter; they operate some businesses but we haven’t found their base so far, though we’ve been secretly investigating some forces we found to be under this House.”</p><p>“Uncle Song, if those people who ambushed my men are really from the SOE company, it’s very likely this House Dolan is far more powerful than imagined. Those Genetic Warriors are very strong. They struck heavy blows to my men, even though they are already powerful people.”</p><p>“If so, then you want me to find and confirm the identity of those people who ambushed your men, whether they are from the SOE company or not, yes?” Song Guanghui inquired.</p><p>“That’s right,” said Tang Xiu.</p><p>“I’ll get it done immediately. Just wait for my message,” said Song Guanghui.</p><p>“Uncle Song, please do not act rashly after you found anyone from the SOE company in Saipan. Just inform me and I’ll send my own men immediately.” Tang Xiu urged.</p><p>“Rest assured,” said Song Guanghui. “Even your men were unable to face them, so I naturally won’t touch them. Facing them head-on will be like trying to hit a boulder with an egg.”</p><p>Tang Xiu was at ease upon hearing his response. After hanging up, he mulled over it for a while and then decided to leave for Saipan immediately. Regardless of whether those people who ambushed Jin Shi’s team were from the SOE company or not, they dared to become Tang Sect’s enemies, so they must pay a painful price. Certainly, if they were really from that company, it meant that it put more tabs to their enmity, which demanded retaliation from him.</p><p>This time, Tang Xiu didn’t bring many people, but all of them were Tang Sect’s elites. Not only did he bring Tang Guang and Tang An, but also Mo Awu, Hao Lei, Kuwako Yamamoto, and Tang 28.</p><p>After quite a while, a group of seven people appeared in the port of Saipan, and Tom Reggie, who got the news in advance, caught up with them to personally fetch them up.</p><p>As several SUVs were heading to Lao Bay Resort, Tang Xiu leaned back against the seat, his eyes sparkling, full of thoughtfulness. Then, he asked, “Has the official appointment of Uncle Song’s position been passed down?”</p><p>“It has been passed down two days ago. He’s the highest official of Saipan now,” said Tom Reggie. “Everything about the previous one has been cleaned up and won’t leave any impact.”</p><p>Tang Xiu slowly nodded and said, “Anyways, you won’t be involved in dealing with the current problem since there are some other things I need you to deal with!”</p><p>“What would you like me to do, Boss?” asked Tom Reggie hurriedly.</p><p>“Do you still remember Spectre and those who got rescued from that prison?” asked Tang Xiu.</p><p>“Yeah, I remember them.” Tom Reggie nodded.</p><p>“I need you to mix with them and observe their situation,” said Tang Xiu. “Pick out some reliable people secretly, and then set up a temporary organization. It doesn’t need to have many people, just 50 are enough.”</p><p>“What kind of organization would you like me to set up, Boss? Like, its main mission…” asked Tom Reggie.</p><p>“You used to be an expert who went through the flame of the battlefields,” said Tang Xiu. “You have rich combat experience, and there’s no issue with your killing skills. I’ve trained some children, so I’m considering sending them to see some blood. Therefore, your mission will be to lead these children, set up a small team and send them to any place with conflicts all over the world.”</p><p>“I’ll carry out your arrangement, Boss.” Tom Reggie nodded.</p><p>“If anything, this issue is not that urgent and you don’t need to rush it,” continued Tang Xiu. “I’ll give you a special training first while teaching you a cultivation technique to further strengthen your power, so you can survive longer on the battlefield.”</p><p>Tom Reggie was excited and said, “Thanks a lot, Boss. You can expect my best in carrying this out.”</p><p>As noon came, Tang Xiu met Song Guanghui, who rushed to Lao Bay Resort in secret. This time, the latter brought only a few of his confidants.</p><p>In the villa.</p><p>After the two of them took a seat face to face, Song Guanghui said, “I need to tell you that investigating this issue won’t be easy, Tang Xiu. There are many strangers in Saipan at present, many of whom are terrifyingly powerful people from various forces.”</p><p>“What about those from the Big Three? Who is still in Saipan?” asked Tang Xiu.</p><p>“The Stygian Club,” answered Song Guanghui.</p><p>Tang Xiu furrowed his brows and sneered. ” <em>Hmph</em> . I’ve killed a lot of people from the Stygian Club, but I didn’t expect them to never stop with their malice. In fact, I have long been wanting to clean up this organization, but I always feel the time isn’t right yet. But since they still have their minions here, I’ll get rid of them first!”</p><p>“Hey, you can’t take them lightly!” said Song Guanghui hurriedly. “The people I sent to investigate the Stygian Club’s people told me they have quite a number of people here, nearly 100. Some of whom are wandering about from place to place and disappearing from time to time. It won’t be so easy to deal with them. Additionally, the other forces will also discover you easily once you lead your men to the Stygian Club.”</p><p>“Rest assured, Uncle Song! I won’t move unless a good opportunity appears.” Tang Xiu assured. “The most important issue now is to investigate whether there are people from SOE company in Saipan. If they are really here, then we will collect some interests from yesteryear first.”</p><p>“I’ll try my best to send some people to investigate it, mind you!” Song Guanghui squeezed a wry smile and said, “But I think you gotta assign some people from Tom Reggie too since there are some places inconvenient for my men to go into, but easy for Tom’s men to investigate. However, Tom has some enemies in Saipan too, so if possible, it’s best to help him completely control the underground forces in Saipan first.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
