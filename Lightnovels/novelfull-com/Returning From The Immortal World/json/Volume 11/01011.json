He had never heard of Tang Xiu since he never paid attention to the situation in China. At this time, however, they were just a fish on the chopping block. They had been poisoned, and the poison was spreading all over their bodies at an extremely fast rate, erasing any chance for them to fight the other party.</p><p>After a long while, he then looked back at Tang Xiu and asked in a deep voice, “Are you going to leave immediately if I pass my position on to Singluen?”</p><p>“Yes. I have no enmity with your Dark Shaman Clan.” Tang Xiu nodded. “I came here purely to help Singluen to sit on the top seat, so naturally, I won’t stay any longer after reaching my goal.”</p><p>Singtuo slowly asked, “What about the antidote?”</p><p>Tang Xiu flicked a porcelain bottle to Singtuo and said, “This is the antidote. But the poison in your system is very special and cannot be fully removed all at once. You’ll need to take the antidote once a year, though I’ve given enough of it to Singluen for 10 years. If you guys are loyal to him and don’t make things difficult for Singluen for a decade, I’ll naturally remove the poison from your system.”</p><p>What?!</p><p>The expression of Singtuo and the old man drastically changed, while several top clansmen of the Dark Shaman Clan looked pale. They glared at Tang Xiu, but dared not say anything for fear of offending him. They could sense that they were beginning to feel weaker and weaker at this time, even experiencing painful sensations in their bodies.</p><p>“Don’t misunderstand me. It’s not like I’m trying to control your life,” said Tang Xiu sternly. “It’s all for the sake of Singluen since he’s in a weak position in your clan. What can he do if you bully him after I leave? All things considered, you got only two options before you. One is to keep resisting so you can die without a grave, while the second option is to fully support Singluen to be the clan’s patriarch. The last option will not only give you benefits, but you can also witness your clan growing in power.”</p><p>The old man paced two steps forward to Tang Xiu and said, “Tang Xiu, isn’t it? You keep telling us today that letting Singluen take the patriarch seat will give us huge benefits. But what exactly are the benefits? Suppose that we exchanged the pills with the Sorcerer Stone, will the pill be as potent as Singluen said?”</p><p>“If you don’t believe it, you can exchange the pills with your Sorcerer Stone,” replied Tang Xiu calmly. “But I can only give you 1 pill for 200 Sorcerer Stones.”</p><p>“Come again?”</p><p>The old man’s face greatly changed to incredulity.</p><p>‘200 Sorcerer Stones are only worth 1 pill? It’s simply greedy—daylight robbery! It’s just treating us as profligate idiots?!’</p><p>“Mr. Tang, what are you…” interjected Singluen as he looked at Tang Xiu in surprise.</p><p>Tang Xiu raised his hand to interrupt him. He looked at the old man and said, “Well, the price is naturally not the exchange rate with Singluen of course. We are friends; I can’t just screw him over like that. But what am I to you? Do we even have a relationship? You want the pill, you must be prepared to get robbed, no?”</p><p>Singluen instantly understood Tang Xiu’s intention and shot a grateful glance at him. The more he knew Tang Xiu, the more he felt that this man was a huge benefit to him.</p><p>“You see, Singluen himself has gotten quite a lot of pills, though it’s just the advance payment I gave him.” Tang Xiu let out a dry smile. “I’m now waiting for him to pay me back with Sorcerer Stone. If he has taken over the Dark Shaman Clan’s patriarch seat, I don’t think it’d be a problem.”</p><p>The statement made Singluen shocked yet again, deepening his gratitude towards Tang Xiu. He realized that Tang Xiu was helping him to gain recognition from his clan. He suddenly realized that all the actions Tang Xiu did since coming to Bangkok were all for one purpose—to help him, be it by establishing a friendship with Bangkok’s underground leader Kanaja, or now after coming to his clan.</p><p>‘This is what a real brother is.’</p><p>He couldn’t help but compare Tang Xiu with his blood brother Singkuo, only to find that the latter was a villain with malice to him, while the former truly regarded him as a brother.</p><p>Tang Xiu himself was unaware of the thoughts Singluen had in mind. As he looked at his distracted face, he reminded, “It’s your call to take a shot, Singluen.”</p><p>The reminder made Singluen wake up from his daze. He shot a deep look at Tang Xiu before shifting his eyes to the top clansmen of his clan. “Grandpa, Father, and Clan Elders. You all have raised me and have seen me grow up. I’ve never harmed our clan’s interests since the beginning. Not now, not before. But Singkuo, my own blood brother, is always looking at me as a thorn in his side. He’s always wanting to remove me. I don’t wanna die, but be it strength or power, I’ve never been his equal at all. Resisting is the only thing I can do, which is the very reason why I relied on Mr. Tang’s strength.”</p><p>“I wouldn’t have dared imagined taking over the patriarch seat prior to this. But since I got the pill Mr. Tang refined himself, my cultivation has been progressing very fast; I am at least 10 times stronger than I used to be. The same thing happened to my subordinates, the five guardian elders. I’ve literally changed the circumstances of myself and my men, especially in cultivation. So I thought, why can’t I do so for the entire clan and propel the overall strength of our clan even more?”</p><p>“I promise you that I’ll definitely make everyone’s cultivation advance a level higher within 3 months after I become the Dark Shaman Clan’s patriarch. I’ll give the patriarch seat back to Father should I fail to achieve it, and I’ll exile myself, severing any relationship with the clan. That’s my promise.”</p><p>Singtuo was shaken and asked in a deep voice, “Are you serious?”</p><p>“I’m an adult. My words are my weight; I’ll take responsibility for what I said,” said Singluen with a dead serious face. “You can disown and do anything should there be any falsehood in what I do.”</p><p>Singtuo looked at his father who nodded to him in response. Then he immediately said, “Today I’m declaring that I step down as the clan patriarch and pass the seat to Singluen. From today onward, he is the Dark Shaman Clan’s patriarch. The ceremonial homage will be held 3 days from now. Also, Mr. Tang. Since Singluen is your friend, I hope you can stay to attend it.”</p><p>3 days later?</p><p>Tang Xiu slightly knitted his brows. He wanted to leave Bangkok as soon as possible as he needed to go back to Jingmen Island. He wanted to cast a secret are to move Gu Yan’er’s hidden exquisite pagoda to Nine Dragons Island.</p><p>Ring, ring, ring…</p><p>His mobile phone suddenly sounded at this moment.</p><p>He frowned yet again and took his mobile phone out. An inquisitive look suddenly flashed in his eyes as he saw the screen. He picked up the call, saying, “Something happened?”</p><p>“We got a situation here, Boss.” Tom Reggie’s voice came out of the phone. “Some people spread the news that some kind of treasure will be born in the waters near Nine Dragons Island. The treasure is rumored to be very beneficial for many practitioners. There have been many suspicious foreigners appearing in Saipan as of late. Most of them have contacted local shipping companies and have gone out to sea.”</p><p>Tang Xiu’s complexion changed as intense killing intent filled his eyes. Nine Dragons Island was located deep in the Pacific Ocean. A treasure being born there was simply impossible. The people who spread this news definitely harbored malice and simply wanted to expose Nine Dragons Island to all practitioners.</p><p>As of now, he had already learned that there were many practitioners on Earth. Although the number of Daoist cultivators were few, there were too many practitioners from other cultivation systems, such as those of the wizardry lineage, Buddhist schools, and the divergent races in the Dark Council. If all the practitioners in the world were to head to the vicinity of Nine Dragons Island, stating that the island would never be exposed was impossible.</p><p>By that time, if some people were to brew another sensational rumor that the treasure was on the island, he would become a public enemy and would have to face all the forces of the practitioners.</p><p>‘Goddammit! That damned Celestial Wizard Clan!’</p><p>Tang Xiu clenched his fists with eyes full of murderous intent. He had to admit how ruthless the scheme played by this Celestial Wizard Clan was. For the sake of aiding in their revenge against him, they lured practitioners from all over the world there. It was very likely that they planned to strike when all the forces, including those on Nine Dragons Island, had been damaged. At that time, the Celestial Wizard clansmen would come out and reap the benefits.</p><p>By now, everyone presented at the scene turned their attention to Tang Xiu, looking confused. They didn’t understand why such an enormous killing pressure erupted from him.</p><p>“Boss!”</p><p>Mo Awu came to Tang Xiu’s side and called out in a whisper with a concerned face.</p><p>“Relay my orders to our people. Hunt and assassinate any clansmen of the Celestial Wizard Clan and resort to any means to kill any of them who leave their land!” said Tang Xiu with an awe-inspiring voice. “The more you kill them, the more rewards you’ll get from me! Also, contact the world’s largest hitman organization. List a total bounty reward of 1 billion USD. I’ll pay 1 million USD for one Celestial Wizard life. The bounty will go until 1 billion USD is used up!”</p><p>Mo Awu’s complexion changed. They just had a battle with the Celestial Wizard Clan’s experts recently, defeating them completely until they miserably fled. But now, Boss issued such an order in a fury. The Celestial Wizard Clan had definitely done something that made him extremely furious.</p><p>“I’ll contact them right away, Boss.”</p><p>Similar killing intent filled Mo Awu’s eyes as he walked in strides toward the distance.</p><p>Tang Xiu then looked at Tang Guang and said in a deep voice, “Do you still remember the plan I ordered you to carry out? Go find Kuwako immediately and be sure to accomplish it. I give you 3 months to assemble a group of elite experts that can be dispatched at any time for me.”</p><p>“I’ll take my leave now, Grand Master.”</p><p>Tang Guang cupped his fists and replied before flashing toward the distance fast.</p><p>Tang Xiu spoke again, “An, Jin Shi’s team is under your command from now on. I don’t want any clansman of the Celestial Wizard Clan to appear outside of their clan’s territory! Also, pay attention to anyone from the Stygian Club. Assassinate any member of this club should you find them outside alone. Leave no traces so there aren’t future troubles.”</p><p>“Acknowledged!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
