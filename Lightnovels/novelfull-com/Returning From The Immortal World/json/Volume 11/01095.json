Tang Guang and Mo Awu’s group he sent there had already silenced all the informants found in the surroundings. Thus, now was the time to see the end of the battle between the Ravengale and Speeder.</p><p>“We’re ready, Boss!”</p><p>Tom Reggie returned with his two confidants with a stern face full of killing intent.</p><p>“Alright, tell me the situation about the Golden Cauldron organization first.” Tang Xiu nodded. “They will be our next target after we’re done with the Ravengale and Speeder. We’re going to eliminate all the forces in Saipan in these three days.”</p><p>Tom Reggie was shaken inwardly and respectfully replied, “The Golden Cauldron is led by a man named Kanajuo. He immigrated here about 10 years ago from Thailand and formed a very large and powerful syndicate here after more than 10 years of development. Also, the intel gathered by my men said that he’s very close to a large underground force in Thailand.”</p><p><em>‘Kanajuo from Thailand?’</em></p><p>Tang Xiu suddenly recalled Kanaja and immediately took out his mobile phone and dialed this man’s cell number. After his call got picked up, he straightly asked, “Hey, Kanaja. I got a situation I wanna ask you.”</p><p>“Please do ask, Mr. Tang.” Kanaja’s respectful voice came replying from the phone.</p><p>“I’m now in Saipan and there’s an underground force led by a man called Kanajuo.” Tang Xiu asked, “Is there any special relationship between him and you?”</p><p>“He’s my blood brother, Mr. Tang. He made quite a mess here several years ago; even I couldn’t ensure his safety. So, I secretly smuggled him out of Thailand. I’ve been helping him in secret, so he can develop his own force in Saipan,” replied Kanaja respectfully. “Ah, that’s right, the situation in Saipan is rather chaotic recently, so I just sent a group of people to help him.”</p><p>“I’ll send some people to deliver you my gift a few days later. But I want you to inform your younger brother to take his men and leave Saipan immediately,” said Tang Xiu. “All the underground forces in Saipan will be under one banner soon.”</p><p>Kanaja’s mind shifted upon hearing this and he said, “I’ll contact my brother at once, Mr. Tang. However, do you mind telling me who’s going to be the Kingpin of Saipan’s underground forces? Could it be that you…”</p><p>“Spare me your wild imagination. But I can tell you that Tom Reggie will be the leader of Saipan’s unified underground forces. He’s my subordinate. I need to have Saipan under my control due to some special reasons.”</p><p><em>‘All of it?’</em></p><p>Kanaja’s heart thumped hard. He could vaguely guess some profound meaning in Tang Xiu’s statement. One must know that no forces had been able to control the entire underground forces in Saipan. That would be true unless the person in charge of Saipan authority was a very powerful figure and also someone from Tang Xiu’s side.</p><p>After he thought up to this point, Kanaja immediately said, “Mr. Tang, if your subordinate wants to unify Saipan, would you like me to contact my younger brother to bring all his men under you? As far as I know, my little brother has a lot of men there, and the people I’ve sent there should be able to help you as well.”</p><p>Tang Xiu gave it a thought and said, “If so, then I accept. I’ll compensate your brother no matter how big the losses he and his men suffer later.”</p><p>“Alright, I’ll do as you instructed, Mr. Tang.” Kanaja chuckled.</p><p>Tang Xiu then hung up and looked at Tom Reggie. “I’ve cleared the situation with the Golden Cauldron. It’s a force formed by the younger brother of my friend. All the manpower under Golden Cauldron will be transferred under your management later, so you can use their men in the upcoming battles against the enemies.”</p><p>Disbelief covered Tom Reggie’s face, for he never thought that Tang Xiu actually had such a godly ability. He even had a close friend in Thailand that could directly influence the situation in Saipan and even made the Golden Cauldron organization to work for him.</p><p>At this moment, what he admired from Tang Xiu was no longer his strength, nor was a large number of powerful men under him, but his network.</p><p>However, he still didn’t feel at ease pertaining to the Golden Cauldron’s men, and said in a low voice, “But Boss, those Golden Cauldron’s men are not our own, wouldn’t it be complicated if new problems crop up due to their transfer? Please don’t get me wrong, Boss. I’m not questioning your ability, but Kanajuo is a ruthless and over suspicious man. I’m afraid…”</p><p>“Kanajuo’s big brother is the leader of the biggest underground force in Bangkok. He already knows the consequences of turning against me.” Tang Xiu interrupted him and lightly smiled. “They won’t dare to ruin our plans even if someone were to give them 100 more points of courage. I want you to use them as much as possible since you’ll become the Underground Lord of Saipan in the future. By then, you must control a lot of people and confidants, so the less your losses in the upcoming battles, the easier it will be for you to have control in the future.”</p><p>Tom Reggie secretly sighed inwardly upon hearing it. Then, he respectfully said, “I get you, Boss. And rest assured, I know what to do.”</p><p>“Alright, let’s wait for the news!” Tang Xiu nodded and said, “I’m sure it won’t take long for him to send some people to us. You can try to command his men later.”</p><p>“Understood!” answered Tom Reggie with admiration.</p><p>20 minutes later, as the battle at the Speeder’s HQ reached its climax, Tang Xiu suddenly received a call from Song Guanghui. A chilling light flashed in his eyes after hearing Song Guanghui’s news. “Roger that, Uncle Song.”</p><p>After hanging up, he turned to look at Tom Reggie and said in a deep voice, “Pass my order not to rush into action later. I just got the news that a mysterious group consisted of powerful people are heading to this place. If they are not from the Ravengale, then they must be the Speeder’s reinforcement.”</p><p>“How long until they get here, Boss?” asked Tom Reggie hurriedly.</p><p>“In about 20 minutes or so,” answered Tang Xiu.</p><p>Tom Reggie pondered for a moment and immediately said, “I’m afraid an accident will happen if the Golden Cauldron’s men bump into them on the way here. Would you like me to contact Kanajuo now to take precautions and prepare the countermeasure in advance?”</p><p>“Contact him quickly.” Tang Xiu nodded.</p><p>More than 4km away, in a building of more than ten floors, tens of mysterious people in black night suits and masks lined in a team, exuding thick killing aura. An old man with a scar on the corner of his mouth let out a satisfied smile while watching the fighting scene at the Speeder Union’s HQ through the high-powered telescope.</p><p>“Tell that Old Rat to get ready for action. We’ll strike the Ravengale’s people once those from the Speeder are destroyed. Hehe… I drifted around the Pacific for so many days due to some tricks by those Stygian’s assholes, only to get shit. The time is nigh to eradicate them from Saipan this time,” the old man murmured, then he glanced at the stalwart man in night black suit.</p><p>“I’ll pass your order immediately,” said the stalwart man in black suit respectfully.</p><p>The old man gently waved in response. A python the size of a bucket silently slithered from the distance and soon climbed up his right leg and wrapped around his waist. The old man gently touched its head and then let out a cold smile full of murderous intent.</p><p>As people said, the mantis stalks the cicada but is unaware of the oriole behind it.</p><p>The battle between the Ravengale and Speeder had alarmed a lot of forces. Especially after the Celestial Wizard Clan spread the rumors that there were treasures in the Pacific, attracting the practitioner forces around the world there. Some forces who were still staying near Saipan were perfectly aware that the situation here had turned into turbid waters, and thus had been thinking to earn some profits to make up for the loss caused by the false news.</p><p>At the Speeder Union’s HQ.</p><p>In the spacious building, blood was dripping out of Jameson’s body, the Speeder Union’s leader. Some of it was his enemies’ blood and the rest was from his own bleeding wounds. The last line of defense had been broken, leaving only five of his confidants alive out of the previously tens of people. Now, those 20-plus mysterious masked people who had been standing still previously got up to fight the enemy.</p><p>“Jameson, even if you have the help from the experts of St. James Company, you’re destined to die today! It’s best for you to work for the Stygian Club. Maybe you can save your ass here and even get rewards from the organization in the future.” A middle-aged man with a red cloak and wearing golden gloves flew up outside the building and stood mid-air. He looked at the bloody Jameson and smilingly spoke his piece, yet a mocking expression was evident on his face even though he persuaded the latter to submit.</p><p>Jameson retreated from a strong enemy and dodged to the corner. While using his weapons to protect himself, he furiously shouted, “You can babble arrogantly for now, Varela! But I’ll definitely rip your head off and piss on it when my reinforcement arrives!”</p><p>Varela, who was wearing a red cloak and golden gloves, was the Head of Stygian Club’s branch in Saipan. A smile crept up on the corner of his mouth as he shot a contemptuous gaze at Jameson. “Heh, your reinforcement must be those from St. James Company, no? Are you not aware that they haven’t contacted you for two days already? Why do you think we can act rampantly like this and besiege your Speeder Union?”</p><p>A chilling light overflowed in Jameson’s eyes. Just as he was about to retort, the black-masked old man suddenly appeared at the window, slightly trembling. His eyes embodied his seething killing intent as he growled. “So, it was your Stygian bastards who killed a group of experts of St. James Company two days ago? Is that man who left the Bloodthirst Insignia one of you?”</p><p>“Good God. What speed!!!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
