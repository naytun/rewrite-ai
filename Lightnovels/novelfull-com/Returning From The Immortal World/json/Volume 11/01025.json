Not to mention that Gu Yan’er had been seriously injured, so he personally placed the exquisite pagoda in the sea that was still covered by the island’s protective array so she could stay there and recuperate in peace.</p><p>As he returned to the assembly hall, Tang Xiu said with a deep voice, “And now, I’m announcing the establishment of four departments, which are also the traditional custom of developments used by orthodox monastic sects. These departments respectively are God-warfare Hall, Logistic Pavilion, Intelligence Edifice, and Assassination Hall.</p><p>“Mo Awu will be the Hall Master of the God-warfare Hall and will be in command of the army. This hall will the biggest armed force of our Tang Sect in the future and will absorb most of the recruited young blood to build a very strong army, as well as be responsible for opening up the territory in the future.</p><p>“Ji Chimei will hold the post of Logistic Pavilion’s Master and be in control of all the Tang Sect’s resources. I’ll formulate the resource allocation form later so you must provide a steady supply of cultivation resources to all the disciples of Tang Sect and ensure enough resources needed by all the disciples’ cultivation.</p><p>“Jin Shi will take responsibility as the Master of Intelligence Edifice and be responsible for establishing the intelligence service. Within two years, you must establish a comprehensive intelligence network all over Earth. You are to coordinate with the God-warfare Hall to weaken and eradicate the current largest intelligence agency, the Darkwind Organization.</p><p>“Tang An will serve as the Master of Assassination Hall. You can pick two assistants from all the members of the sect to train a large number of competent assassins. We have thousands of seedlings and you’re free to choose from them. I expect to see the results of their cultivation within two years.”</p><p>With the appointment of these four people, it meant that these four had become the top executives of the Tang Sect, responsible to manage a large number of disciples in the sect as well as its respective privileges and rights. The reason why Tang Xiu selected these four was due to his understanding of them and to develop the design plan according to their areas of expertise.</p><p>“Understood!”</p><p>The four people appeared in front of Tang Xiu under the numerous watchful eyes.</p><p>Nodding at them with satisfaction, Tang Xiu took four Command Tokens he personally refined and handed one to each. Then, he said with a deep voice, “The Tang Sect has just been established and only four divisions have been set up. But it’s just temporary since you can expect that each department will be branched out in the future. I hope that you’ll be devoted to your duty and forever be loyal to the Tang Sect and me.”</p><p>“Loyalty.”</p><p>“Loyalty.”</p><p>“Loyalty.”</p><p>“Loyalty.”</p><p>The four people clenched their right fists and placed them on their left chests.</p><p>Nodding with satisfaction, Tang Xiu gestured for them to retreat. Then, he said with a deep voice, “You’re all the earliest members of the Tang Sect and will become the leaders of the sect in the future. I expect you to make huge merits and contributions, and I wish to see all of you growing stronger.</p><p>“The books I’ve written in the Library Pavilion are no many, but there should be more than 200 books there. Among them contains knowledge on refining, alchemy, arrays, beast taming, body cultivation as well as soul ones, etc. Apart from carrying out your duty, you must allocate your time to read and enlighten yourself in the Library Pavilion.</p><p>“I’ll take many powerhouses in the sect with me to tear open the sky above our heads and leave for the Immortal World in the future—a place a billion times vaster than Earth. We’re all cultivators, and the path to immortality is the primary drive and foundation. However, I can’t wait for you that long to fight the battle in the Immortal World. Maybe a few years or a decade later, you can expect to see my final plan to be implemented.</p><p>“If you want to follow me to climb up to a higher plane; if you want to get to a more expansive stage; then your cultivation stage must reach the Spirit Formation Stage. It’s still very far away for you all, so I’ll provide you the resources and opportunities. However, the final results, whether you can grasp it or not, will depend on your own efforts.”</p><p>At this moment, all the Tang Sect’s people were shocked. They never knew of Tang Xiu’s final plan prior to this. They only knew that Tang Xiu had very mysterious and brilliant origins which would provide glorious achievements in the future should they follow him into the future. Yet, they never imagined that Tang Xiu’s ultimate goal on Earth was to fight their way out to the Immortal World.</p><p>But what shocked them the most was that they also had the opportunity to follow Tang Xiu to fight in the nigh impossible place that all the cultivators had been dreaming of ascending to.</p><p>After a long while, each department had taken their positions and began assuming their duties. Every member of the Tang Sect was very excited. They felt the pressure. Yet, it also served as a great motivation for them. It was because Sect Master Tang Xiu had been straightforward to them, and they also wished to follow him to rush into the Immortal World, even though they were expected to advance to the Spirit Formation Stage. Further, they had not much time left and the Spirit Formation Stage was a long journey to achieve with their current cultivation.</p><p>Two days later.</p><p>Tang Xiu was sitting cross-legged atop the palace roof in cultivation while facing the rising sun and absorbing the Purple Qi coming eastward into his body. After such a long period of cultivation and constantly promoting his strength, he had reached the full closure of perfection for the first stage of the Heavenly Art of Cosmic Genesis, the Star Tyrannical Body.</p><p>I must become stronger.</p><p>Tang Xiu slowly opened his eyes, which were full of ambition to become stronger. Regardless of the era, the world, or plane, survival of the fittest was the absolute rule. Only the strong deserved respect and had the right to speak.</p><p>The current him may look strong, but he was definitely not invincible. Tang Xiu was perfectly aware that there were still some fearsome characters residing on the Earth, such as the Nascent Soul Stage expert from the Whole Unitary Sect he just learned of a while ago.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>Several shadows flickered from the distance and appeared in the air in front of the palace in a few breaths. Mo Awen then walked step by step in the air until he came in front of Tang Xiu and respectfully reported. “All the materials have been transported, Sect Master. Our people also found two ships near the thirteenth deserted island. However, the people on those two ships obviously are not from the same group and they had a brief clash, apparently to probe each other’s strength.”</p><p>“Are these two groups the first few who have recently appeared near the barren island in the surroundings?” asked Tang Xiu.</p><p>“If we don’t count those two groups, we already got six, so we now have eight groups. Most of them have frictions but no mass fighting. Also, there’s no one from the Celestial Wizard Clan among them,” said Mo Awen.</p><p>“Heh, those Celestial Wizards are wanting to be the third party who profit from others’ battle, so they are obviously in the back at the ready.” Tang Xiu sneered. “Nevertheless, Jin Shi has hit them before and the Celestial Wizard Clan suffered a lot, losing over 100 people. Added with the hitmen from the various assassin organizations taking the bounty to hit them, they can only become a turtle.”</p><p>“What should be our next step then, Sect Master?” asked Mo Awen.</p><p>“Since we have transported all the material to the ninth deserted island, then we’re going to set out,” said Tang Xiu. “I’ll arrange that island to be the battlefield to fight the invading enemies. But there’s another thing you need to do. I want all those children who have broken through the late-stage of Qi Refining to be concentrated in one group. I’ll carry out special training for them for a few days.”</p><p>Mo Awen nodded and asked, “Should those who have advanced to the Foundation Establishment Stage be added apart from those who have advanced to the late-stage of Qi Refining?”</p><p>Tang Xiu was stunned and asked with a dull face, “What did you say?”</p><p>“It’s about those who are at the Foundation Establishment,” replied Mo Awen. “Sect Master is going to give special training to those children at the late-stage Qi Refining, but we also have those at the Foundation Establishment Stage. Would you like them to attend the special training too?”</p><p>“You mean some children have advanced to the Foundation Establishment Stage?” asked Tang Xiu in disbelief. “How is this possible? How can they break through to that stage in such a short time?”</p><p>“I was very surprised as well, Sect Master.” Mo Awu smiled and said, “But that’s the fact, and we have nine of them. The best one among them has even advanced to the mid-stage of Foundation Establishment.”</p><p>Tang Xiu got up all of a sudden and asked in a deep voice, “What’s his name?”</p><p>“28,” answered Mo Awen.</p><p>“What do you mean, 28?” Tang Xiu furrowed his brows.</p><p>“His name is 28, Sect Master.” Mo Awu grinned wryly said, “When Banshou brought him over, the others called him little beggar, little wild boy, etc. But he said his name is 28. I had no idea why he gave himself that name.”</p><p>“Where’s he now?” asked Tang Xiu.</p><p>“He’s in the training camp,” said Mo Awen. “Also, he has rarely participated in group training due to his particularity and spends most of his time cultivating alone in his room.”</p><p>“Gather the other eight who have advanced to the Foundation Established in one group for my special training.” Tang Xiu ordered in a deep voice. “And immediately summon this 28 to see me.”</p><p>Mo Awu took the order and immediately bolted to the training camp. When Tang Xiu appeared on the airfield on the island, Mo Awen brought a thin seven-odd-years-old boy lightning fast.</p><p>“He’s 28, Sect Master.”</p><p>Tang Xiu observed the thin boy in front of him and was able to determine that he indeed had advanced to the mid-sage of Foundation Establishment from his aura. To his disbelief, the boy’s aura was very stable and had stabilized his cultivation stage.</p><p>“You’re 28?”</p><p>The thin boy looked much more mature than his peers. His gesture and body language even similar to the adults. He cupped his right fist and placed it on his left chest, replying, “I’m 28, Boss.”</p><p>Squinting his eyes, Tang Xiu spent another minute observing him before nodding. “You’re great. The first to advance to the mid-stage of Foundation Establishment and make yourself stand out among the tens of thousands of people. That’s far beyond my expectations. But I have a question for you. Why did you give yourself 28 as a name?”</p><p>“It’s been three years since I was four until seven, and I now have saved a total of 28 yuan although I barely had enough to eat and wear warm clothes. If I could have saved 28 yuan when I was four, my grandma and sister wouldn’t have starved to death then. So, my name is 28. I want to remember this number forever.”</p><p>Tang Xiu silently nodded and then said, “Gimme your left hand.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
