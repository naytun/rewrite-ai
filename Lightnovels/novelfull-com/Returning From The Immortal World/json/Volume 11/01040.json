The pursuit and homicide scene on the streets of Beijing would surely attract the attention of countless people. More so that this incident was just the beginning, premediating the more horrible killings in the capital.</p><p>“There’s one piece of advice for you, my friend. Cease all the business dealings you have with the Fans. You must come out clean no matter how big your losses are.”</p><p>Tang Xiu immediately hung up after delivering this line. He didn’t bother to think about any decisions Qin Shaoyang and his father would make.</p><p>He sensed Cadaver Qi at the scene of the murders and was sure that those who left this cadaveric energy were likely to be one of the Second Young Master’s group. Should this be proven, the Fan Family could expect a calamity to befall upon them while dragging along all those who had a deep connection with them.</p><p>****</p><p>Beijing, Dragon Hamlet Villa Complex.</p><p>Of the most luxurious villa in this complex was a European-style Kingview villa boasting four floors with extravagant interior decoration. In the spacious study filled with poetry paintings, Qin Shaoyang hung up the phone. In front of him were a middle-aged man and another young man looking at him with a dissatisfied look.</p><p>The man with a thin figure and wisdom-filled eyes was Qin Xuefeng, the Big Boss of Qin Group with a net worth easily reaching 50 billion yuan and one of the top billionaires in China. Although he had some dissatisfaction with his son, Qin Shaoyan, for taking a call at this time, he lit a Cuban cigar and took a few deep puffs before speaking, “Shaozhi will serve as a government official as usual, but what about you, Shaoyang? Tell me your opinion about what we should do now.”</p><p>“I think we must draw the line and cease all of our business partnerships with the Fan Family.” Qin Shaoyang looked up and replied with a deep voice, “We must sever any future connections with them as well.”</p><p>BAM…</p><p>“NONSENSE!” Qin Xuefeng yelled, “I thought you’d made great progress in these years, but to think that you’re so dumb in this matter is too much! Don’t you know our cooperation with the Fans is worth nearly 10 billion yuan? It’s 10 billion, I tell you! And you want it to stop just like that? Our family will definitely suffer a great loss, don’t you know that?”</p><p>Qin Shaozhi frowned and voiced his opinion afterward, “We have invested 10 billion yuan in this cooperation project, Shaoyang. It will be a big blow to us if we quit now. Even the board of directors will definitely be against it. Unless Father takes a hard stance, it will be hard to convince them otherwise if we don’t give them a sound reason.”</p><p>Qing Shaoyang raised his phone and bitterly said, “Dad, Big Brother, do you know who just called me?”</p><p>“Who?” asked Qin Shaozi curiously.</p><p>Qin Xuefeng likewise frowned, although he looked puzzled.</p><p>“Tang Xiu,” answered Qin Shaoyang.</p><p>“Tang Xiu? Which Tang Xiu? I…” blurted Qin Xuefeng. But he didn’t finish his line and abruptly stopped. A handsome face appeared in his mind and his heartbeat sped up. Then, he said, “Did you say he’s the one from the Tang Family of Beijing? The owner of the Magnificent Tang Corporation, famously hailed as China’s Young Divine Doctor?”</p><p>“That’s him, indeed. My answer is actually his words,” said Qin Shaoyang with a forced smile.</p><p>A solemn look now covered Qin Xuefeng’s face and he said with a deep voice, “Can you repeat his words word-per-word, Shaoyang?”</p><p>After Qin Shaoyang repeated Tang Xiu’s words verbatimly, he finally said, “Dad, I know about Tang Xiu’s nature a bit since we’re both friends and partners. He may be 21 years old this year, but he’s very mature and steady. Everything he says is always through careful thinking. Calling me all of a sudden means that he knows that we have a deep cooperative relationship with the Fans, the reason why he disclosed some info to me.”</p><p>Qin Xuefeng got up from his chair and paced back and forth in the study while smoking the cigar. Hesitation could be seen on his resolute face. From Tang Xiu’s call just now, he could faintly notice something—the Fan Family would surely be in a big mess that would also drag the cooperation between the two families to the bottom. Should his family be dragged down due to a certain issue, then they would be in for quite a big trouble.</p><p>However, they had invested tens of billions of yuan! Even if they immediately issued an order to cease the cooperation and recovered some of the scraps as much as possible, a final loss of at least five billion yuan was still very likely.</p><p>What should I do?</p><p>Qin Xuefeng stopped by the window and watched the scenery outside. Then, he suddenly asked, “Can I talk to him in person?”</p><p>“That will be very difficult, Dad,” replied Qin Shaoyang bitterly. “Tang Xiu hung up right after he told me that, meaning that he doesn’t want to speak any longer. I’m afraid he won’t tell you anything more even if you call him.”</p><p>Sighing in response, Qin Xuefeng helplessly said, “There’s no choice but dropping it, then. The Fans are definitely facing big trouble since he himself gave the news. We’ll fully dissolve our cooperation with the Fans and withdraw all the capital we’ve invested as fast as possible no matter how big our losses.”</p><p>“Don’t you think the decision is too hasty, Dad?” Qin Shaozhi interjected quickly. “You made such a big decision just because of Tang Xiu’s call? We’ll be completely offending the Fan Family should nothing happen to them later.”</p><p>“There are things you don’t understand, Shaozhi.” Qin Xuefeng said, “The Tangs of Beijing are one of the most powerful families in China. Be it their wealth, privileges, or network, it’s easy for them to crush the Fan Family. It’s best to have a deep relationship with such a colossus—something I’ve long been wanting to do, yet unable to achieve. But Shaoyang finally did.</p><p>“After I learned that Shaoyang became friends with Tang Xiu, I sent some people to investigate him in secret. The results were very shocking. Tang Xiu has become the most outstanding offspring of the Tangs. In particular was the fact that he cured his own father, Tang Yunde, which made his position in the Tang Family soar so high that even the Tang Family’s patriarch cares a lot about him.</p><p>“Our family may have gambled too big and we lost the bet, though it isn’t unrecoverable in the truest sense. We may lose five billion yuan, a blow that our family must admit. But it’s much more worthwhile to deepen the relationship between Shaoyang and Tang Xiu.”</p><p>The light of wisdom in Qin Xuefeng’s eyes turned more intense. As he stopped talking, he took several puffs of his cigar and then sighed. “Regardless of the news Tang Xiu gave us being reliable or not, Shaoyang has unreserved trust in him, and so shall our family trust in Shaoyang since he can secure Tang Xiu’s friendship. But if… the whole thing is proven true and the Fans fall to the bottom, our family can steer off of any connection with them. This will definitely be our wisest choice ever.”</p><p>“Your analysis is sound, Dad. But I still have a few questions. Can Tang Xiu really inherit the seat of Tang Family’s patriarch from the current old patriarch in the future?”</p><p>“Your vision is too narrow, son.” Qin Xuefeng shook his head and said, “I don’t think the patriarch seat enters Tang Xiu’s eyes at all. Do you know how much wealth he has now?”</p><p>“How much is his wealth? Don’t tell me his private property exceeds 10 billion yuan?” asked Qin Shaozhi with a confused look.</p><p>“You gotta update yourself faster if you wanna go further in the future, Shaozi.” Qin Xuefeng derided him. “From my previous investigation, Tang Xiu has tens of billions of yuan in private property. In just the recent half-year, his company, the Magnificent Tang Corporation keeps moving upward. Not to mention the lucrative profits from this company’s extremely popular products, just the revenue from the New Metro development project in the Star City has raked in so much fun from the sale of its internal purchase.”</p><p>“How is this possible?” asked the shocked Qin Shaozhi.</p><p>“Why impossible?” Qing Xuefeng sighed. “The demands for the Magnificent Tang Corporation’s products far outstrip the supply in the market. However many they can produce, the market is still starving for their products. Such an enormous lucrative situation is something that all the businesspeople are very jealous of. Also, do you even know how many parties are partnering with the Magnificent Tang Corporation in the Star City’s New Metro development project?”</p><p>“I dunno about that either.” Qin Shaozhi shook his head.</p><p>“I’ll give you the rundown about it, Big Brother!” Qin Shaoyang interjected. “The Star City’s New Metro construction project is being developed by a total of seven powers: The Bai and Chu Houses of Beijing, Star City’s Long Family, Jingmen Island’s Ouyang Family, Haiqing Province’s Miao Family, and a mysterious man with unknown origin, Shao Mingzhen. The wealth and power of each of these seven parties are in the billions of yuan. There’s also one thing that I don’t think Dad is aware of.”</p><p>“Ah, what is it?” asked Qin Shaozhi with a puzzled look.</p><p>“Back when these seven forces joined to develop the Star City’s New Metro, Tang Xiu still wasn’t considered as a member of Beijing’s Tang Family. He didn’t know that he was an offspring of the Tang Family at that time, yet he could still collaborate with the other six parties relying only on his own personal abilities and even took the leadership role.”</p><p>Gasp…</p><p>Qin Shaozhi was so shocked and awed by his younger brother’s explanation that he couldn’t help but gasp. He had heard that some people had fearsome talent, but one with such terrifying talent was something he had never heard of. This was simply… too fearsome.</p><p>Qin Xuefeng himself was a bit shocked and sighed after a long while. “Tang Xiu’s power is more than that. Rumors have it that the Amur Tiger, Dongbei Hu was killed by him. Words flying around said that the Tang Family was able to defeat the Yaos, also due to Tang Xiu’s involvement. You know Zhang Yueming, right? He’s an old buddy of mine for many years, and even he said when I was drinking with him that the future world will definitely belong to Tang Xiu.”</p><p>Qin Shaozhi fell into silence. He may not buy the words of his younger brother, Qin Shaoyang, but it was a different case with his own father. Both of them saying all these only meant that Tang Xiu was truly fearsome and terrifying.</p><p>After putting off the cigar, Qin Xuefeng waved and said, “Alright then. Shaoyang, you’re to help me cease all the business partnership with the Fans. Also, see if you can contact Tang Xiu and get more useful info from him. And Shaozi, you can go back first since you don’t know how to run the business!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
