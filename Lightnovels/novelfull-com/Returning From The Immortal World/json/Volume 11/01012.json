She quickly made a gesture to Jin Shi’s team to immediately follow her.</p><p>Tang Xiu looked straight at Singtuo and the old man, saying, “I know your clan once belonged to the Celestial Wizard Clan, but the blood feud between me and the Celestial Wizard Clan will only end until one of us is gone. I want your clan to make a stance now. If you still want to come back to them, then we’re enemies. If you have no friendship with them, then you’re my friend!”</p><p>Singtuo’s eyes sparkled and he replied in a deep voice, “The ancestors of Dark Shaman Clan were chased and hunted by the Celestial Wizard Clan’s experts in the past. Many of our clansmen died in their hands as well. If there’s any relationship between us and them, it should be as enemies and never as friends!”</p><p>One of the top clansmen of the Dark Shaman Clan, a white-haired old man echoed. “It’s as Patriarch said. The Celestial Wizard Clan once hunted our ancestors and damaged our lineage greatly. It has been so many years, but we have never forgotten this hatred. Pity that our clan is too weak compared to them, or we could’ve sought justice for our ancestors.”</p><p>Singluen took a deep breath and solemnly stated. “What my father and everyone else said is correct, Mr. Tang. We never had any good impression toward the Celestial Wizard Clan, and have been wanting them destroyed instead. We won’t meddle in the blood feud between you and them. But if you provide us with many pills by which we can enhance the strength of the entire clan greatly, we can even help you in the future should you need our assistance.”</p><p>“SINGLUEN!”</p><p>Singtuo’s expression changed and he shouted. He didn’t want the Dark Shaman Clan to be involved in the blood feud between Tang Xiu and the Celestial Wizard Clan. Although he knew how close Singluen and Tang Xiu were, he still shouted to prevent it.</p><p>The old man, Singtuo’s father, however, looked surprised and slowly said, “Tuo’er, I approve Singluen’s suggestion. Our clan has never been able to seek justice for our ancestors. It’s all because we’re weak. But if our clansmen’s strength grows by leaps and bounds, I don’t see any reason why we can’t help Mr. Tang later.”</p><p>Singtuo quickly retorted. “But father, this matter is…”</p><p>The old man raised his hand to interrupt him and said to Tang Xiu, “Mr. Tang, we need the pills, but I hope you can exchange it with our clan at a fair price. I’m certain that you’ve heard from Singluen that the amount of Sorcerer Stones our clan has is but a few, so I hope you won’t cut us off from this resource.”</p><p>“You can rest assured about that. I’ve already considered it.” Tang Xiu nodded. “Also, I hope that all the Dark Shaman Clan’s senior members can keep this matter a secret. I don’t want my men’s hunt to kill the Celestial Wizard clansmen to be affected because of you.”</p><p>The old man raised his hand and vowed in a deep voice. “The Dark Shaman Clan will keep your secret as long as I’m alive. Should any of us violate it, they’ll be charged with treason! However, there’s one presumptuous request I’d like to ask you. And I hope Mr. Tang can help us.”</p><p>“Speak then!” Tang Xiu nodded.</p><p>“Singli is a senior member of our clan, and his strength is second only to my son, Singtuo,” said the old man. “He has betrayed the clan and is a sinner. If your men find his trail during their missions, I hope you can tell us promptly.”</p><p>“No problem. I’ll tell you his whereabouts should we find any news of Singli,” replied Tang Xiu. “Also, I can’t attend the ceremonial homage for the patriarch seat coronation. I also hope that we can be friends and not enemies in the future.”</p><p>“Hmm.”</p><p>The members of Dark Shaman Clan nodded together. They may not like Tang Xiu since many of their clansmen died in Tang Xiu’s hands, but their lives were in Tang Xiu’s hands now, and it was very likely that they and the clan would obtain many benefits from him in the future. It was just natural that they didn’t dare to act otherwise.</p><p>A few minutes later, in order to fulfill his promise, Singluen asked his father to open the clan’s vault and hand over all the Demon Stones he owed Tang Xiu. He even gifted the Radiance Bloodstone to Tang Xiu to thank him for his help.</p><p>****</p><p>Bangkok, at the coconut plantation.</p><p>After Tang Xiu and Mo Awu returned to this place, he found that Zuo Daquan was supervising his men as they cleaned up the rubble. Upon seeing his sweaty and tired face, Tang Xiu took a porcelain bottle from his interspatial ring, then took a drop of Body Tempering Liquid and put it in the bottle before coming before him.</p><p>“Mr. Zuo.”</p><p>Upon seeing Tang Xiu’s arrival, Zuo Daquan immediately looked pleasantly surprised and a bit respectful, saying, “You’re back, Mr. Tang. Kanaja has just left, but he left a message for you inviting you to his place if you have time.”</p><p>“I already called him on the way here,” replied Tang Xiu. “Anyway, I need to leave soon since there’s an urgent matter, so I won’t be able to visit him. Also, I’d like to borrow your place to do something and will immediately leave after that.”</p><p>“Here?” Zuo Daquan’s expression turned strange. “But this place is already a ruin, Mr. Tang. I’ve settled Qing’er and my two grandsons in the hotel. May I know why do you want to borrow my place?”</p><p>“I need that underground warehouse of yours,” replied Tang Xiu. “As for what I wanna do, you’ll know after I’m done.”</p><p>“Since Mr. Tang needs it, please use it freely,” said Zuo Daquan hurriedly. “Also, I’ll order someone to prepare daily necessities if you’d like to stay here for a long time. They will also serve you meals on time if you’d like to.”</p><p>“There’s no need for all that.” Tang Xiu waved his hand and said, “I won’t be here for a long time. It’ll take up to two days at the most. I’ll leave Bangkok and return to China once I’m done, so there’s one thing I need your assistance with.”</p><p>“Please tell me!” said Zuo Daquan respectfully.</p><p>“You also know that I and my men came to Bangkok illegally on a smuggling ship. I’m done handling all the things I need to do here and am in a hurry to return to China directly by plane. Can you get me a temporary passport and arrange it at the airport?”</p><p>“It’s quite difficult to apply for passports here, Mr. Tang. You’re not a Thai, and the passport you hold is a Chinese one,” said Zuo Daquan looking a bit embarrassed. “Also, I don’t know anyone at the Airport, so I can’t help you with that. But…”</p><p>“But what?” asked Tang Xiu.</p><p>“But Kanaja may be able to deal with that,” said Zuo Daquan. “You don’t need to buy a ticket, neither will you need a passport and other documents. He can also send the plane for you and your men.”</p><p>Kanaja?</p><p>Being reminded of this man’s identity, Tang Xiu nodded. “Then help me contact Kanaja about this matter! Also, get however much gold you can as fast as possible in the next two days. I’ll give a magic tool if you get enough of it before I leave.”</p><p>“No problem!”</p><p>It was a happy surprise for Zuo Daquan. He immediately grabbed his mobile phone and dialed Kanaja’s phone number.</p><p>Tang Xiu then came to the underground warehouse and entered it directly. The ventilation and lighting were excellent, so he had no problem to adapt to the environment.</p><p>“Come out!”</p><p>He took out the Demon God Spirit Devourer Cauldron from his interspatial ring and then placed it in the middle of the warehouse. He had hoarded a lot of precious ores in the ring, so the first thing he needed to do was to extract the gold essence.</p><p>“True Fire!”</p><p>As Tang Xiu cast the technique, the True Fire was ignited under the cauldron. He then continuously threw the massive piled-up gold in the warehouse into the furnace.</p><p>Melting the gold itself was a very simple process since one just needed to burn all its impurities, leaving only the gold essence. With the powerful True Fire, the gold would be easily smelted and leave a trace of gold essence. After a long time, all the gold in the warehouse had been smelted, leaving only liquid gold essence the size of a table tennis ball floating in the center of the furnace.</p><p>“Refining immortal tools with this little gold essence is nothing but a ridiculous dream. But this amount is enough to manufacture quite a number of magical tools. The Everlasting Feast Hall has a lot of people now, but weapons and tools are few in number. Except for the immortal swords Ji Chimei refined for Mo Awu and his team, there are only a few magical tools for the rest. Not to mention the magic weapons and tools needed by those children after they have grown and can enter combat. The number will be huge.</p><p>“If this gold essence is well distributed to complement other material, it should be enough to refine 20 magic tools. Yet, it’s still too few. It seems like I need to rely on Zuo Daquan and Kanaja’s power to get me a constant supply of refining materials.”</p><p>Gold, silver, bronze and pig iron respectively could be refined into gold, silver, copper, and iron essences.</p><p>The mineral deposits of these four ores were the easiest to find on Earth nowadays, and they were also the most common materials to refine magic tools and weapons. As long as the precious ores were added into the smelted essence, a lot of magic weapons could be manufactured.</p><p>Tang Xiu fished out his mobile phone. After finding that he got a signal in the underground warehouse, he immediately dialed Zuo Daquan and Kanaja, telling them that he needed a lot of gold, silver, bronze, and pig iron. Afterward, he used the precious ores in his interspatial ring and began refining some magic tools.</p><p>“Sword is the most common weapon for cultivators. Back when in the Immortal World, I also trained a group of powerful men excelling in swordsmanship.”</p><p>As Tang Xiu himself had mastered sword formations, the sword array he had developed in the past was able to make his men produce fearsome might by themselves. The sword formation he developed could be formed by ten, hundred, thousand, or even ten thousand people. He even had developed an array that was suitable to be performed by one million immortals.</p><p>“If Zuo Daquan and Kanaja can send a lot of gold, silver, bronze, and iron, I can refine more than a hundred magic swords in two days.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
