His eyes were full of fear. Even in his dreams, he never expected those eight experts he took great efforts and energy to cultivate were killed in a flash. The blood blotted over the sky as though the blood river in hell, and he couldn’t wait for more to escape.</p><p>“So strong!”</p><p>He was now finally sure this young man had enough power to kill him since his subordinates had strength on par with him.</p><p>Staring at Tang Xiu, Demonfreak shouted in a heavy voice, “Who exactly are you? There’s no enmity between us, why do you want to eliminate my side?”</p><p>” <em>Hmph</em> . You were so full of spirit and vigor when you ordered your men to kill me just now.” Tang Xiu sneered. “How could you forget it in just a flash, huh?”</p><p>“It’s you who wanted to kill first, so I ordered my men… what I did is justifiable self-defense.” The old argued man hastily. “Sir, you’re very powerful and I’m likely not your opponent. You even have very strong subordinates and most of them are Golden Core Stage experts. But who exactly are you and why do you want to kill us?”</p><p>“Hehe, is there a need for you to know who we are, huh? Zero.” Tang Xiu chuckled and said, “All the enemies that have been trapped inside my Bloodseed Array came to one end—death. If you want a reason, I can tell you that those trying to seize control over the underground forces in Saipan must die!”</p><p>Demonfreak stared dumbly for a second. Then, he furiously shouted, “Fuck it. We’re not Saipan locals nor do we have any thoughts to control Saipan’s underground forces. I have enmity with the Stygian Club and also a new grudge over the old with that damned Iron Raven. I brought my men here with one purpose—to kill Iron Raven and slay anyone from the Stygian Club!”</p><p>“Is that so?”</p><p>Shooting him a strange look, Tang Xiu then let out a bit of regret on his handsome face and sighed. “Well, it seems like I shouldn’t kill you now that I know your purpose since the Stygian Club and I have deep enmity. Only, that Cadaveric Beast next to you is enough the reason to kill you.”</p><p>Demonfreak furrowed his brows and asked, “Just for that reason?”</p><p>“I’m not a saint. And naturally, I rarely sympathize with the poor state of the world and the people who live in it,” said Tang Xiu. “I just understand the truth that life and death are decreed by fate, and so are wealth and destiny, which are matters of destiny. Only, you slaughtered so many people just because you have formidable power. Some conclusions say that one who does so will be spellbound and degenerate into the demonic path. For you to continue living in the world will likely lead to more people suffering in the future. Most of whom will die in your hands and to this Cadaveric Beast.”</p><p>Demonfreak now looked desperate. He couldn’t tell whether Tang Xiu’s reason was really true or false, but he was sure that this man would never let him go today. Taking a deep breath, he instantly retreated back while releasing the eight flags, angrily shouting, “Let me go! I give you my word I won’t kill anyone—not even one in the future—otherwise, I’ll make you pay a heavy price even if I die in your hands today.”</p><p>“Are you threatening me, by chance?” Tang Xiu gave him a contemptuous look in response. Just as he was about to act, he suddenly recalled something and immediately looked at the geezer and asked, “I can spare your wretched life if you can answer my question.”</p><p>Demonfreak geezer’s complexion changed and he hurriedly asked, “What is it? Just ask. I won’t hide anything as long as it’s within my knowledge.”</p><p>Any secret was worth revealing if it means that he could secure his life.</p><p>“You should’ve been in Saipan for some time, yes?” asked Tang Xiu. “There was a fight here a few days ago. It was a group of mysterious people who ambushed some cultivators. I can spare your life if you can tell me the origin of these mysterious people.”</p><p>The old man tried to recall for a while. He felt a bit relieved when he saw Tang Xiu’s eyes and then spoke with a solemn expression, “I don’t think anyone can answer your question if you ask others. It was a coincidence that I witnessed the whole scene, actually. It seems those cultivators are your men, right?”</p><p>“Correct. They are my men.” Tang Xiu didn’t hide it and nodded.</p><p>“Reasonably speaking, your men are very strong.” The old man sighed. “But they just bumped into some top-rank bunch of SOE. They are all genetic warriors who have undergone many genetic modifications. But the one who leads and commands of these genetic warriors is the most outstanding genius of House Dolan—Angelo Dolan.”</p><p><em>‘The House of Dolan?’</em></p><p>A chilling light flashed in Tang Xiu’s eyes. He slowly extended a finger and asked in a deep voice, “Tell me, where are those genetic warriors of SOE led by this Angelo Dolan now? You only have this chance, else you’ll turn into dead meat soon. Then I’ll search your memory with the Soul Scouring Art to find the answer I want.”</p><p><em>‘Soul Scouring Art?!!’</em></p><p>Demonfreak couldn’t help but shiver. He had heard from Dao Master Poison that some evil cultivators in China were proficient in the Soul Scouring Art—a method that went against the natural order. It could scour all the memories of the enemy, no matter whether they were alive or had just died.</p><p><em>‘Is he… that kind of… evil cultivator?’</em></p><p>He drew in a deep breath and replied, “I don’t have any enmity with those guys from SOE, and we even cooperate in some aspects. But that genius of House Dolan owes me a favor, so he met me after they arrived in Saipan, which is why I know their whereabouts. If you want to find them, go search the Pacific waters. They were tracking several cultivators who went to the sea several days ago—otherwise, the Speeder Union wouldn’t have ended up with such a miserable end like this.”</p><p>Tang Xiu frowned and said, “What do you mean? Are you saying either the SOE or the House Dolan is related deeply to the Speeder Union?”</p><p>“Don’t you already know the Speeder is controlled by House Dolan?” asked the old man with an odd expression. “The SOE is also affiliated with them. Those people from Ravengale—which is affiliated to the Stygian Club—must have received the news that Angelo Dolan brought the SOE’s genetic warriors to the sea, thus the reason they dared to attack the Speeder’s HQ.”</p><p>At this moment, a horrifying aura erupted from Tang Xiu, making Demonfreak greatly startled. He couldn’t bear to hold on and retreated tens of meters. He could sense that Tang Xiu was at least ten times more powerful than him, given the intensity of the erupted aura. It would be absolutely easy for Tang Xiu to kill him.</p><p>“Hey, you just said you’ll spare me if I can answer your question!” shouted the old man rapidly.</p><p>“I can spare you, but I must control your life,” replied Tang Xiu apathetically. “I want you to sign a Soul Pact. I’ll let you go and won’t constrain your actions in the future if you agree. But if you refuse, you’ll expose everything that happened today later, so it’s too difficult for me to leave you alive.”</p><p>“Are you going back on your own fucking words? You really got no integrity!” roared Demonfreak.</p><p>“I haven’t gone back on my word,” said Tang Xiu indifferently. “I just said that I’ll let you go, but I must have your life under my control in case you expose anything about me after you leave.”</p><p>” <em>Hmph</em> , even if I sign a Soul Pact with you, do you think it can stop me from spreading the things you just did?” Demonfreak sneered. “That’s nothing but an excuse. You just want me to give up resisting and then you can freely oppress and exploit me.”</p><p><em>Whoosh!</em></p><p>Kuwako’s figure flickered and instantly appeared at Tang Xiu’s side. Her pretty eyes swept over the Demonfreak geezer and contemptuously said, “Our Sect Master doesn’t need any excuses if he wants to kill you. Just a flick of his fingers is enough to make your soul scatter, no need for him to play any scheme on you. You’re called Demonfreak geezer, aren’t you? Let me tell you, the Soul Pact my Sect Master is offering you won’t harm you, but give you huge fortune instead, for I’m a living example…”</p><p>Demonfreak geezer knitted his brows and asked, “You also signed a Soul Pact with him? What kind of form does this thing exist, exactly?”</p><p>“The Soul Pact is like a seed planted in your body by Sect Master and will act like a bomb. Your soul will scatter and you’ll die tragically as long as the Sovereign wishes it so. Hence, you must obey the Sect Master, only then can you live in peace.”</p><p>“Yet, you still dared to sign a Soul Pact with him even though it’s that horrifying?” The Demonfreak geezer retorted incredulously.</p><p>” <em>Hmph</em> . I was nothing but a bug a year and a half ago, even though I was quite a powerful martial artist.” Kuwako sneered. “But in just a year and a half, I’ve been continuously breaking through in cultivation from martial artist to be a Golden Core Stage expert. It was all thanks to Sect Master who helped me remove the obstacles, so I can train lots of elite warriors I call my own. Hence the reason why I obtained a prominent identity, status, strength, and wealth—all in all, I’ve nearly obtained everything. And yet, Sovereign never makes things difficult for me, nor has he done anything disadvantageous to me event though he can control my life and death. If you want to get a huge chance like this, take it and learn to follow and obey orders. The benefits you’ll probably get will be much more than you yourself are striving for.”</p><p>Demonfreak geezer stared fixedly at Kuwako. After a long time, he finally asked with difficulty, “You have power at Golden Core Stage, but you’re not Chinese and you’re not a cultivator from that country either.”</p><p>“Cultivators don’t divide people by the race, regardless of nationality,” replied Kuwako. “Though I’m a Japanese, Sect Master treats me like his own family.”</p><p><em>‘A Japanese, yet a cultivator in China?’</em></p><p>Demonfreak turned his head to look at Tang Xiu in disbelief. His lips squirmed a few times before raising his thumb and praised. “You’re really amazing, Sir.”</p><p>“Kuwako has told you a lot, so I won’t bother with any nonsensical talk,” said Tang Xiu indifferently. “You have two ways out now. Submit and sign a Soul Pact, or to be killed by me here and now, so I can make use of your Golden Core energy to help me refine much better Sanguine Pills with a stronger effect.”</p><p>The Demonfreak geezer drew in a deep breath and said, “There’s something I’d like to know first. If I were to choose to submit to you, what do you want me to do later? I can make my choice at once if you can answer this.”</p><p>“Don’t you have enmity with the Stygian Club?” asked Tang Xiu back apathetically. “I need you to infiltrate them. When I get rid of the Stygian Club in the future, you and I can collaborate from the inside and outside then. Also… that includes the SOE company, and even the existence behind it—the House Dolan.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
