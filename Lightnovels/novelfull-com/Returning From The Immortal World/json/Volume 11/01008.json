Each of them was a wizardry expert and none were inferior to either Singluen or Singkuo.</p><p>As the clan’s patriarch, Singtuo was always composed and indifferent, but everyone present was able to tell that he was rather restless and had a vague killing aura leaking out of his body.</p><p>What exactly is going on? What could be the reason the patriarch was so restless? He didn’t even hesitate to summon all the clansmen from the outside, and appeared vigilant like they were about to face possible dangers?</p><p>“Patriarch.”</p><p>A burly, strong middle-aged man with seething murderous aura came in from the outside. His eyes were filled with chilling light as he came to the front of Singtuo.</p><p>Singtuo’s expression shifted, and he asked in a deep voice, “How’s the situation? Any change of their movements?”</p><p>“Their convoy just moved a few minutes ago. They’re coming to our clan’s location.” The man began reporting, “We can expect them to arrive at our gate in ten minutes. Also, I’ve issued an order that Singluen and those who follow him in entering the gate must hand over their weapons.”</p><p>Nodding wordlessly, Singtuo’s eyes then shifted to the several high-up clansmen in the ancestral hall. He then said in a deep voice, “I know that you all should be confused by the situation as to why I summoned you all of a sudden, as well as why our clan appears to be ready for battle. It’s time to inform you all that our Dark Shaman Clan is currently facing misfortune. One of us has been colluding with foreign enemies. It’s all in an attempt to drive me out, for me to step down from my position as the clan’s patriarch to replace me with the unworthy descendant of mine, none other than my own blood, Singluen!”</p><p>“What?!”</p><p>“How is this possible, Patriarch?!”</p><p>“That’s right! We have seen Young Master Singluen grow up. We are well aware of his nature and personality. There’s no way he would dare to act that rash even if his courage grew a hundred times! Did you… are you not mistaken?</p><p>“Are you sure you didn’t misunderstand that child, Patriarch? He has been cultivating diligently all these years and has been absolutely loyal to the clan! His cultivation is much weaker than Singkuo, and he’s not as adept at strategy; why would he covet your Patriarch seat?”</p><p>“I’m sure there must be some misunderstanding between you both! Let’s just ask Young Master Singluen about it openly once he comes here. He’s your own blood no matter what. He knows the customs and rules of our clan–that he must have formidable strength if he wants to be our clan’s patriarch.”</p><p>“…”</p><p>Several top clan members expressed their views with looks of disbelief on their faces.</p><p>A sad and sorrowful look flashed in Singtuo’s eyes, and he addressed their questions in a heavy voice, “I know that you found what I just told you hard to believe. The truth is, if my guess is correct, he has already killed Singkuo. I sent Singli and 13 Shaman Guardians to rescue Singluen a while back. But… the 13 Shaman Guardians were driven away, while Singli was forced to take out the Dark God Thunder he illegally possessed as leverage to save his life. The opposite party was afraid of the Dark God Thunder, so they let him go. But Singli himself has committed a capital crime, so he didn’t come back with the 13 Shaman Guardians. He has escaped; we haven’t found any traces of him yet.”</p><p>The news was like a giant earthquake to the top-level clansmen, making them shocked to the core, unable to speak for a long time.</p><p>Singtuo then added, “Everyone, I’ll give you a few minutes to calm down before you prepare yourself to face the enemy with me! If Singluen really wants to carry out his misdeeds and threaten us by force with the help of foreign enemies, we are to kill him and those people! This is the tribulation for our Dark Shaman Clan. Whether we can get through this safely or not, it will rely on the unity of all of us to face our common enemy!”</p><p>Suddenly, a grayish-white haired old man who looked vigorous stood up from his chair. He raised the staff in his hand and shouted, “No foreign enemy is allowed to bully our clan! If Singluen really dares to collude with foreign enemies, then he has turned his back on us and has become our clan’s enemy. Death is the only proper treatment for our enemy. KILL THEM!”</p><p>“KILL!!!”</p><p>The rest followed suit and shouted.</p><p>At the gate of the Dark Shaman Clan’s land.</p><p>The convoy had just stopped. More than a dozen experts of the Dark Shaman Clan wore grim faces as they stared at Singluen, Tang Xiu, and the rest get off from the cars. Under the gate, the 13 Shaman Guardians were in battle-ready stances, eyes vigilantly observing Tang Xiu and Singluen’s people.</p><p>“HOLD UP!”</p><p>Singshou was a man with broad shoulders, a burly physique, and large eyes that depicted an ancient beast. He came forward with a machete in his hand and shouted loudly with aggressive killing aura.</p><p>Upon seeing Singshou, a look of dread filled Singluen’s eyes. There were the only two people he was afraid of in the entirety of the Dark Shaman Clan. One of whom was his father, Singtuo, while the other one was Singshou in front. He was regarded by all the clansmen as the top cultivation genius for the last century in their clan—the first person who could chade after the first expert of the clan, his father, Singtuo.</p><p>Furthermore, Singshou was a rough and brutal man with savagery etched in his bones. Fearless in nature, the man was never afraid of his father as the clan’s patriarch. Yet his loyalty to the clan was unquestionable and he was very respectful to Singtuo.</p><p>Singluen informed Tang Xiu about Singshou by whispering and finally concluded, “Mr. Tang, my five guardian elders’ cultivations have been progressing rapidly. But even if they reached a higher level, I’m afraid it’s still very difficult for the five of them to be a match for Singshou. Some clansmen have even rumored that his strength has overtaken my father’s.”</p><p>Tang Xiu himself was able to determine Singshou’s actual power from the aura emitted out by this man. This man’s cultivation was comparable to cultivators at the Golden Core Stage and should be an equal match to Tang Guang. However, Tang Guang was not the only one who came with him to the Dark Shaman Clan this time; there was still Tang An who was concealing herself, while he was also enough to kill him.</p><p>“Tell him to scram, or he’ll die!”</p><p>There was killing intent in Tang Xiu’s voice towards Singshou. This man should be ten years older than him, but he had already possessed such power at a young age. It was obvious that his talent in cultivation was remarkable. If he were to let this man go alive while Tang Xiu helped Singluen to be this clan’s patriarch, Singshou would become a strong pillar who would assist Singluen in the Dark Shaman Clan in the future.</p><p>And yet, the purpose as to why Tang Xiu helped Singluen was only to strike a trade deal. In the unlikely event that the Dark Shaman Clan was getting more and more formidable under Singluen’s control, it was very likely that Singluen wouldn’t be so respectful to him by then. The likelihood that he would harbor malice or disloyalty was high.</p><p>At the moment, Singluen, who thought that he was backed by formidable power from Tang Xiu and his men, immediately steeled himself as he paced a few steps forward. He directly stared at Singshou and shouted, “Singshou, why have you brought everyone here to drive me away? I’m also a member of the Dark Shaman Clan. I’m the Young Master of this clan, so don’t tell me that I need your permission to enter my own home?”</p><p>“Patriarch has commanded that non-members of the clan are not allowed to enter the clan’s land. Even clansmen must hand over their weapons before entering!” shouted Singshou. “Singluen, you’re the Second Young Master of the clan, and I’ll naturally won’t stop you here. But the rest are outsiders and must not enter the clan! You also must hand over your weapon. The Patriarch is waiting for you inside.”</p><p>Tang Xiu came to Singluen’s side and looked at Singshou who let out his boiling murderous aura. Then he said coldly, snorting, “Hmph, you’re very strong, but it’s not like you’re unkillable. I’m very clear of the power your Dark Shaman Clan possesses. It’s very easy for me to destroy all of you here. Stop blocking our way–don’t be a mantis that tries to stop a carriage. Otherwise, I don’t mind killing you first!”</p><p>“SHUT THE FUCK UP! You’re all foreign enemies of the clan. It’s you who must get the hell out of our place!” shouted Singshou.</p><p>“Heh, you refused a toast, but you’ll be forced to drink forfeit,” sneered Tang Xiu. “I hope you got what it takes to shout at me. Tang Guang, kill him.”</p><p>Tang Guang’s figure flickered and moved lightning-fast. He appeared in front Singshou in the blink of an eye and unleashed his immortal swords. Overlapping layers of sword images rolled forward as though torrential raging waves, storming over to devour the burly beast that was Singshou.</p><p>“Tenebrous Domain!”</p><p>Singshou stomped his foot as dark fog suddenly emerged around him. It quickly enveloped the area of nearly a hundred meters. He then raised the machete in his hand high and crazily fed it with his mana, creating a dozen meter machete image that slashed forward in an attempt to destroy all the sword images in front.</p><p>BOOM…</p><p>The collision between the immortal sword and the machete formed a huge fire. The smoldering shockwave forced most of the people around them to retreat staggeringly. It took them ten steps backward to stabilize their footing and figures.</p><p>Tang Guang and Singshou respectively stepped back ten steps, but everyone could sense that their killing aura kept soaring fast.</p><p>‘He’s a powerful enemy!’</p><p>The two men had a similar thought, yet it also aroused their fighting spirit. Even Tang Guang shouted at this moment, “I’ll deal with him alone. He’s my enemy and he must die under my sword!”</p><p>Tang Xiu, who stood nearby, surged out his Primal Chaos power to force back all the dark fog within a radius of over four meters around him. At this time, a concealed transmitted voice entered his ear:</p><p>“Would you like me to move and strike, Grand Master?”</p><p>Tang Xiu was silent for a moment and transmitted his reply, “Our purpose here is very simple–that is to kill him! If Tang Guang wants a match, I’ll arrange one for him later. But now is not the time.”</p><p>“I understand,” replied Tang An shortly. There was no other sound from her afterward.</p><p>The display of exquisite swordsmanship was now being showcased at the scene. The barrage of offensive magic spells emerged in an endless stream, combined with the power erupted from the mid-stage Golden Core Tang Guang, causing the Dark Shaman Clan’s gate to be destroyed by the aftermath. Singshou’s movements themselves were very simple, but each of his strikes accurately aimed at the critical points despite the wild and savage moves. In addition to that, the Tenebrous Domain he just cast proved to be an obstruction to a certain degree for Tang Guang, thus making them well-matched opponents.</p><p>“Heart Shredding Strike—KILL!”</p><p>Tang Guang’s figure rose from the ground. His immortal sword flickered and turned into unconstrained long sword lights that crushed down from the firmament. Sands and pebbles were blown away, while some soil and stones then formed a sword shape that shot forward to strike Singshou.</p><p>Singshou’s complexion was solemn to the extreme. He kept brandishing his machete, while the images of the blade erupted a much greater might. He had always been a man who held a firm belief that those who faced his enemy head-on were the brave ones. He was never afraid of death, and instead had always been expecting such a thrilling battle with his life on the stake to temper himself.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
