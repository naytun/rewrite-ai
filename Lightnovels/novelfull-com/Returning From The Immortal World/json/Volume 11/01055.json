Dao Master Ziyi, however, hesitated for a moment and only took it after the duo did.</p><p>Quickly, their injuries healed and their mental state became much stronger than before.</p><p>“What’s the situation with the beasts now?” asked Tang Xiu. “Do they pose a great threat to this blockade line?”</p><p>“I dunno the reason, but not all of the fierce beasts came out,” replied Miao Wentang, smiling bitterly. “Only a small group of beasts came out every time. But that makes me certain of one thing—if all the beasts are to come out at once, I’m afraid all of us here are not enough even if we are multiplied by ten.”</p><p>Tang Xiu took a deep breath while his urge to kill the Celestial Wizard Clan got more intense. If it wasn’t for the rumor spread out by them that caused all the cultivation forces around the world to flock to the Pacific Ocean, he wouldn’t have been this passive to take action. He would’ve been able to mobilize a large number of people from the Tang Sect and they could take this chance to train while protecting the people of China.</p><p>This clan must be removed in the future. Absolutely.</p><p>After vowing inwardly, Tang Xiu then spoke to Duanmu Lin, “Senior Duanmu, let’s set off now! I need to investigate and determine the weaknesses and strengths of these ominous beasts. I’m afraid that we can only resort to some special means if they are really powerful.”</p><p>“What special means?” asked Duanmu Lin hurriedly with a changed expression.</p><p>Tang Xiu glanced at him and shook his head wordlessly. He did have some deadly cards in hand, one of which was a mighty powerful card. But it had grave consequences once used.</p><p>Quickly after, everyone had appeared at the blockade line. Setting their eyes at the lush, snow-covered forested mountain at the opposite side, Tang Xiu instantly unleashed his perception and said in a deep voice, “All of you stay here. I’ll go inside to have a look alone.”</p><p>“You can’t act rashly, Tang Xiu,” said Duanmu Lin hastily. “I’ve sent some men to investigate before, but none returned. If my guess is correct, all of them have died in the hands of those beasts.”</p><p>“Just some fierce beasts are impossible to kill me.” Tang Xiu shook his head and said, “Senior Duanmu, this Tang Xiu has never done anything he’s unsure of. Rest your worry!”</p><p>His figure instantly flashed forward like an arrow toward the snow-capped mountain. After traversing for less than 10km, Tang Xiu firstly spotted a few rhino-like creatures crunching on two human bodies, leaving only the bloody flesh of their limbs.</p><p>ROAR…</p><p>One of the rhino-like creatures suddenly seemed to sense something and turned around to roar at Tang Xiu’s direction.</p><p>As Tang Xiu’s gaze was cast on those rhino-like creatures, his pupils suddenly shrunk and a look of disbelief was painted on his face. To his surprise, these rhino-like lifeforms were simply not fierce beasts but rather… demonic beasts!</p><p>“How is this possible?!</p><p>“Demonic beasts live in the Demon Realm, and unless there’s a very powerful one that can tear the space and come out of the Demon Realm, even if there’s any Demon Realm expert to bring them here, they will gradually turn weak and die. These demonic beasts are very weak, yet how can they arrive safely and survive on Earth?”</p><p>All he saw only made Tang Xiu deeply confused. More than that was the feeling of restlessness that grew more intense in his heart. One must know that fierce beasts were worlds apart from demonic beasts; three to five of the former wouldn’t necessarily able to face one of the latter.</p><p>The few rhino-like demonic beasts began stomping their hooves and charged towards Tang Xiu. Dark smoke vaguely lingered under their feet, while black rays faintly surged out from their horns.</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>Chilling light flitted across Tang Xiu’s eyes as he instantly unleashed his divine sword. The layer of sword images turned like flesh grinders and easily tore the outer scales of the demonic beasts’ bodies. The bloody wounds were then blasted, turning into pieces of flesh with their blood raining down all over the place.</p><p>“Each of these demonic beasts should be comparable to a Qi Refining Stage cultivator. This issue could be easily dealt with if all of them only had this strength. But it would be a problem if a large number of these demonic beasts are comparable to Foundation Establishment Stage or Golden Core Stage cultivators.”</p><p>Tang Xiu raised his left hand and contemplated it for a moment. He had several kinds of cards on his hand as final cards. Except for Gu Yan’er and Ji Chimei, he still had the Star Devourer Insect he brought out from the three-star vestige, though it had fallen into slumber ever since he took it out. He was sure that a big problem could arise if he were to awaken it. The reason being, it didn’t know how to avoid the Heavenly Dao laws of this plane. Once it used its power here, the Heavenly Dao laws would discover it and cause it great harm.</p><p>HOU! HOU!…</p><p>The howls of demonic beasts echoed from the depths of the mountain range. On the snow-capped mountain massif, a group of black shadows rushed over lightning fast. Dozens of long-winged bird species of demonic beasts directly flew over. Although they flew at a very low altitude, they were still much faster than the other running demonic beasts.</p><p>I gotta leave.</p><p>Tang Xiu put away the divine sword and retreated without hesitation. His speed was faster than those tens bird species demonic beasts. Shortly after he lost them, only then did he return to the blockade line.</p><p>“Tang Xiu!” Duanmu Lin and the rest strode to greet him, the worry on their faces gradually receding.</p><p>“It’s troublesome.” Tang Xiu forced a smile and said, “The creatures in that mountain range are not fierce beasts at all!”</p><p>“How can they have such strength and speed if they aren’t savage beasts?” Duanmu Lin’s complexion changed and hurriedly asked, “You have wide knowledge, Tang Xiu. What kind of beasts are they if they aren’t ominous beasts?”</p><p>“They are demonic beasts—lifeforms that should exist in another plane,” answered Tang Xiu. “I have no idea why they appeared on Earth.”</p><p>Duanmu Lin exchanged glances with the rest. After a while, he then asked with a worried face, “Are these demonic beasts very strong? Like, stronger than fierce beasts?”</p><p>“They are very strong.” Tang Xiu nodded and said, “I will need several fierce beasts of the same rank to face just one demonic beast. Also, I found that these demonic beasts have formidable power. I just killed some of them that are comparable to Qi Refining Stage cultivators, but their roars also attracted hundreds more from the depths. I’ve observed them and determined that there are at least some that should be on par with cultivators at the Foundation Establishment Stage.”</p><p>Hiss…</p><p>Miao Wentang, Shao Mingzhen, and Dao Master Ziyi trio gasped a cold breath, looking surprised and amazed, as well as feeling a chill down their spines.</p><p>It must be noted that Dao Master Ziyi’s strength was only at the mid-stage of Foundation Establishment after cultivating for many years, plus the fact that he had obtained a medicinal pill from Tang Xiu. Miao Wentang and Shao Mingzhen, on the other hand, had the strength at the late-stage of Foundation Establishment. However, even a tiger couldn’t fight a pack of wolves! If the number of demonic beasts was really in the hundreds, just a few of them wouldn’t be able to face them.</p><p>Furthermore, there were thousands of demonic beasts in this mountain range. Once they turned into a beast tide, the blockade line they just set up would definitely fall apart easily. By that time, they would flood into human society, and hell would break loose, turning the human world into purgatory.</p><p>Miao Wentang looked at Tang Xiu and asked with a slightly trembling voice, “Do you have any countermeasures, perchance? We’re all cultivators and the real powerhouses among humanity. But if we can’t stop those demonic beasts, it will be a calamity for ordinary people. Even… the disaster they bring will cause an unimaginable and horrifying situation.”</p><p>Tang Xiu suddenly turned to look at Duanmu Lin and said in a deep voice, “Senior Duanmu, I’ll need your help as well as aid from the country.”</p><p>“What kind of help do you need?” asked Duanmu Lin immediately. “As long as you can deal with those demonic beasts, I’ll communicate with the top leaders to try to fulfill it. No matter what you need.”</p><p>“My people are in the Pacific Ocean and we are currently in conflict with various cultivation forces all over the world,” said Tang Xiu. “The specific reason is due to a rumor deliberately spread by the Celestial Wizard Clan, saying that there are treasures useful to practitioners buried in the Pacific Ocean. The location is, in fact, the site of a sect there. So, I need the country’s cooperation in order to cover up this situation.”</p><p>“Elaborate it more specifically,” said Duanmu Lin.</p><p>“I need to mobilize all the cultivators under my sect and move them here to form a blockade line so as to prevent those demonic beasts from coming out as much as possible. Therefore, I need the country’s declaration that a certain island in the Pacific Ocean is a station of China’s Special Abilities Bureau. But due to the conflict with the Celestial Wizard Clan, this clan then deliberately spread the rumor and attempted to use other forces to destroy our branch there.”</p><p>Duanmu Lin nodded and said, “We’re in a time of danger, so I’ll agree to your request. I’ll immediately ask the superiors for instructions, but I believe they will agree to it.”</p><p>“One more thing. I need to go there at once to solve the troubles there as fast as possible. Further, I’ll also resort to a necessary action of purposely taking action to warn the others,” said Tang Xiu.</p><p>“What else do you need us to do in terms of military force?” asked Duanmu Lin in a deep voice.</p><p>“I hope some fighters can send me there.” Tang Xiu thought for a moment and said, “It’s a better way of announcing that the island is a Special Abilities Bureau’s secret branch. With the news already leaked, we need to withdraw our members there and abandon that branch.”</p><p>Duanmu Lin frowned and forced out a smile. “I’m afraid that would be a bit troublesome since I need to negotiate with the neighboring countries. However, I’ll promise you that too.”</p><p>Tang Xiu nodded in response. He gazed back at the depths of the Himalayas again. Then, he said in a deep voice, “I won’t be back for some time, so you’ll be in a very dangerous situation. I hope you can hold on for some time. Do contact me at once if a situation arises. I’ll need at most two days to come back with a large number of experts as reinforcement.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
