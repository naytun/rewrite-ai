All of them looked curious since the signature on the fighters indicated that they belonged to China.</p><p>However, this place was far away from China, yet their fighters flew to this place. Why didn’t the other countries stop these planes? For what reason did these aircraft fly here?</p><p>Tut, tut, tut…</p><p>Not long after, all the leaders of the practitioner forces of various countries received a message at nearly the same time: “The treasure that is said to be buried in the Pacific Ocean is just a sheer fabrication and the culprit for the rumor is the Celestial Wizard Clan, whose clansmen have been lost and subjected to grave injuries after a fight with China’s Special Abilities Bureau. Hence, they spread the rumor in an attempt to use major practitioner forces all over the world to attack the island, which is a branch of China’s Special Abilities Bureau.”</p><p>We’re all being used? Meaning that the news about the treasures is fake?</p><p>The Celestial Wizard Clan and China’s Special Abilities Bureau?</p><p>All the leaders of the various forces in the world turned furious and investigated the truth behind the declaration through various channels of intelligence. However, much to their surprise and disbelief, there was indeed bounty rewards for the Celestial Wizard Clan’s hunt as well as the news about the appearance of their clansmen in the Pacific Ocean, which made them believe this statement.</p><p>As for the treasure, if it was really here, then why would the Celestial Wizard Clan, who came to the Pacific Ocean earlier than them, act like a tortoise by calling all their clansmen back and none of them came out from their territory? It was impossible for them not to covet this treasure at all.</p><p>Another piece of news spread also spread out quickly after and was transmitted to the Heads of the various forces: “Chinese officials have also sought China cultivator forces to come forward to assist the evacuation of the secret branch of its Special Abilities Bureau.”</p><p>Cultivators, to all of them, were people whose existence was equal to great mountains—existences who brought heavy pressure to the forces’ leaders of various parties all over the world. Back when in the Crusades, some practitioner forces had once invaded China, and even a group of demons entered its territory… yet, after the numerous major events, they were eventually repelled by the oriental hermits, leaving dread in their hearts.</p><p>****</p><p>On the ninth empty island.</p><p>As Tang Xiu jumped from the fighter jet’s cabin, two luxurious liners on the nearby waters slowly sailed over. On the deck of one of the luxurious liners stood a middle-aged man who seemed to hold power in the Pyramid organization. He was sitting on a lounge chair and comfortably enjoying the massage of two beautiful blondes. In his hand was a glass of red wine, showing off his leisure and contented attitude.</p><p>“A new situation?”</p><p>He abruptly sat straight and hinted to the two pretty blondes to leave. His eyes then shifted to the three fighters in the sky. To his disbelief, he could see someone jumping down from nearly a kilometer high from the fighter’s cabin with his sharp, eagle-like eyes.</p><p>“Someone’s committing suicide?”</p><p>Next to the stalwart middle-aged man was a thin young man with a scar on his face. His pupils suddenly shrank and he said in a deep voice.</p><p>The middle-aged man didn’t speak. After he stood up from the lounge chair, he just crossed his hands and looked up at the figure in the sky while harboring the same thoughts as those around him, thinking that person was going to commit suicide. After all, jumping straight from the air nearly a kilometer high would make one meet their tragic death even if he fell into the seawater below.</p><p>“Impossible!”</p><p>The middle-aged man’s face suddenly shifted with a look of disbelief in his eyes. He could clearly see that the figure jumped from one kilometer high initially, but then he lunged down with his head then floated midair 200-plus meters above the sea with his feet down and just stood still midair there.</p><p>The thin young man suddenly exclaimed, “God! How did he do it? How powerful is he to achieve such a feat?”</p><p>At this moment, the stalwart middle-aged man could see Tang Xiu’s face. After being silent for a moment, his gaze suddenly shifted to the looming island not far away. Then, he ordered in a deep voice, “Change the course and sail towards that island!”</p><p>Tang Xiu, who was flying high up in the air, originally intended to enter the ninth empty island. However, he changed his intention after seeing the emergence of the two liners that unexpectedly sailed quickly in the same direction. A chilling light flashed on his face upon seeing them.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>Shadows moved lightning-fast from the ninth empty island. It was Mo Awu with five experts of the Tang Sect who easily walked on the sea surface. The six of them had also spotted Tang Xiu.</p><p>“Hold on!”</p><p>As Tang Xiu floated down to the sea surface, he blocked the path of the two luxury liners, whereas Mo Awu’s group of six who had arrived, respectfully stood behind him.</p><p>On the liner, the executive of the Pyramid, Movinyl, stood on the bow deck and signaled the liners to stop. He stared at Tang Xiu and asked, “Are you from China?”</p><p>“We are,” replied Tang Xiu indifferently. “Who are you and why did you come here?”</p><p>“I’m Movinyl of the Pyramid. Why can’t we come here? This place is international waters,” answered Movinyl. “But I feel very strange, though. Just when did China have such an ability, that your country’s fighters can fly over the Pacific Ocean and come here.”</p><p>“That’s not your business to manage. But I can tell you that the island in front is the secret branch of China’s Special Abilities Bureau,” said Tang Xiu in a deep voice. “We’re preparing to evacuate it after the enmity with the Celestial Wizard Clan, so if you have no other business, please leave. Otherwise…”</p><p>“Otherwise what? Are you planning to fight us too?” Movinyl lightly asked with squinted eyes.</p><p>“Heh, just you alone? You’re not even worthy.” Tang Xiu sneered and said, “But if you really want to try to come to our Special Abilities Bureau, then don’t blame us for being merciless.”</p><p>“That’s some balls you got. Daring to pick my Pyramid organization as an enemy,” replied Movinyl coldly.</p><p>“The Pyramid is indeed very strong. I admit that you’re regarded as the world’s largest organization. But I have to tell you that no matter how powerful your organization is, it’s not like you can contend with China’s entire forces. Further, I’m also a cultivator assigned to aid the Special Abilities Bureaus’ people here. If your Pyramid wants to take over the Celestial Wizard Clan’s spot, you can do it now.”</p><p>“Do you really have a conflict with the Celestial Wizard Clan?” asked Movinyl curiously.</p><p>“It’s not just a simple conflict,” said Tang Xiu. “Those Celestial Wizard Clansmen are damned! They tried to steal our core materials, killing many of our people in the process. After we slaughtered most of their troops sent here, they also deliberately spread rumors that there are some treasures or something in the Pacific Ocean in the hope to lure all the world’s major practitioner forces to find our Special Abilities Bureau’s branch. You can say that they’ve achieved their goal, but they have made our agency their arch enemy.”</p><p>Movinyl fell into silence for a moment, and then asked again, “If so, was it you who put up such a sky-high bounty for them?”</p><p>“We’re cultivators. Money doesn’t mean much to us.” Tang Xiu sneered. “China as a country might be reluctant to kill these enemies, but cultivators like us will never allow ourselves to be killed and remain indifferent. Hence, the Celestial Wizard Clan can expect to meet their demise, for I will completely destroy this clan in the future. They will pay the most painful price for this transgression.”</p><p>“You have such a strong tone and unusual powers as well, Sir.” Movinyl gave a thumbs up and praised. “The Pyramid doesn’t want to be an enemy of your country’s Special Abilities Bureau and cultivators. On the contrary, the Celestial Wizard Clan is a vassal of the Stygian Club, who we have deep enmity with. The adage of your country says that the enemy of my enemy is my friend. Further, we’re not enemies but have common enemies. So, I hope that you can truly destroy the Celestial Wizard Clan completely.”</p><p>Tang Xiu’s brows picked up and he cupped his fists in response. “Since your distinguished self doesn’t want to be enemies with us, Chinese cultivators, then I have to ask you to leave. We’ll make the Celestial Wizard Clan pay their due debt sooner or later. I don’t mind contacting you to let you watch the show when the time comes. But of course, it would also be better for us if you’re willing to join us in that effort.”</p><p>Movinyl shot a deep look at Tang Xiu as well as Mo Awu’s group of six behind him. Then, he turned to speak to the thin youth and ordered, “Turn around and change direction. We’re leaving.”</p><p>“Understood!” replied the thin youth and immediately passed his order.</p><p>Calmly watching as the two liners disappeared from his sight, Tang Xiu then turned to look at Mo Awu and said in a deep voice, “Notify all the experts at the Foundation Establishment Stage and above on the ninth empty island to return to Nine Dragons Island immediately. Do remember to pay attention to erase their trails. If any of you encounter anyone on your way back, kill them without mercy regardless of who they are!”</p><p>“Acknowledged!”</p><p>Mo Awu didn’t know what had happened, but he still respectfully complied.</p><p>Quickly after, all the cultivators at the Foundation Establishment Stage and above secretly returned to Nine Dragons Island, directly deserting the ninth island that was originally planned as a place for the camouflage. However, there were still numerous islands in the surrounding waters, so he kept the surveillance active to spot any approaching people or ship in advance.</p><p>At the square of the palace.</p><p>With hands behind his back, Tang Xiu looked at the nearly 200 Foundation Establishment Stage and above experts before him and began speaking, “Everyone, China is now facing a huge crisis posed by a massive number of demonic beasts from the depths of Himalaya. A demonic beast is a creature much more fearsome than any species of fierce beasts since one of these beasts is able to fight against several fierce beasts of the same level. Therefore, you’re to return to China with me in order to protect ordinary citizens. But you can expect that you’ll walk on the thread of life and death since you must kill as many demonic beasts as possible.”</p><p>Gu Xiaoxue paced two steps forward and saluted before asking, “Then, what about this place, Grand Master?”</p><p>“I can feel relieved since Yan’er is guarding the fort here,” replied Tang Xiu with a deep voice. “Also, Xiaoxue and Tang An, you both will stay here. Do everything in your power to kill anyone who finds Nine Dragons Island. Certainly, don’t give them any chance to leak the existence of this island!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
