But the place was now filled with the sounds of gunfire as well as the smell of blood wafting in the air.</p><p>The nearer Tang Xiu approached this block along with Tang 28’s group of five, the clearer the gunshots sounded. As they eventually appeared at the crossroads, a tragic scene greeted them with dozens of cars in a series of crashes and a lot of victims everywhere.</p><p>“What a mess.”</p><p>He saw more than a dozen police cars blocking the streets in the surroundings, while tens of armed policemen were engaged in an intense gunfight with a dozen bad guys. A look of helplessness appeared on his handsome face and he could sense cadaveric energy again from those dozen men.</p><p>“You guys deal with those people,” said Tang Xiu calmly.</p><p>Tang 28 nodded. Just as he walked a few steps forward, he suddenly stopped as he saw his companions standing still. He immediately looked at Tang Xiu and shifted again to the four children, stating. “I picked you guys before, so if you want to follow Sect Master, then you’re to obey his command.”</p><p>“But we haven’t killed people before,” one of the boys hesitantly replied.</p><p>Tang 28 looked at Tang Xiu again with hesitation on his face since he never killed anyone either. And, though he used to have a bitter and rough life, was homeless and had no one to depend on, and fighting with other children and getting bullied by people was a common thing, yet he still had inexplicable fear when it came to killing.</p><p>While looking at the five children, Tang Xiu sneered. “I told you to deal with them, but I didn’t say that you must kill them, did I? This situation is not suitable for killing, so you just need to discard their ability and stun them. But I just found quite a serious issue today, really. Your hands have yet to be stained by blood and you’ve never killed the enemy until now. It seems that you still have things to work with, given your ability to put the experience and the mental state you’ve transformed in that illusion into practice.”</p><p>Tang 28 was shaken and quickly said, “We’ll leave immediately, Sect Master!”</p><p>As his voice faded away, he and his four companions ran into the distance. At their speed, even those who had their eyes trained on them would only see their afterimages, while those who didn’t pay attention wouldn’t even notice them brushing past.</p><p>Tang Xiu then glanced around to the dead bodies at the crossroads before his sight eventually fell to a wounded man curled up on the ground whining in pain.</p><p>‘It’s time to save people!’</p><p>He no longer hesitated and ran to the crossroad even though he had to brave the hail of bullets. He used the colliding cars as shields to avoid the bullets and successfully came to a nearly crushed car.</p><p>“Help me! My legs are stuck.”</p><p>A Buick sedan’s driver door was opened and a fat middle-aged man whose face full of blood and looked in pain pleaded to Tang Xiu when he squatted outside his car’s door.</p><p>Tang Xiu spread out his perception to cover hundreds of meters in a circle. He could even capture the trajectories of the bullets flying around in the covered area. He then looked at the pained middle-aged man before him, quickly stood up and entered the car. Exerting his strength, he easily pushed away from the object that made the fat man’s leg stuck.</p><p>Puff, puff…</p><p>He quickly took out the silver needles and pierced the acupoints around the two serious wounds on the fat middle-aged man’s body before carefully pulling him out of the car. He then spoke to him in a low voice, “Don’t worry. I’m a Chinese medicine doctor. You have serious injuries and your legs are broken. I’ve already sealed up your wounds, so you won’t lose too much blood and it won’t endanger your life. Just sit still here and don’t move. Wait for the bad guys to be subdued by the cops and the medics will come here to treat you.”</p><p>The fat middle-aged man grabbed Tang Xiu’s hand and hurried asked, “Can my legs be cured later, Doc? I…”</p><p>Patting his shoulder, Tang Xiu nodded and said, “No worries! I’ll go to the hospital to find you myself once all this is over. You can be sure that I can cure your legs then. I still need to find and treat the others, so pay attention to your own safety now.”</p><p>“You’re going to save more people, Doc? God! Are you crazy? Those villains are trading bullets with the cops. If you walk around now… bullets have no eyes, Doc! W-what if you get shot?”</p><p>“Don’t worry!” Tang Xiu gave him a calm smile and said, “I can snatch people’s life from the King of Hell, so I have my ways to protect my own life.”</p><p>Seeing that Tang Xiu had made up his mind and seemed about to move, the fat middle-aged man immediately asked, “What’s your name, Doc? You saved me, so please gimme your name.”</p><p>“My name’s Tang Xiu.”</p><p>Tang Xiu replied without turning back. He then used another car as cover and ran towards the wounded who fell to the ground seven-plus meters away. Bullets flew around him and the police nearby shouted at him, though he ignored everything. Several times the bullets came his way, but he avoided them all without anyone noticing.</p><p>After a short while, Tang Xiu was holding a severely wounded person. After picking him up, he rushed towards a crashed SUV a few meters away. Yet, those few seconds still made the dozens of policemen full of cold sweat in worry and some people hiding in some hidden spots felt their hearts tighten.</p><p>At the northeast corner from the crossroads.</p><p>A building with 30 floors, the Big Golden Eagle Store, had its first to twelfth floors full of a variety of expensive goods for sale. The sixth floor was a clothing area, full of all kinds of famous women’s foreign clothing brands. Yet, by a certain window, Tian Xiaomeng was sweating profusely while nervously holding the display case and pointing the camera at the fierce gun battle below.</p><p>“Guys, I’m very vexed, sad, and angry. My grieving is for those innocents who have fallen in their own pool of blood. Yet, I feel so angry… so damn angry at myself that I can’t do anything at all and just watch them lose their lives. Those fucking damn villains are truly so heartless and cruel. They dare to kill people in this bustling block full of people in Beijing!</p><p>“All dear fans, Little Meng really didn’t expect to encounter this horrible incident! I was just going to Beijing to attend an entertainment program, yet I must see such a hell loose on earth now. Dear fans and all the friends who are now watching this live broadcast platform and seeing all those innocent victims below, please join me and pray for their survival…”</p><p>At this moment, the number of people across the country watching Tian Xiaomen’s live channel had reached over a hundred thousand. As time passed by, the number of viewers flocking in and the number of subscribers also increased at an incredibly fast rate. In just five-odd minutes, the number of subscribers watching the live channel had exceeded 300,000.</p><p>And yet, none of them talked nor sent gifts!</p><p>Each pair of shocked and sympathetic viewer eyes only stared at the tragic scene playing on the screen. Many timid girls and kind boys even covered their mouths and burst into tears.</p><p>Suddenly, Tian Xiaomeng slightly shivered and disbelief appeared in her bright, big eyes. Although the hands that held the camera were shaking, she still exclaimed in alarm, “Who is he? It’s very dangerous over there, yet… w-why did he rush over there?”</p><p>“Who?”</p><p>Her voice that was now heard by hundreds of thousands of people led to an intense curiosity. At this moment, some people among the hundreds of thousands had identified the figure in the footage. The footage itself was bit blurred, but some were still able to recognize that person’s face.</p><p>“Tang Xiu.”</p><p>It was unknown who the person that typed the two words in the comment section was.</p><p>Suddenly, the hundreds of thousands of viewers were pulled by the scene where a figure ran to a smashed SUV and quickly recognized him as Tang Xiu, a well-known small business owner and a kind, good doctor with a golden heart.</p><p>“That’s Tang Xiu!”</p><p>“Tang Xiu!”</p><p>“Tang Xiu!”</p><p>“…”</p><p>Numerous viewers began typing these two words in the commentary box and the name made the commentary box crazily scroll downward.</p><p>Eyes fixedly staring at Tang Xiu’s figure, Tian Xiaomeng’s breathing turned faster while worry and restlessness filled her eyes. Tears even burst out from her eye sockets as they quickly slipped down a delicate and lovely face.</p><p>“He… he’s saving them!”</p><p>Muttering in a sob and mixed emotions filling her heart, Tian Xiaomeng watched as Tang Xiu rescued the pained and whining injured man curled up on the ground. He picked him up and sprinted to the side of the SUV to avoid the bullets flying around him.</p><p>Suddenly, she seemed to recall something. Even though her face didn’t appear in the footage, her voice was spread to the hundreds of thousands of viewers:</p><p>“Dear friends, you are all not mistaken! He’s indeed Tang Xiu. The brother I respect the most and the most famous Young Divine Doctor in our country! It’s really him who is now rushing out into the rain of bullets to save the lives of the injured. I’m pleading to Heaven and to the Gods… please bless him. Please let him be safe and bless him in his endeavor to save that injured man…”</p><p>“Bless him.”</p><p>“Bless and protect him.”</p><p>“…”</p><p>The “Bless and protect” words replaced Tang Xiu’s name in the commentary box. The deep worry and concern they had for Tang Xiu and their blessing and prayers for him filled the commentary box. Tang Xiu’s name had been etched deep inside their hearts and they remembered his face all along deeply.</p><p>What was bravery? What was a hero?</p><p>Prior to this, they knew that the existence of a hero was very difficult to find nowadays. But now they just saw what a hero was. They watched as someone ignored his own safety and braved the dangers under the hail of bullets where he could possibly be shot and die at any time, yet still rushed forward to save people.</p><p>Time fleeted by and the number of viewers watching Tian Xiaomeng’s live channel had increased more and more and exceeded 1.5 million in just ten minutes. However, everyone who got shocked by the footage had now sobered up and could see clearly the figure that kept running to save the victims under the rain of bullets.</p><p>“The eighth one! He has treated eight injured victims and also brought them to a temporary safe place. This man is my idol. A man I deeply respect. Please be safe.” With tears on her face, Tian Xiaomeng’s voice passed into the ears of more than 1.5 million people.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
