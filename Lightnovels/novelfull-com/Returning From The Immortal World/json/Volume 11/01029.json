Aside from letting out a forced smile, he had no idea what kind of emotion he should use to voice his feelings.</p><p>Men were bound by their desires for food and sex.</p><p>The words of the ancient truly had its own truth. Men in heat couldn’t control their male hormones regardless of everything. Speaking about it, finding a girlfriend was indeed a good and reasonable choice. At least they wouldn’t have to bother five girls more, but they could harmonize the Yin-Yang elements inside them, which were conducive to their physical and mental health.</p><p>“Anyway, I need to deal with something first, Zhao Liang. I’ll head straight to the classroom in the afternoon later.” Tang Xiu unplugged the cell phone charger and went out even though his cell phone’s battery was less than 10% charged.</p><p>“Where’re you going to, Big Bro Tang?” called out Zhao Liang.</p><p>“I’m gonna go find Teacher Han!” answered Tang Xiu.</p><p>Zhao Liang left his dorm, leaned against the door and grinningly said, “Well, you’re asking for luck, you know. Teacher Han returned to the campus a few days ago, but it’s obvious that she’s kinda in a foul mood. Be careful not to annoy her, lest she packs you up, got it?”</p><p>Staring blankly for a moment, Tang Xiu furrowed his brows and asked, “You said that Teacher Han just returned to campus a few days ago? So to say, she wasn’t here before school started?”</p><p>“Yup!” Zhao Liang nodded. “I heard she took sick leave or something. But she looked awful when she came back a couple of days ago. I heard that the Director himself advised her to rest for a few more days, though she refused to do so.”</p><p>A pensive look flashed across Tang Xiu’s eyes. Falling ill for Han Qingwu was nearly impossible given her physical condition. After all, she had become a cultivator and her power was by no means weak. Such a bad complexion meant only one thing: she had been injured.</p><p>Who could have injured her?</p><p>With various thoughts swirling in his mind, Tang Xiu bade farewell to Zhao Liang and left the dormitory building. As he strolled through the forest path on the campus, Tang Xiu then called Han Qingwu’s cell number.</p><p>“Where are you?”</p><p>“You’re back?”</p><p>“Where are you now?”</p><p>“….”</p><p>Han Qingwu was silent for a while before slowly replying, “At the canteen.”</p><p>“I’ll be waiting for you at the campus gate,” said Tang Xiu.</p><p>He hung up and walked straight outside the campus. He had two main purposes before coming to Shanghai, one of which was to report back to the campus and the other was to probe and confront Han Qingwu. He had now determined that Han Qingwu was Xue Qingcheng’s reincarnation, yet he still needed to figure out whether she had completely restored her memory. He couldn’t determine it before obtaining the Violet Fairy. But now was a different story since the appearance of the Violet Fairy gave him a way out to do so.</p><p>Ring, ring, ring…</p><p>His cell phone’s ringtone sounded, and Tang Xiu looked at the caller’s name on the screen. It was unexpectedly Chen Zhizhong.</p><p>“Is there something up, Zhizhong?”</p><p>“I’m now at the entrance of Shanghai University, Master,” said Chen Zhizhong with a respectful voice. “I stopped by at the Bluestar Villa Complex to find you, but I heard you went to campus, so here I came. Is it convenient for you to meet me now?”</p><p>“What are you in Shanghai for, though?” asked Tang Xiu.</p><p>“There’s something very important I need to report to you, Master,” answered Chen Zhizhong. “I also want to consult some cultivation aspects with you.”</p><p>“Alright. Wait at the campus gate, I’ll catch up with you soon,” said Tang Xiu.</p><p>After hanging up, he then continued heading toward the campus gate. He knew that Chen Zhizhong would never come to Shanghai should he have no important things to consult with him. Chen Zhizhong was his disciple—though he was just an in-name disciple—he still needed to guide him in his cultivation path.</p><p>When Tang Xiu walked out of the campus gate, the previous few luxurious supercars that were parked outside the gate had disappeared along with those silk pants young masters. There were a black Mercedes Bens parked there now, and Chen Zhizhong was standing in front of that car, waiting for him.</p><p>“Zhizhong.” Tang Xiu called as he came over. He found that Chen Zhizhong’s cultivation had advanced to the Foundation Establishment Stage, more so that he had reached the late-stage and was only a step away from reaching the Golden Core Stage.</p><p>“Did I disturb you, Master?” asked Chen Zhizhong after respectfully bowed.</p><p>“It’s all right. I was just coming out when you called me. Tell me, what important things you want to tell me?” asked Tang Xiu.</p><p>Chen Zhizhong looked around. After seeing that no one around paying attention to them, he whispered, “A senior executive in my company recently heard that some herbs with psychic property were found in the depths of Cangbai Mountain, so I took someone and secretly went there. We eventually found nothing there. There was no Soulpsyche Herb, but a mysterious cave instead.”</p><p>“What did you find in that cave?” asked Tang Xiu.</p><p>“We did everything we could to open the portal of that cave, but it didn’t budge at all,” answered Chen Zhizhong with a bitter smile. “But we found a few precious ores at the entrance instead.”</p><p>Having said that, he immediately opened the Mercedes Benz’s trunk, pulling out a lock-combination silver suitcase from the inside and returned back to Tang Xiu. He then put the silver suitcase on the car’s hood, entering some numbers and opened it as he spoke to Tang Xiu, “These are the ores I told you about, Master. I’ve browsed through a lot of records and finally figured out that these ores are called Bloodsoul Stones. As recorded, this Bloodsoul Stone was put into the dissected body of a living person. If that person didn’t die and the stone has been stored in that person’s body for at least 10 years, it will solidify. After hundreds or thousands of years, it ultimately turned into a Bloodsoul Stone. As recorded in the ancient records, this Bloodsoul Stone has a function to calm or suppress souls.”</p><p>Tang Xiu calmly grabbed a piece and carefully observed it. After some careful observation, he sighed. “This is indeed a Bloodsoul Stone, though I never expected for this object to also exist on Earth. You’re right. Bloodsoul Stone is a very precious ore, and it’s also very rare—an extremely precious gem for cultivators.”</p><p>“You know how to use it, Master?” asked Chen Zhizhong.</p><p>“I do.” Tang Xiu nodded.</p><p>A pleasantly surprised look appeared on his face, then Chen Zhizhong said again, “Since you said that it’s an extremely precious gem, it means that there are definitely some things better in that cave, Master. This is also the reason why I came here to report it to you.”</p><p>Light flashed across Tang Xiu’s eyes. He was well aware of Chen Zhizhong’s meaning. For an excellent object such as Bloodsoul Stone to be found outside that cave, it was very likely that there were more good findings to be expected inside it. If they could find more good things for cultivators there, then he had made a great contribution.</p><p>“Stay in Shanghai for some time first, Zhizhong. I still have some things to do here, then I’ll immediately contact you after I’m done and we’ll set off to Changbai Mountain together,” said Tang Xiu.</p><p>“I already planned to stay here for a while. I’m staying in the Hilton Hotel now,” replied Chen Zhizhong respectfully. “I’ll text you my room number later then.”</p><p>Tang Xiu nodded in response. His eyes then saw Han Qingwu walking out from the campus gate and he spoke, “Alright, you should go back first. I’ll find you after I’m done with my things.”</p><p>“As you will it, Master,” replied Chen Zhizhong as he boarded the car and quickly left.</p><p>Tang Xiu then turned around and walked towards Han Qingwu. He looked at her in silence for a while before speaking, “There’s a skating rink nearby. Let’s have a chat there.”</p><p>An ice-skating rink?</p><p>For a while, Han Qingwu fell into silence. But she found Tang Xiu had turned around and led the way first. Despite hesitating, she followed him. She had no idea why Tang Xiu wanted her to go with him. But she had been preparing herself for more than a year, yet the days went by with a prayer that such a day would come later on.</p><p>Shanghai was still burning hot even though it was already September. Noon was even the hottest time of the day lately. The ice-skating rink was empty and there were only two employees with no guests. They looked bored and engaged in small talk while crunching melon seeds.</p><p>“How much does it cost to rent the whole venue?” asked Tang Xiu directly after he came in front of the two employees.</p><p>Upon hearing this, the two employees suddenly jolted. They looked at Tang Xiu and Han Qingwu, thinking that it was natural for some rich scion of a wealthy family to bring a belle over. One of them then immediately replied, “It’s 3,000 yuan per hour. How long will you reserve the whole venue, though?”</p><p>Tang Xiu took out his wallet and took out a stack of hundred-yuan bills from inside. Then, he handed it over to the man and said, “Here are five grand for an hour. But I have one request. You can’t stay here. We don’t want to be disturbed.”</p><p>“No problem.” The staff member took over the bills in surprise and happily pulled his colleague to leave quickly.</p><p>Han Qingwu just watched Tang Xiu calmly and wordlessly. She knew that Tang Xiu was not the kind to waste money on a whim, even if he was so rich now. He must have his intentions to bring her here and fork out so much money. Yet, she could tell that his intention was very likely aimed at herself.</p><p>Peng! Peng! Peng!</p><p>Tang Xiu’s wrist moved and three silver needles were instantly shot at the same time, accurately hitting the CCTV cameras in three directions. Then, he turned to look at Han Qingwu and apathetically said, “Have you remembered everything now?”</p><p>The question made Han Qingwu’s heart tremble. However, she still put on a confused look on the outside and asked, “Pardon?”</p><p>Tang Xiu let out a sneer and walked to the center of the ice rink. Then, his pace came to a halt and he said in a heavy voice, “You can hide it for a while but not for a lifetime. If my guess is correct, it was you who helped me in Bangkok. And it was also you the woman who appeared in the Pacific Ocean, wasn’t it?”</p><p>“I don’t get what you mean.” Han Qingwu shook her head.</p><p>“So, are you now playing dumb?” Tang Xiu sneered.</p><p>“Don’t beat around the bush and speak straight if you got anything to say, Tang Xiu,” said Han Qingwu. “I really have no idea why you have so much animosity towards me. Just tell me, what did I do to wrong you? I believe we can make it clear if it’s a misunderstanding.”</p><p>Speaking out everything? Clearly?</p><p>A faint pain panged deep inside Tang Xiu’s heart. It wasn’t like he didn’t want to make everything clear with Han Qingwu, but it was because he couldn’t figure out whether she had restored all the memories of her previous life.</p><p>Buzz…</p><p>An oval container appeared in Tang Xiu’s palm out of the blue as he shot a straight gaze at Han Qingwu’s face. With an indifferent and apathetic face, he said, “I refined this thing myself in the past—the one thing I gave to someone who once had been my true love… You… you should’ve seen this before, shouldn’t you?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
