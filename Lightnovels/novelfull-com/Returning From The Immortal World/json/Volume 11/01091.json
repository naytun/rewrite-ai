It must be noted that each Hectometer Aeroglider unit was priced at two million yuan, so 10,000 units would 20 billion yuan; whereas the energy battery was 200 yuan each, which meant they would get 200 million yuan from selling one million units.</p><p>How much did they invest previously to develop this Hectometer Aeroglider, you ask?</p><p>Tang Xiu inwardly laughed. The total investment he gave to Mo Yi’s tech team for the development funds was 200 million yuan. And Kang Xia had reported to him that only half of it was used.</p><p>Furthermore, this was just the beginning!</p><p>The moment that money came rolling in would be when the Hectometer Aeroglider began to enter the market and sold to the public. There would be countless people, various countries, and numerous forces competing to buy it. At that time, the fortune they would obtain would simply be too many to count.</p><p>As Tang Xiu thought up to this point, he looked at Duanmu Lin and said, “Senior Duanmu, after our Magnificent Tang Corporation finishes developing the upgraded version of the Hectometer Aeroglider, we won’t only give the state 50% discount, but I’m also willing to share 20% of the global profit sales as donation.”</p><p>In response, Duanmu Lin shot a deep gaze to Tang Xiu. After a long time, he gave a thumbs up and praised. “I won’t say thanks, but you can expect the support from the state when the Hectometer Aeroglider is sold globally in the future.”</p><p>“Alrighty!” Tang Xiu firmly nodded.</p><p>In fact, he knew perfectly well that if ordinary people, or if some super-rich tycoon owned this kind of heaven-defying and a state-of-the-art product, the state would, in all likelihood, go so far so as to control them, and even confiscate it. After all, the profits would be beyond just being lucrative; even the state wouldn’t be able to ignore it.</p><p>However, he was not any Tom, Harry, or Jerry. The state wouldn’t dare to strongarm him. No matter what era, the world was still run based on the hard truth where “might makes right”.</p><p>Tang Xiu looked at Kang Xia and said in a deep voice, “Allocate 10% of the profits for charity when the Hectometer Aeroglider is sold globally. Establish schools and hospitals to help all those in need in China. This 10% allocation must never be disturbed no matter how much we earn.”</p><p>Kang Xia looked back at Tang Xiu with admiration and love. She knew his heart. He always treated his enemies ruthlessly, but the deepest recess of his heart was full of kindness. She could even imagine that 10% of the profits earned from selling the Hectometer Aeroglider would be a huge figure, and yet he still decided as such. She could imagine how many people would benefit from it in the future.</p><p>The figure would absolutely be sky-high!</p><p>Duanmu Lin looked at Tang Xiu with a slightly different expression. The previous Tang Xiu had medical ethics and did some good deeds out of kindness. But his decision now would change the fate of countless poor people! This was… virtuousness out of a righteous principle.</p><p>After signing the contract, Duanmu Lin and the Special Abilities Bureau’s top executives no longer stayed. They didn’t even have dinner as they hurriedly left Jingmen Island.</p><p>At dinner, Tang Xiu took Kang Xia and Yuan Chuling’s group of four to have a meal in the hall. After satiating their hunger and thirst, the shock that shrouded Yuan Chuling’s group had completely disappeared. Tang Xiu asked the waiter to remove the leftovers and changed the servings into tea. Then, he took out a cigarette and lit it up.</p><p>“Yuan Chuling, Yue Kai, and you, Hu Qingsong. You three should understand now what big business is, right?” asked Tang Xiu with a smile.</p><p>“Yeah, I just witnessed it. I admit.” Yuan Chuling forced a wry smile with twitching lips.</p><p>“In actuality, today’s business deal is only one of the deals carried out by my Magnificent Tang Corporation. It wasn’t that big of a deal at all,” Tang Xiu continued with a smile. “If anything, I’ve been thinking about you guys. The fortune earned by my company is hard to imagine for you as the capital from the deals between me and the country, or with other prominent business owners, is sometimes bigger than the deal you just witnessed. The three of you are my classmates and also my brothers, yet you just ran to Jingmen Island for a dog fight for some trivial pocket money. How do you feel about that?”</p><p>Yuan Chuling let out a dry smile and said, “Big Bro Tang, if I were to say that I feel confident and good about myself, you’d definitely slap me and pull my ears. Frankly, my old man is the person I’ve been admiring the most since he’s a self-made man who fights against the world with barely anything, yet he earns so much money and now becomes a powerful man. But you’re my biggest idol now. I give you my word that I’ll definitely look up to you in the future. I’ll strive hard and manage my business well so I can make a fortune myself.”</p><p>“What Old Yuan said are my thoughts exactly, Big Bro Tang,” echoed Yue Kai. “I won’t be careless and neglect my responsibility by fooling around again later, and I’ll seriously consider my future path. Also, even though I’ve told you many times that I’m thankful to you, I won’t say it this time and put it in my heart.”</p><p>Hu Qingsong scratched the back of his head and dryly smiled. “Uh, well, Big Bro Tang. You know I don’t have such great abilities, nor do I have big ambitions. But today, you really gave me too much stimulation, you know. Well, I just meekly ask you whether you have a younger brother to serve you tea and the likes, though. I’ll do everything you tell me even if it is to sleep!”</p><p>“Bah, get lost!” Tang Xiu snappily cursed and was at a loss whether he had to cry or laugh upon hearing his words. Then, he spoke again, “Anyhow, you got your old man’s enterprise, Old Yuan. You’ll take it over in the future, so it’s your call to choose your own path. Yue Kai, your family is also doing business, so I won’t say much. But when you take over your father’s business in the future, my company can cooperate with your family in many aspects, so we can earn a fortune together.”</p><p>“Got it!”</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Yuan Chuling and Yue Kai nodded quietly in answer.</p><p>Hu Qingsong, on the other hand, rolled his eyes and unhappily said, “What about me, Big Bro?”</p><p>“Haha…” Tang Xiu chuckled and said, “Well, you can work for me later just like Xue Chao! Relax, though. I’m sure those who work for me can also become billionaires.”</p><p>Hu Qingsong’s eyes lit up and he excitedly rubbed his hands.</p><p>“Hold up. Don’t feel that happy first, will you?” Tang Xiu smilingly said, “I have my own rules for employing people, at least you gotta have the ability to deserve it. If anything, since you don’t wanna stay at Shanghai University for a long time, then you should study while working part-time. Kang Xia, take care of this boy and arrange for him an internship in the company branch in Shanghai. Make him start from the bottom and give him all the hard work. You gotta squeeze him to make out an excellent leader out of this guy before he graduates from college.”</p><p>“No problem.” Kang Xia smilingly nodded. She was sincerely happy upon seeing Tang Xiu arrange these students in this way. It showed that he didn’t look down on Yuan Chuling and the rest because of their ability and current status, while at the same time proving himself as a real man with an empathetic heart.</p><p>Hu Qingsong didn’t say anything more but feel so moved. He had been in the dark and confused about the path ahead. Even if he was greatly stimulated today, it was never easy to create any great cause for accomplishments. At the very least, he didn’t have much capital to support himself.</p><p>He could feel Tang Xiu’s sincerity and also understood him as an affectionate and empathetic brother. He wasn’t the only one Tang Xiu treated like this since he witnessed him help Xue Chao many times.</p><p>Late at night, Tang Xiu stood quietly by the window while hugging Kang Xia’s slender waist, looking at the dim streetlights outside and the dancing shadows of the trees. At this time, he felt very tranquil inside.</p><p>“Are you going back to Shanghai, or return to Star City?” asked Tang Xiu gently to Kang Xia’s ear.</p><p>“What I want the most is to leave for Nine Dragons Island with you,” replied Kang Xia softly.</p><p>“Alright, let’s go together since you wish it so!” Tang Xiu smiled and said, “Arrange and delegate your work first and then give yourself a vacation.”</p><p>“Having your words is already enough, though.” Kang Xia smiled and said, “Anyways, the Magnificent Tang Corporation is literally having a harvest season, so I need to stay in Star City to supervise it, while there are also some issues in Shanghai. The progress of the project there is very fast after we invested more capital, so the construction keeps going without stopping with three shifts. Given the speed of the progress, the company’s headquarter and industrial park in Shanghai will be fully built before the end of next year.”</p><p>“I see.” Tang Xiu smiled and said, “Once our industrial park is built and becomes operational, the Magnificent Tang Corp. can really start to fully circulate the funds by then. I think you’ve been too occupied with work all this time. It’s hard on you and not a good situation. You and Andy should prepare to find your successors. I’m hoping that you’ll spend more of your time to cultivate in the future.”</p><p>“Isn’t it too early?” Kang Xia hesitated and said, “It’s only been a year and a half from founding the company until the present. More so that the company is now developing rapidly. If I and Andy were to hand over our works, I’m afraid…”</p><p>“What I mean is not handing over your work right away but finding your successor,” replied Tang Xiu smilingly. “At least, you must train a trustworthy person as your confidant. You must also foster their work ethics and abilities and comprehend their understanding about the Magnificent Tang Corporation. Plan it for a year and a half or so. Once our headquarters and industrial park in Shanghai have been fully built, you can hand over your works whenever you’ve stabilized the situation.”</p><p>“I know. I already plan to do that too.” Kang Xia nodded and said, “You can rest assured that Andy and I won’t neglect our cultivation.”</p><p>“In fact, I really want to hug you and get some sleep peacefully.” Tang Xiu smiled lightly and said, “It’s just unfortunate that my schedule is so tight. I need to bring some people to Nine Dragons Island overnight. Alright, go have some rest. I’ll be back soon and allocate some time to accompany you later.”</p><p>After half an hour, the disciples of the Tang Sect had boarded the buses and quickly arrived at a certain port in Jingmen Island. The passenger liner then set sail and quickly disappeared into the dark sea.</p><p>This time, the route wasn’t planned to head straight to Saipan. Despite the help of the Chinese authorities forcing various forces to leave, the information released by the Celestial Wizard Clan had made many forces furious even though they eventually left. But some forces were still not convinced and sent some people to stay in Saipan to investigate. Even some liners were still seen wandering about and on the lookout in the Pacific Ocean.</p><p>After returning to Nine Dragons Island, Tang Xiu immediately issued a reorganization order and provided a number of cultivation resources. Just as he was about to busy himself and see Gu Yan’er, the travel-worn Jin Shi rushed back from the outside. To Tang Xiu’s surprise, he was badly battered and injured and some Tang Sect disciples who followed him were even more seriously injured. If it wasn’t for their Holy Healing pills, they would’ve already died outside.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
