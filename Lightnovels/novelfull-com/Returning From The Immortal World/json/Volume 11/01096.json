While standing in the air, he glared at the old man and proudly said, “You got that right. It was done by my Stygian Club. But what about it? You’re nothing but suicidal idiots, trying to control Saipan through underground forces, huh? That’s some moron’s dream, I tell you. Witness and behold, for we’ll remove your foothold in Saipan today, and soon, a lot of warriors of the Stygian Club will root out any strongholds you have in the world and even raze your nest to the ground!”</p><p>“DAMN YOU!!!”</p><p>The black-masked old man instantly appeared in front of Varela. His pair of white-gloved hands instantly hit the latter’s chest. Varela screamed as a golden thread appeared and wrapped his neck. The silk thread hanged him 100 meters high in the air.</p><p>The old man then tore off the mask on his face, revealing his sorrowful face as he roared into the sky, “Stygian Club’s evil bastards! My only son is dead in your hands. From now on, it will either you all or I who die!!!”</p><p>The tens of experts from the Stygian Club immediately soared up to the sky upon seeing Varela hanged up in the sky. Some figures flickered and appeared before the old man in the blink of an eye. Using a combination of various techniques, they ganged up on the latter in an attempt to save the dying Varela.</p><p>“You want him? Take it!!”</p><p>The old man swayed his hand and the golden silk thread instantly cut off Varela’s neck. His feet fiercely kicked the latter’s head, causing the bloody head to fling to the hands of a Stygian Club expert.”</p><p>“FINISH HIM OFF!!!”</p><p>The attack of these few people turned ballistic, leaving no spot for the old man to dodge and flee. Bleeding wounds kept appearing on his aged body, although fortunately, his speed was fast enough to avoid dangers whenever he fell into a dire situation.</p><p>At this time, more than ten cars appeared in the distance heading fast toward the Speeder Club’s HQ manor. As the cars’ doors were opened, a lot of figures flickered and moved lightning-fast toward the building. The two figures that emitted out the strongest auras flew up and immediately appeared next to the besieged old man.</p><p>“You guys finally came! Kill these Stygian bastards first to avenge my son!” The old man looked ecstatic and shouted aloud.</p><p>“KILL!”</p><p>“KILL!!”</p><p>The two men didn’t speak and straightly launched fierce attacks and gave heavy pressure to the several powerhouses of the Stygian Club.</p><p>In the building, Jameson could only see a flash of light in front of him at the moment when the reinforcements arrived. One of the four experts of the Stygian Club who ganged up on him was instantly killed, while the other three were forced backward.</p><p>“KILL!”</p><p>Jameson brandished the long blade and aggressively charged forward. As a man who could become the Speeder Union’s leader and ranked as one of the top Bosses in Saipan, this was proof of his abilities and bravery.</p><p>Puff…</p><p>Suddenly, a throwing knife was shot lightning fast at his back and pierced straight into his left chest and stabbed his heart.</p><p>“H-how… can this be?!!”</p><p>Jameson abruptly slammed back and looked down at the bloody hole on his chest in disbelief, his whole body turning cold. He had always been wary and careful, fighting so hard until the reinforcement had arrived. And yet, how could he suffer such a fatal attack at this time?</p><p>He could barely move his sight upward. When he saw a white-haired old man smiling before him, it was like he was looking at the smiling Grim Reaper.</p><p>“The Stygian Club’s Iron Raven.”</p><p>Desperation was cast on Jameson’s face after identifying who the old man before him was. Even before he died, he realized that all the Speeder Union’s members would be going to hell. Regardless of how much manpower the reinforcements could offer, only miserable death awaited them no matter who came today.</p><p>It was because this man was the Iron Raven. Even if the attacker who raided the Speeder Union’s HQ consisted only of this Iron Raven, it was likely that everyone here would die.</p><p>Iron Raven grinned strangely as he brandished the silver hook weapon in his hand, killing two experts from St. James Company. Immediately after, his figure flickered and kept appearing next to Jameson’s men and St. James’ members. Each of his strikes claimed a soul, and not even those who injected themselves with genetic agents were spared.</p><p>“RUN!!!”</p><p>A St. James expert who was on par with a cultivator at the Foundation Establishment Stage immediately shouted after finding out Iron Raven’s identity. At this moment, his figure had already bolted outside, only to find that his companions had already been encircled by some Stygian Club experts. He hurriedly shouted, “Abandon the Speeder Union and escape at once!”</p><p>“We’re escaping?!!”</p><p>The old man in mid-air and the two experts with formidable aura were slightly stunned. At this moment in time, some of the Stygian Club experts seemed to seize the chance. They didn’t launch any attack and instantly ran toward the building.</p><p>The old man looked suffocated with fury and roared. “William!!! You fucking asshole! My son is dead in their hands. But we’re now much stronger in numbers than them. Why must we run now? Do you not believe I’ll kill you myself…”</p><p>The expert called William immediately looked bitter upon hearing the furious curse from the old man. Escaping had been the last thing in his mind before, but who would have thought the Stygian Club turned out to have dispatched that Iron Raven? Everyone knew that even the Gold-rank Assassins must obey this man’s command since he was their commander. This man was also known as one of the top 10 in the Stygian Club.</p><p>“JUST RUN!!!”</p><p>He didn’t spare more time to explain and just bolted away lightning-fast.</p><p>Puff…</p><p>A flying knife as fast as a shooting star pierced his back all of a sudden. At the moment of his screaming, the clown-masked Iron Raven’s figure flickered and appeared behind his back as his hand quickly controlled the machete he picked up to quickly hover around William and cut off his neck.</p><p>The old man and two St. James experts who were tens of meters away from them looked horrified upon witnessing William’s tragic fate. They finally realized why the latter urged them to escape. It was because the clown-masked guy was really terrible. They all knew William’s strength that was on par with them, and yet, he had been killed that easily.</p><p>“RUN!!!”</p><p>The old man and two experts of St. James hastily fled. They didn’t even bother to take care of the rest of their companions.</p><p>Iron Raven hummed and smirked strangely as he flung toward the old man lightning-fast. He threw out the silver hook weapon, instantly piercing the latter’s neck. After striking him, the silver hook unexpectedly returned to his hand automatically.</p><p>“Hold them back!”</p><p>Iron Raven let out a bizarre shout. The two golden-robed middle-aged men suddenly appeared in front of the two experts of St. James Company.</p><p>“Gold-rank Assassins?!! Shit! An expert who can command the Stygian Club’s gold-rank Assassins?! He… he’s Iron Raven!!!” The two St. James powerhouses looked desperate and fought desperately to push back the two Gold-rank Assassins, only to be disappointed. Not only were these two Gold-rank Assassins powerful, but they also had the strength to fight them on equal ground.</p><p>Four-plus kilometers away from the scene.</p><p>Inside the building, the old man with a scar on his mouth lowered the high-powered telescope in his hand and ordered. “The time is almost up. Notify our men to immediately kill those Stygian Club bastards! Keep in mind, you’ll reap more rewards the more you kill!”</p><p>“Understood!”</p><p>Tens of experts in night black suits rushed outside. But the battle-hardened stalwart man quickly took out a mobile phone and dialed a number. “Move now!”</p><p>In the vicinity of the Speeder Union’s HQ.</p><p>Tang Xiu stood by the window and silently watched the unfolding scene of the battle in mid-air. He didn’t expect that the battle between the underground forces in Saipan could lead to the emergence of so many experts. Apart from the rest of the combatants, the old man who appeared late had the strength comparable to a mid-stage Golden Core cultivator.</p><p>“This is getting more and more interesting.”</p><p>Just as he prepared to join in the fray, his face slightly shifted all of a sudden. He instantly released his perception before retracting it back instantly.</p><p>Tom Reggie, who had long waited for the end of the Ravengale, immediately looked excited upon hearing Tang Xiu’s words and hurriedly asked, “Are we going to attack now, Boss?”</p><p>Tang Xiu stretched out a smile and shook his head. “This evening is very lively, isn’t it? Well, I admit that I neglected some things and failed to notice them in advance. Let’s just wait for now! The true fight has just begun, and it’s destined that the ground is going to be littered by corpses and dyed red tonight!”</p><p>“Huh?” Tom Reggie was confused. “What do you mean, Boss? I don’t get it. The Ravengale has broken the last line of defense of the Speeder Union, and even their reinforcements are being massacred now. It won’t take more than a few minutes for them all to be slain. You can say this moment is the best time to strike them. Why haven’t you issued an order to attack, though?”</p><p>“The best time to strike? Heng…” Tang Xiu sneered. “I give you a minute, Tom. You’ll know what I meant.”</p><p>Having said that, he no longer bothered with Tom Reggie and picked up the binoculars to observe the situation around the Speeder Union’s HQ. Although some bunkers were obstructing the intense fight in the interior, Tang Xiu could tell the situation of the battle based on the constantly flickering figures coming into his line of sight from time to time.</p><p>Prior to this, he thought that since the Speeder Union had a batch of reinforcements, it would change the ending of the battle. But he never expected that the Ravengale would also have such a very powerful expert that ultimately affected the entire situation.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
