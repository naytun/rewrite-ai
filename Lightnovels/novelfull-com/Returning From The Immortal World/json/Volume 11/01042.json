Relying only on his perception to avoid the bullets unnoticed, he kept rescuing the injured victims. Aside from the more than a million viewers who were watching Tian Xiaomeng’s live channel, there were also thousands of people hiding in spots in the nearby streets with eyes trained on him.</p><p>These eyes were full of worry and concern, yet also filled with respect!</p><p>These were the true expressions that came from their inner hearts.</p><p>In the meantime, there was also Wang Hai, a Deputy Director of the Public Security Bureau of Jinfan District of Beijing. He also once served in the professional army for four-odd years as a special soldier of a special task force and possessed extraordinary skills. After receiving the alarm he led the police force of his department and a small SWAT team there.</p><p>However, it was beyond his expectation that these murderers would be this difficult to deal with. Despite being a skilled gunman and being able to kill several murderers, the battle was still in a deadlock. He already asked for reinforcement from his superiors, but the number of the policeman who arrived in the last few minutes was not many, totaling only a little over forty.</p><p>“Who is he?”</p><p>While leaning behind a police car and watching Tang Xiu hide behind the crashed car, Wang Hai’s face was that of respect and yet puzzlement upon seeing the young man treating many seriously injured victims. To encounter such a doctor that was even braver than the field doctors back when he was in the army was something he never dreamed of.</p><p>Next to him was another policeman who was also hiding behind the police car. He replied, “Chief Wang, his name is Tang Xiu, a very famous Chinese medicine doctor in our country. He’s also hailed as a Divine Doctor by ordinary people. I just didn’t expect that he isn’t afraid to rush to save people amid this intense gun battle, ignoring the danger.”</p><p>Sure enough. He’s a doctor!</p><p>The respect Wang Hai felt inside deepened and he said with a deep voice, “It would be a blessing to our people if all the doctors in China were like him. Let’s not speak about him now and just hope that he can ensure his own safety. Hurry up and contact our superiors and ask for more reinforcement!”</p><p>“Roger!”</p><p>The policeman replied. But just as he touched the comms, he suddenly looked puzzled because he was keenly aware that the number of bullets fired from the opposite side was decreasing, thus the sound of gunfire reduced a lot.</p><p>‘What’s going on? Could it be that they run out of ammo?’</p><p>At this moment, Wang Hai could also sense the situation. He carefully poked his head out to observe the surroundings for a while, doubt and suspicion arising inside him. Aside from the last man of the opposite side who still kept shooting, the rest of them were all silent.</p><p>‘This is bad! Are they running away?’</p><p>As he thought to this point, Wang Hai suddenly shouted, “Some of you come with me! Follow me over there. This incident is already so damn shitty, we must not let any of these murderers run away!”</p><p>Four armed policemen immediately followed Wang Hai and quickly circled around in another direction. A few minutes later, they appeared behind the murderers’ position. But at this time, the last gunshots had already ended.</p><p>‘What exactly is going on?’</p><p>With a head full of suspicions and puzzlement, Wang Hai quickly sprinted forward. When he saw the murderers’ cars, each of the men had fallen to the ground and it was unknown whether they still lived or died. With disbelief and incredulity in his eyes, he carried out a fast check and found no more murderers resisting.</p><p>“Go go go!”</p><p>Wang Hai took the lead and quickly sprinted to the murderers’ car. He grabbed the handcuffs lightning-fast and quickly cuffed them. Further, he called the rest of the policemen on the opposite side to move over quickly, causing more than a dozen murderers to be apprehended in just a few minutes.</p><p>However, all the murderers had fainted by the time they caught them. Aside from one man whose arms were pierced by a dagger, no one else had even a single injury.</p><p>‘This… is too bizarre.’</p><p>After falling into silence for a long while, only then did Wang Hai walk towards Tang Xiu. Although he admired Tang Xiu very much, he still shouted at him angrily, “You’re Doctor Tang, right? What you did was really reckless! Don’t you know you just took a big risk by rushing into danger while saving the injured?”</p><p>At this time, Tang Xiu was still treating a seriously injured man. Upon hearing Wang Hai’s angry shout, a smile appeared on his handsome face. He looked up, shook his head and then continued treating the gravely injured man.</p><p>Seeing Tang Xiu’s response, Wang Hai immediately frowned and said in dissatisfaction, “I know that you’re a brave man and also have a good heart. But you must know that you can’t make fun of your own life. You would have died already under the murderers’ guns if you got unlucky. You… you’re just acting willfully and making a scene.”</p><p>This time, Tang Xiu slightly furrowed his brows in response and then treated the seriously injured man at his fastest speed. After stabilizing his wounds, he quickly went towards Wang Hai, then took out the green book and shook it before his face. Then, he quickly put it away and said, “It’s my duty to save lives and the injured, and it’s also my responsibility to defuse the crisis. Those murderers have been dealt with and it’s now your turn to hurry up and take care of the aftermath. Also, I have a piece of advice for you if this place is under your jurisdiction: immediately seal this place and stop all the residents from taking photos and videos. If this incident were to spread out throughout the country, then I’m afraid those at the top will be very furious.”</p><p>Wang Hai looked at Tang Xiu with incredulity. The green book Tang Xiu just took out made his heart thump faster.</p><p>“Yes, Sir! Consider it done, Sir!”</p><p>After Wang Hai saluted, he immediately summoned the policemen under his command and sealed off all the neighborhood around as per Tang Xiu’s instructions, and prohibited everyone from taking photos and videos. He was also perfectly aware of one thing. This incident was so big that even if they went all out to block the news, suppressing it was nigh on impossible since today was, after all, the age of media where anything could be spread out through the Internet in no time.</p><p>Tang Xiu then looked around and found several people injured in the crashed cars. He stopped paying attention to everything else and began treating the victims as quickly as possible.</p><p>Inside the Big Golden Eagle Store.</p><p>Standing by the window on the sixth floor, Tian Xiaomeng’s face was full of excitement. Tears were still seen on her face, but her face was beaming with a smile as she continued the live broadcast. “Dear friends, the gun battle is over. Although I still don’t know how those villains were dealt with, the police force has arrested them. This is definitely a happy event for all of us. My idol, Mr. Tang, is also safe and sound. He has saved so many wounded people under the rain of bullets, but he didn’t get injured at all. I think God must have pitied his endeavor and blessed him.”</p><p>As of now, the number of viewers watching her live broadcast had exceeded two million. Every one of them typed their admiration for Tang Xiu and expressed their anger and hatred towards the murderers while listening to Tian Xiaomeng.</p><p>However, during the live broadcasting, a hazy figure appeared behind Tian Xiaomeng and a sharp dagger suddenly pierced the mobile phone in her hand. Tang 28 stomped the phone right as it fell on the floor.</p><p>Tian Xiaomeng instantly turned around and looked at Tang 28 with a horrified look. However, when he saw that the person was only an eight-plus-years-old child, her horrified look was instantly gone and she scolded a bit angrily. “Hey, what are you doing? You’re still a child yet you pierced my phone with a dagger? You… where are your parents, kid? I’ll take you to your parents and ask for their explanation!”</p><p>“My Sovereign has a lot to deal with and he asked me to tell you that he has no time to deal with you for the time being,” said Tang 28 with a cold voice. “He said that you’ll be in trouble for your live broadcast, and told you to shape up!”</p><p>Tian Xiaomeng caught up with him in a few steps, blocked his way, and angrily said, “What nonsense are you talking about? Did your head got screwed up or something? Who’s your Sovereign? Why does he have things to do about me and my live broadcast, huh? Take me to your parents and pay for my phone!”</p><p>Tang 28 was silent for a moment and then took out a stack of hundred-yuan bills from his pocket. He threw them to Tian Xiaomeng and said, “10,000 yuan should be enough to compensate for your loss. I don’t feel like telling you who my Sovereign is. Just wait here and you’ll be fine after some troubles.”</p><p>Having said that, he brushed past Tian Xiaomeng and ran away quickly. Tian Xiaomeng was unable to stop him even though she wanted to. She just stood in the corridor, looking at the stack of hundred-yuan bills in her hand with twitching lips. She felt like she wanted to cry hard yet the tears wouldn’t come out of her eyes.</p><p>She didn’t care about the money. What she cared about was her live broadcast. Yet, she got interrupted all of a sudden. She could tell that the two million viewers in her live broadcast channel must be going ballistic now.</p><p>At the crossroads.</p><p>As an ambulance arrived, Tang Xiu, who had stabilized all the injuries of the gravely injured victims, walked to Wang Hai under the gaze of countless people and calmly said, “I have some private matters to talk to you about.”</p><p>“Okay,” replied Wang Hai hurriedly.</p><p>After a short while, the two of them came to a secluded spot a dozen meters away. Wang Hai curiously looked at Tang Xiu and said, “What do you want to talk to me about, Divine Doctor Tang?”</p><p>“You already know my identity, but I want you to not publicize it,” said Tang Xiu. “Also, the people who neutralized those murderers are my men. If those at the top want to conduct a thorough investigation, tell them to come to me. I’ll be at the Tang Family’s ancestral residence for the next few days.”</p><p>Wang Hai was truly shocked deep down since he didn’t expect that the people who solved more than a dozen of those murderers turned out to be Tang Xiu’s men. He didn’t even notice nor see their shadows at all. However, upon noticing that Tang Xiu didn’t want to explain further, he forced himself to ask again, “May I ask which Tang Family’s residence you just told me about, Divine Doctor Tang?”</p><p>“Huh? How many Tang Families are there in the capital?” asked Tang Xiu with a light smile.</p><p>“Tang…” Wang Hai opened his mouth as his pupils suddenly contracted. With a shocked face, he asked again, “You… you’re from that Tang House?”</p><p>“My surname is Tang, so of course, I’m a member of the Tang House.” Tang Xiu chuckled and said, “Anyways, I already told you everything I needed to say. There are things you can say and things you cannot. Shortly put, just deal with things here. I can’t stay any longer since I gotta get back to celebrate my grandfather’s 80th birthday.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
