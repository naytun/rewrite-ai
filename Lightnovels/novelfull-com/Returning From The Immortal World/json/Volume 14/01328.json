Of course, I won’t stop you from leaving if you scram now.”</p><p>Ao Xiang glared at Tang Xiu and then shouted, “Fine, let’s leave!”</p><p>With that said, his group shot a cold glare at Sendoya again before he flew to the distance.</p><p>Tang Xiu slightly smiled and returned Zenith Venerable and Seaway Monarch to the Heavenly Abode. Then he looked at Sendoya and said, “Remember my name and my empire. If you have no place left for you here in the future, come to the Great Empire and look for me. I can provide you shelter.”</p><p>Having said that, he didn’t give Sendoya a chance to reply and ordered the Cloudpiercer beasts to continue their journey.</p><p>Sendoya and the dozens of Blood Elves watched Tang Xiu leave with complex expressions. As a matter of fact, it wasn’t that they didn’t want to leave this place. But they were still holding on the spark of hope in their hearts that the Blood Elves could return to their peak in this place.</p><p>“Chief, I think…”</p><p>A male Blood Elf wearing a red cape and red armor hesitantly said.</p><p>Sendoya raised her hand to interrupt him and indifferently said, “I know what you want to say. But this place is our home and we can’t just leave this place unless we come to an impasse here. Further, do we even know where this Great Tang Empire and who this Great Tang Heavenly Emperor is? We know nothing about him, so we can’t promise him.”</p><p>The Immortal World.</p><p>The region was a world of ice and snow with snowflakes dancing in the sky amidst the breeze and the standing glaciers. The ground was but layers of thick ice, and only a few plants suitable for this environment added some vitality to this ice and snow world.</p><p>Crack…</p><p>Above the night sky, a flash of lightning appeared out of the blue. Along with the lightning bolts traversing in the void, a distressed figure crushed down from the slit in the vault of heaven and fell on the hard ice.</p><p>The figure was Han Qingwu. She just ascended from Earth to the Immortal World and used her spatial divine ability during her ascent and finally appeared here. At the moment, she was covered with blood and her white attire was bloodied and ragged.</p><p>Cough, cough…</p><p>After a long while, Han Qingwu struggled to get up from the ice ground. Her body slightly shivered as she looked around. Eventually, a faint smile appeared on her bloodstained face.</p><p>“I finally came back! A bit later than him, right?”</p><p>Han Qingwu gently raised her hand and mist appeared around her. Shortly after, all the bloodstains on her body were washed away and her tattered long robe was blasted out. She then instantly put on white combat attire.</p><p>Suddenly, her expression slightly shifted and looked vigilant. She could sense a huge aura coming fast from the distant horizon. Hardly with any hesitation, her figure quickly bolted away as fast as lightning towards the nearby iceberg. In nearly a flash, her figure had merged into the iceberg.</p><p>Whoosh…</p><p>A raging gale roared and a dark blue figure suddenly appeared out of nowhere right at the spot where Han Qingwu just stood. A chilling aura emanated out of the body of this person while his sharp eyes slowly swept around. He then frowned and muttered, “A breath of life was clearly here. How can it disappear so quickly? Did someone with remarkable divine ability come here?”</p><p>After a few minutes, he shook his head secretly and flickered away.</p><p>10 days later, a deep hole was blown out from the inside on the iceberg. The injuries on Han Qingwu’s body were no more. She then turned into a streak of light that shot towards the distance.</p><p>She must find him. But she didn’t worry that she couldn’t find him at all.</p><p>Based on her understanding about him, Han Qingwu was well aware that bloodbath and battles always occurred no matter where he went. Moreover, he came back for revenge this time, so as long as she paid attention to some major events in the Immortal World, she believed that she could find his trail.</p><p>Han Qingwu never wanted to disturb him, but she wanted to look at him from afar. Just… watching… and nothing else. It was enough for her.</p><p>****</p><p>The Immortal World, Immortal Lyceum.</p><p>The Immortal Lyceum had a wide area of influence, and the vast Immortal Domain was under the control of Apotheosis Immortal Bella Fern Regalia. However, the entire territory of Immortal Lyceum had become extremely chaotic in the past hundred years since Apotheosis Immortal Bella was involved in a war for centuries and was gravely injured.</p><p>Amidst the endless void.</p><p>Four endless roads spread towards the void, and at the intersection of the four roads was the Immortal Domain’s landmass. The landmass itself was not very large but still in the range of millions of kilometers. Above this landmass was a building with carved beams and rich ornaments.</p><p>Whoosh…</p><p>A fast-moving figure flickered lightning-fast from the southwestern road and quickly landed outside the vortex portal connected to the landmass. Wearing a silver tabard and silver combat boots, the long silver-haired figure emanated the aura of a Perfected Golden Immortal.</p><p>“Pays respect to Apotheon Mu!”</p><p>Dozens of Immortal soldiers guarding outside the vortex gate all saluted to the visitors.</p><p>Apotheon Mu slowly nodded and lunged into the vortex portal. He stepped on the red floating clouds in the sky and then came to the square outside the towering palace in the middle. As a valiant female immortal appeared, he asked in a deep voice, “How is the injury of Apotheosis Immortal Bella?”</p><p>The female Immortal answered, “Her injury is quite serious. If we can’t find a Holy Dragon Fruit within a hundred years, I’m afraid…”</p><p>Apotheon Mu frowned deeply and said, “I’d like to see her.”</p><p>The female Immortal hesitated. “Her Ladyship has ordered that if there’s no…”</p><p>“Let him come in!”</p><p>A faint, misty voice came from the interior of the palace.</p><p>Apotheon Mu gently nodded to the female immortal and then entered the palace instantly. As his figure appeared inside, he looked up at the Nine Dragons Cathedra where the pale-faced Apotheosis Immortal Bella sat cross-legged on. He let out a bitter smile and greeted. “Senior Venerable, there’s no need for you to do this!”</p><p>Apotheosis Immortal Bella Fern Regalia had a beautiful face, looking like she was in her 30s with snow-white fair skin and soul-stirring beauty. Her pale, slender fingers stroked her temples as she calmly said, “He once said that the Great Dao originates from the heart and my Dao is the path of my feelings. He may have been heartless to me, but I can never be heartless to him. Even if he’s dead, I still want to crush the Demon in my heart.”</p><p>“Senior Venerable, some things are meant to never be fulfilled. Besides, Master has already vanished both in flesh and soul. Even though you persevere and keep insisting, no good results will come to you. Why not let everything go?” Apotheon Immortal Mu sighed.</p><p>“Just let everything go? Can I just put everything down?” Apotheosis Bella’s eyes burst with intense killing intent and she shouted with a miserable voice, “He may have died, but those he cared about are still there! Those treacherous bastards have yet to get annihilated, so how can I just put everything down?”</p><p>Apotheon Mu was silent for a moment and then slowly said, “Junior Martial Brother Sirius is dead. I just received the news that he died in the hands of White Guillotine Venerable under Great Emperor Danqing.”</p><p>Apotheosis Bella was reticent for a long while before speaking with a bit hoarse voice, “Sirius has an arrogant character and he never wanted to stay still in the Vermillion Bird Holy Sect. Over the past 7 centuries, he killed countless men under Great Emperor Danqing, so he had long been regarded as a thorn in their eyes. I have long expected that he’d be killed.”</p><p>Apotheon Mu said, “Senior Venerable, you’ve also slaughtered countless enemies all these years, they may have regarded you as a thorn in their eyes as well. Although you’ve broken through to the Supremacy Stage, you’re now gravely injured. Just in case…”</p><p>“Don’t worry.” Apotheosis Bella shook his head and said, “Your Master was the one who arranged the arrays that protect this place. Unless Great Emperor Danqing and Zither Demon Jiuyao themselves come together, nobody else among them can destroy the Immortal arrays of this place. It’s you who can be easily spied on by them since you often travel from the Misty Spring Ocean to here.”</p><p>“This time, I’m in need of the Luminous Nacre Fan in your hand,” said Apotheon Mu.</p><p>Apotheosis Bella’s complexion changed and she shouted in a deep voice, “I know what you are going to do by asking the Luminous Nacre Fan from me. But I’ll never give it to you and I’ll never allow you to take risks! Those four are now being suppressed under the Heavenly Mountain in order to lure you there. With your strength, you’re only going to enter their trap!”</p><p>“But I still must go.” Apotheon Mu said in a heavy voice, “They’re all my Martial Brothers and the last of Master’s disciples. I’m willing to even throw my life there as long as I can rescue the four of them.”</p><p>“No!” Apotheosis Bella shook her head and said, “I can feel at ease if you break through to the Supremacy Stage. After all, even if you fail to rescue them, you still have some assurances to get away. But you’re just a Perfected Golden Immortal and going there will only bring about your own death! Apotheon Mu, listen to my advice. Go back to Misty Spring Ocean and devote yourself to cultivation. They will never be able to break through the protection arrays of the Vermillion Bird Holy Sect within a thousand years. They won’t be able to kill everyone there. The greatest help you can offer to them over there is only when you’ve broken through to the Supremacy Stage!”</p><p>Apotheon Mu shook his head and said, “Breaking through to the Supremacy Stage within a thousand years is just impossible for me. Senior Venerable, I’ve already made up my mind that I’m going to the Convict Arena to buy 10 Perfected Golden Immortal gladiators. I’m going to rescue my Martial Brothers with them. Only then can I have face to see Respectable Master.”</p><p>Apotheosis Bella stared at Apotheon Mu’s firm expression before she finally waved her long sleeves and threw the Luminous Nacre Fan to him. Then, she helplessly said, “I’m seriously injured now and I can’t help you. But if you can wait some more time, it’s best to wait more. I’ll take you there myself when my injury is healed.”</p><p>“Thank you, Senior Venerable.”</p><p>Apotheon Mu bowed and saluted before turning and heading outside. When he was about to reach the gate, his pace suddenly halted and he turned to look at Apotheosis Bella, saying, “I’m going back to Misty Spring Ocean and immediately help you find the Holy Dragon Fruit. I’m going to Heavenly Mountain after I have found it.”</p><p>“You’re free to do whatever you want. But I hope that no matter what, you don’t get into dangers easily,” said Apotheosis Bella. “There are still many people in the vast Immortal World that need your protection.”</p><p>“I understand.” Apotheon Mu turned around and flew out.</p><p>On the Nine Dragons Cathedra.</p><p>Apotheosis Bella looked sad and muttered to herself, “What a heartless and ungrateful man you are. You just walk away and leave so much debt behind…”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
