However, it was not the kind of rodent-like creature on Earth. She was an offspring of the Dragon and Feline races and possessed both Dragon and Feline bloodlines. As far as Tang Xiu knew, the number of Dragon Felines in the entire Immortal World was absolutely not over 3 digits.</p><p>Back in the past, he also had the Dragon Feline through some kind of immortal fate and grace.</p><p>Kitty gently grabbed Tang Xiu’s arm with a pleading look and said, “Master, can you also buy Raging Lion Daybreak? He saved me once and kept saving me in Convict Arena prison intentionally.”</p><p><em>Raging Lion Daybreak?</em></p><p>Tang Xiu nodded at her plea and said, “Follow me.”</p><p>Along the way, Tang Xiu observed the remaining hundreds of deathmatch fighters and read their information before he finally came to a bearded Lionman with a golden hairy body. The Lionman didn’t show any menacing gestures towards Tang Xiu, but showing a smile instead when he saw Kitty beside Tang Xiu.</p><p><em>1.2 million Immortal Crystals? He’s a Profound Immortal?</em></p><p>After reading his records, Tang Xiu slightly frowned but then calmly said, “Wait here. I’ll take you away too.”</p><p>Having said that, he took the feline girl back to the auditorium. As a new match was about to begin, Tang Xiu took out 100,000 Immortal Crystals and gave them to the feline girl and said, “Bet for the win of that hulking guy.”</p><p>“Okay!”</p><p>Kitty left for a while and soon returned to Tang Xiu and handed a token worth 100,000 Immortal Crystals.</p><p>“You hold it,” Tang Xiu calmly said.</p><p>The match ended quickly as it started with the Hulk ending up the winner.</p><p>In the next two days, Tang Xiu gambled for a total of six times. The initial 100,000 Immortal Crystals kept doubling until the number reached 6.4 million Immortal Crystals.</p><p><em>This should be enough.</em></p><p>Tang Xiu took a deep breath and then returned to the iron cage where the Lionman was caged. He then paid 1.2 million Immortal Crystals to the manager of the Convict Arena prison to buy the Lionman.</p><p>As the old man manager left, Tang Xiu took another look at the Lionman and said with all seriousness, “I’m giving you two choices now. First, I give your Life Token back and you can leave if you wish so. Second, you follow me later, but I must make it clear to you that I’ll have your Life Token. Make your choice here and now.”</p><p>The Lionman knelt on one knee and said in a deep voice, “I’d only meet my death here sooner or later if you didn’t save. My life is yours since you’re my benefactor. I’d like to leave now, but I’ll pay back ten or even 100 times for the grace you gave me in the future.”</p><p>Tang Xiu gave him his Life Token and lightly said, “Every person has his own will and purpose. You chose to leave, so I won’t force you to follow me. Further, I don’t need you to pay back.”</p><p>The Lionman spoke no more and just received his Life Token. He saluted Tang Xiu and then left quickly. He didn’t ask why Tang Xiu saved him, but he could faintly guess that it might be the request to that Kitty. In short, he vowed to remember this benevolence in his heart and would look for this benefactor after completing an important matter he must deal with.</p><p>Watching his back disappear into the distance, Tang Xiu then shifted to Kitty. Fate brought them to meet here and Tang Xiu decided to leave this place. After all, he had gained a lot of things this time and had no plan to gain more Immortal Crystals in this place anymore. He didn’t dare to guarantee 100% that he could win every time gambled. No matter how minuscule such a chance may occur, just one mistake was enough to lose all he had gained.</p><p>Quickly after, Tang Xiu brought Kitty to the Aurelian Artificer Sect. After the pair entered the lava cave abode, Tang Xiu asked, “Kitty, back when I left in the Immortal World, you weren’t yet able to shapeshift. I know some of the things that happened in the Immortal World later on, but I only know a few things. Tell me what you’ve been through.”</p><p>Kitty replied, “Master, I heard that you failed your Divine Tribulation. Afterward, your two friends occupied our residence and even sent a large number of experts to kill, burn, and plunder it. I didn’t have the ability to shapeshift before, so I avoided the disaster. I wandered about everywhere for 800 years, but then encountered an accident. I was captured and my Life Source and Soul Essence were absorbed before I was sent to the city’s Convict Arena Prison. Due to the awakening of my Dragon bloodline, I was then sent to the match and defeated my opponents many times to survive. Later on, a certain Immortal from the Convict Arena prison saw that I could advance to be an Immortal rank Magical Beast. Afterward, I kept fighting in the Convict Arena’s matches. Oftentimes I thought I was going to die, but I never thought I would be able to survive in the end. I have always been thinking… I’d run into you again…”</p><p>A cold glint flashed in Tang Xiu’s eyes and he asked in a deep voice, “Who caught you and absorbed your Life Source and Soul Essence?”</p><p>“He’s a voracious wolf, a despicable and shameless Profound Immortal,” answered Kitty.</p><p>“Where is he?”</p><p>“I don’t know.” Kitty shook her head and said, “I’ve been in the Convict Arena prison for more than 300 years and must go through hundreds of deathmatches. Later on, I heard he likes to capture some weak people and sells them to the Convict Arena prison in private. He seems to have a deep relationship with one of Convict Arena prison’s executives.”</p><p>“You don’t know about his background at all?” Tang Xiu asked again.</p><p>Kitty shook her head again. But she suddenly nodded and said, “He seems to be a disciple of a big sect, Master. But I don’t know the name of his sect.”</p><p>Tang Xiu patted her shoulder and lightly said, “If I can return to the peak one day, I’ll definitely assign some people to find him and give him to you at his last breath.”</p><p>“Thank you, Master.”</p><p>Kitty hugged Tang Xiu after saying this and planted her small beautiful face on Tang Xiu’s chest. At this moment, she felt that this chest was the warmest and safest place in the whole Immortal World.</p><p>Suddenly, she seemed to recall something and curiously asked, “Master, where’s Madam? I’ve asked around about Madam many times, but I’ve never been able to obtain any news about her.”</p><p>Tang Xiu’s expression turned cold and he indifferently replied, “She is no longer your Madam as she no longer has the slightest relationship with me anymore. Remember, kill her directly if she provokes you when you meet her in the future. You don’t need to bother her if she doesn’t.”</p><p>“Why?” asked Kitty with a confused face.</p><p>“Don’t ask why. Just remember what I said,” said Tang Xiu faintly.</p><p>Afterward, Tang Xiu was unwilling to chat with Kitty again. After taking out the Demon God Soul Devourer Cauldron, he began to devote himself to refining. Since all the refining materials needed to make the Versicolor Coral Garb had been readied, Tang Xiu refined a total of 20 high-grade Versicolor Coral Garbs in one go.</p><p>A few months later, when Tang Xiu left the lava cave abode, he saw Gu Yan’er sitting cross-legged outside. After questioning her, he then learned that the four ancestors of the Aurelian Artificer Sect and Gu Yan’er had completely exterminated the Clearwater Clan. Only one of the four ancestors of this sect was injured, whereas the rest came out unscathed.</p><p>“By the way, I didn’t expect the Clearwater Clan to have so much wealth, Master. After counting all the wealth of this clan, all of them can be exchanged for 230,000 Immortal Crystals. However, I gave all of them to the Aurelian Artificer Sect as per your instruction in exchange for the weapons equal to the value of the wealth,” concluded Gu Yan’er with a smile.</p><p>“Our Great Tang Empire is lacking all kinds of cultivation resources as of now, especially weapons.” Tang Xiu nodded and continued, “We’ll need an astronomical amount of resources to support us since we’re going to recruit troops and prepare for war in the future. I went to the Immortal Solicit City when you headed to the Clearwater Clan and gained quite a lot from the trip. Ah, right. Have you seen Kitty yet?”</p><p>“Yeah, I met her when you were refining in seclusion.” Gu Yan’er nodded and said, “But do you really trust her?”</p><p>“Yeah, she’s actually like you since I raised her too.” Tang Xiu nodded and said, “When she was just born, her parents gave her to me. They had to deal with something and knew they were going to die because of it. It’s just she hasn’t yet been able to transform back when I was plotted.”</p><p>“You know her parents?” Gu Yan’er replied with a curious face.</p><p>“Yeah, her parents and I were good friends. They saved my life once.” Tang Xiu forced a bitter smile and said, “However, they had their destiny and fate. Even if I have tried to help them several times, I was still ultimately unable to change their death in the end.”</p><p>Gu Yan’er nodded and unhurriedly said, “I’m aware that you have your own ideas, Master. But I really hope you don’t take any action that can expose your identity again. Our enemies are really too powerful. We can only reveal our true identity when our strength is as formidable as theirs.”</p><p>“No worries!” Tang Xiu patted her shoulder and said, “The one-year deadline is getting closer, and I think the Aurelian Artificer Sect is likely unable to complete our orders. We’re staying here for another three months to wait for all the things to be prepared first. I need those four Elders of this sect to help refine a certain immortal artifact.”</p><p>“Which type of immortal artifact is it?” Gu Yan’er curiously asked.</p><p>“A Heavenly Abode-type artifact,” Tang Xiu answered.</p><p>Gu Yan’er was startled inwardly and said, “But Master, you’re going to need a lot of precious materials to make a Heavenly Abode-type artifact. Further, the larger the space inside it, the bigger the spending you must prepare.”</p><p>“Well, 5 million Immortal Crystals should be enough for it, though,” Tang Xiu replied.</p><p>Gu Yan’er quickly recalled what Kitty told her. She then immediately nodded and said with a smile, “Well, you won so many Immortal Crystals from the Convict Arena prison, enough to refine such a Heavenly Abode-type artifact. I’m quite proficient in refining myself, so I’m going to help refine it too.”</p><p>“Great!” Tang Xiu slightly smiled and nodded.</p><p>Time quickly passed by and it was nearly a year and a half since Tang Xiu and Gu Yan’er left the Great Tang Empire’s warriors. After collaborating with the four ancestors of the Aurelian Artificer Sect, Tang Xiu and Gu Yan’er finally completed the refining of the Heavenly Abode-type artifact.</p><p>The Heavenly Abode-type artifact was shaped like a ship and was large enough to accommodate 1 million people. The inner part was partitioned into 10 areas. Although the cultivation speed when cultivating inside it paled in comparison to some heavenly blessed lands, the speed couldn’t be said as low as before given the massive number of Immortal Stones and Crystals being provided.</p><p>“Let’s depart and set off on our journey.”</p><p>Finally, after the Aurelian Artificer Sect had finished refining all the weapons ordered by Tang Xiu, Tang Xiu went to see Darknorth Immortal and the four Sects ancestors and bade them farewell. Given the distance between the Aurelian Artificer Sect and the camp of the Great Tang Empire’s legions of soldiers, the journey would still take months even though Gu Yan’er led them with her Golden Immortal Stage cultivation.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
