As the duo was just less than 10 meters away from that Golden Immortal, she flicked her finger and shot an Immortal Crystal driven by her Immortal Force, instantly piercing the back of that Golden Immortal. The man’s complexion greatly changed in a flash and was replaced by terror as his body was sent flying out of the bridge.</p><p>Aaaargh…</p><p>After the terrible scream, the Golden Immortal was directly killed by the terrifying restriction outside the bridge.</p><p>“By the way, how much do you know about the Inner Pill Sect and the Everlasting Palace, Sablefiend Scorpio?” asked Tang Xiu with a cold tone via voice transmission. “And how much do you know about the Myriad Sword Sect and the Hundred Poisons Sect?”</p><p>Sablefiend Scorpio’s complexion changed. “I know a little about the Everlasting Palace, but I know more about Hundred Poisons Sect. My knowledge on the Inner Pill Sect and Myriad Sword Sect is close to none. I only know that these two sects have some Perfected Golden Immortals at the helm.”</p><p>“That’s enough.” Tang Xiu nodded and sent his voice again. “Now, remember what I’m going to tell you. You are to kill anyone from those four sects should you run into them in the future. Go all out to kill the people from those four forces without exposing your identity. From now onwards, those four sects are our enemies.”</p><p>Gasp…</p><p>Despite having a cold nature and killing was like mowing grass to her, Sablefiend Scorpio couldn’t help but gasp after hearing Tang Xiu’s statement. Of those four sects, the Inner Pill Sect and the Everlasting Palace were the top sects in the Immortal World, whereas the Myriad Sword Sect and the Hundred Poison Sect were ranked at second-tier sects. Learning that she would have to face so many enemies all of a sudden, a chill run down her spine.</p><p>“Pressure will give birth to stimulation and motivation. Only by stepping on the bodies of enemies can we live longer, go further, and become stronger,” said Tang Xiu indifferently. “Certainly, it’s not like we don’t have any allies in fighting them. Should you ever run into anyone fighting them, they are our allies. Given the current situation in the Immortal World, these four sects must also have many enemies, yes?”</p><p>“That’s right. As far as I know, their biggest archenemy is the Vermillion Bird Holy Sect and the Four Sacred Palaces,” Sablefiend Scorpio replied.</p><p>Four Sacred Palaces?</p><p>Ever since returning to the Immortal World, Tang Xiu had heard of the name of this force many times. What puzzled him most was that the Four Sacred Palaces seemed to have appeared out of nowhere. There had been no instance of such a name ever existing in the past, but many powerhouses emerged from this force and they were also very hostile toward the Inner Pill Sect and the Everlasting Palace. Had it not been for the emergence of this sect, the present situation of the Vermillion Bird Holy Sect would have been much worse.</p><p>“Do you know the origin of these Four Sacred Palaces?”</p><p>Tang Xiu scrunched up his brows and asked in a low voice while walking towards the front.</p><p>“I don’t know the details of their origin. But around 600+ years ago, I ran into some people from the Four Sacred Palaces. They were fighting some powerhouses from the Myriad Sword Sect then—a very intense battle I’d say. I know that the leader of the Four Sacred Palaces was called Venerable Azure Tiger, a late-stage Perfected Golden Immortal powerhouse who is said to have the bloodline of the ancient Divine Beast Azure Dragon, and he wore the Azure Qilin Armor that time. He alone fought against four mid-stage Perfected Golden Immortals and easily dispatched them, forcing those four skillfully and injuring them continuously.”</p><p>Tang Xiu’s complexion changed. He knew a little of the situation in a more distant period and was aware of the fact that the Vermillion Bird Holy Sect was originally a branch of a super-large sect that had several divisions. Of those divisions, the Azure Dragon lineage was one of them.</p><p>The Azure Dragon, White Tiger, Vermillion Bird, Black Tortoise, and Qilin Clan were originally the Divine Beasts that acted as the Guardian Deities of that super-large sect.</p><p>Tang Xiu and Sablefiend Scorpio kept moving forward while conversing. Several people had seen Sablefiend Scorpio’s sneak attack on the Golden Immortal just now, arousing their vigilance and making them halt their advance. These people were now glaring at the duo with a stance as though they were facing formidable enemies, keeping their vigilance to guard against their sneak attack.</p><p>Within a range of several thousands of kilometers outside the manor, tens of Perfected Golden Immortals kept observing Tang Xiu and Sablefiend Scorpio’s advance. To their shock, they realized that the duo seemed very relaxed and faced no obstruction ever since they stepped on the bridge. It was like those restrictions and traps were just useless to them.</p><p>“How come all these obstructions pose nothing to them? That’s strange. Do they know where and what restrictions and traps are, by chance?”</p><p>“I don’t get it either. That’s beyond me. Do you know who these two are and where they come from? How can they just waltz through the restrictions and traps outside the manor like that? Huh? They… actually headed to the front of everyone unscathed? This…”</p><p>“They are very fast, much faster than everyone else. What the hell is going on here? Are they perhaps familiar with this place or something?”</p><p>“It’s weird indeed…”</p><p>“…”</p><p>While conversing, Tang Xiu and Sablefiend Scorpio directly crossed the long bridge and came to the square in front of the manor. There were a total of 16 puppet beasts around the square. They suddenly left their previous spots and lunged toward Tang Xiu and Sablefiend Scorpio.</p><p>“Big Dipper Revolution and Movement.”</p><p>Tang Xiu began to move in a certain pattern of footsteps. He grabbed Sablefiend Scorpio’s hand while his feet kept changing positions. The 16 puppet beasts soon lost their targets and circled around the square several times before returning to their previous spots.</p><p>“Open!”</p><p>Tang Xiu then decided to conjure a technique. Immediately after, the hundred-meter purple-gold door slowly opened. Golden rays were shining from the interior and Tang Xiu quickly led Sablefiend Scorpio directly into the gate as it slowly closed afterward.</p><p>“They went in?”</p><p>The tens of Golden Immortals and Perfected Golden Immortals on the long bridge were all dumbfounded. Some of them had been wandering here for several days, all of whom had gone up the long bridge to study the restrictions and traps, yet none of them was able to enter the manor’s gate. But the duo just waltzed in so easily. It felt like they were just strolling around their own back garden, so how could they not be dumbfounded?</p><p>Inside the manor.</p><p>To describe what it was like, it was a picturesque scene of a magnificent jade manor.</p><p>Tang Xiu himself didn’t waste his time appreciating the beauty of the manor and quickly cast some techniques and gathered each immortal artifact hanging in various spots and places. He didn’t even miss any precious ore and jewelry inlaid in the manor. All of them were collected by him.</p><p>Tang Xiu’s action was literally sweeping everything and missing nothing. He was unwilling to leave anything behind. Either he directly ingested them, or he stuffed them into his ring. To Sablefiend Scorpio’s shock, she calculated that the total value of treasures Tang Xiu had collected exceeded 100 million Crystal Essences in just half an hour.</p><p>That was 100 million Crystal Essences! A number that could make any Perfected Golden Immortal envious to death.</p><p>“Uh… that mannerism is kind of unsightly…”</p><p>Sablefiend Scorpio’s mouth twitched upon watching Tang Xiu dig out the Golden Sandstone on a wall and then stuffed it into his ring. She hesitantly said, “Master, why don’t you let me help you? Else, you may have to spend a long time gathering all the treasures here given how vast the manor is.”</p><p>“No, you’re not familiar with the situation of this place.” Tang Xiu shook his head. “If you try to collect the treasures rashly, the restrictions will definitely attack you. Just stand where you are and wait for me!”</p><p>Sablefiend Scorpio slightly frowned, but she didn’t think that Tang Xiu’s statement was false. After all, Tang Xiu could easily take her to this place, meaning that he was truly very familiar with this place. She had tried to use an Immortal Stone to shoot a Fire Bead inlaid on the pillar, yet the stone not only failed to hit it but was also straightly crushed by the restriction on the wall. Not to mention that detecting that restriction by naked eyes had been proved to be very difficult.</p><p><em>Could Master have become the successor of Drunken Immortal Supreme? Did he get the inheritance of Drunken Immortal Supreme a few days ago, so he can fully understand the situation in this Secret Palace?</em> Sablefiend Scorpio’s eyes flickered and looked at Tang Xiu with a particular expression.</p><p>Every other courtyard and literally every spot in the manor was getting cleaned-up, and Tang Xiu’s speed was getting faster and faster. He kept collecting a large number of immortal treasures and cultivation resources, storing them into his interspatial ring. After 6 days of harvesting, Tang Xiu came to the deepest part of the manor after collecting all the treasures inside the manor.</p><p>While looking at the now completely empty manor, leaving only the frames intact, Sablefiend Scorpio could only force a wry smile inwardly. <em>Even if those infamous thieves who rampaged to steal from some Holy Sect were to come here, I don’t think they’d be able to loot like this, no?</em></p><p>Tang Xiu contentedly shifted to Sablefiend Scorpio and spoke with a beaming smile, “Well, that should be all, more or less. These many resources should be enough for the expense of the Great Tang Empire for centuries. Let’s head out and leave this place to harvest some more treasures and resources elsewhere. We gotta return home fully loaded since we already entered a treasure mountain.”</p><p>With a hesitant face, Sablefiend Scorpion asked, “Master, why do you seem… very familiar with this place?”</p><p>“I told you before that this Secret Palace is like my own back garden, didn’t I?” replied Tang Xiu with a smile. “Pity that I’m not interested in the inheritance of Drunken Immortal Supreme, though. Else this entire Secret Palace would have been mine and I could have been able to take all the resources here.”</p><p>Sablefiend Scorpio’s mouth twitched yet again, but now her heart was boiling. If Master told the truth, that would mean they would have an extraordinarily rewarding harvest.</p><p>Afterward, Tang Xiu took Sablefiend Scorpio to leave the place. Just as the duo came out of the manor’s gate, tens of eyes on the long bridge suddenly shifted their attention to them.</p><p>COMMENT</p><p>With an unfazed expression, Tang Xiu said aloud, “Hey, you guys! There’s nothing inside, not even any treasure. Not to mention that those restrictions and traps inside are even more fearsome than the ones outside. This place is nothing but a death trap, so you had better leave. Don’t say that I didn’t give advice about this.”</p><p>“Did you just get a lot of treasures from the inside, brat?” a white-haired old man with a dragon-head cane meaningfully looked at Tang Xiu.</p><p>“If you really think there are some treasures in there, you can try breaking the restrictions and traps here,” said Tang Xiu lightly. “After you enter, though, I only hope that you won’t end up regretting later since you’ve wasted so much time here.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
