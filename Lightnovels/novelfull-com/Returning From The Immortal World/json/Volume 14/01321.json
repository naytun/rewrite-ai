Half of the area occupied by the Convict Arena is now allotted for commercial stores of various resources, all of which are the Convict Arena’s industries. The second half is the prison itself and the place where deathmatch fighters fight, from the weak ones to the strong ones. As for the deepest interior of the place, it’s a place or an arena for deathmatch fights between Perfected Golden Immortal gladiators…”</p><p>Through Qin Yu’s narration, Tang Xiu finally had an understanding of the situation here. It wasn’t much different from 2,000 years ago, except the chief executive here had been replaced and the other newly recruited senior management.</p><p>After walking by the shops and seeing the dazzling array of goods, Tang Xiu’s heart itched for a shopping spree, but he still managed to restrain the impulse. His main purpose in coming here was to purchase Perfected Golden Immortals, so he didn’t want to waste money on even some precious treasures now.</p><p>“Qin Yu, what about gambling? Aren’t there any differences or proportions for gambling between the various levels of fights here?” asked Tang Xiu calmly</p><p>“You’re right. Previously, the higher the level of gambling in the Convict Arena, the higher the multiple of winning money. This rule no longer applied here as it is now based on a comprehensive assessment based on the strength of each deathmatch gladiator in each prison cage, as well as their performance record, which means the odds can vary and be set at any time,” explained Qin Yu.</p><p>Tang Xiu’s eyes lit up and asked again, “So what’s the ratio of the highest odds now?”</p><p>Qin Yu thought for a while and said, “The highest odds in the last 10 years was in the fight four years ago. The odds at that time was 42 times. If you win, you’ll get 42 times of the principal amount, while losing means you get nothing. I still remember that match, which eventually caused most of the people to lose their blood and a handful to get rich overnight.”</p><p>Tang Xiu smiled and nodded. “Now, now. The Convict Arena finally got some fresh and exciting rules in place, huh? I now look even more forward to this trip. Alright, let’s move on. Take me to the Celestial Immortal prison level!”</p><p>“Understood.”</p><p>Qin Yu’s eyes turned brighter. The higher the level of the prison cell, the stronger the guests’ strength it represented. It was just common sense she learned in the Convict Arena. Therefore, she became more and more certain that this distinguished guest was definitely a powerhouse above the Immortal Stage.</p><p>At one of the numerous cells.</p><p>When Tang Xiu’s group led by Qin Yu entered the portal, they saw two Celestial Immortals in an intense fight in the far direction and the auditorium was boiling in excitement.</p><p>The screams, the swearing, and cheers could all be heard at the same time.</p><p>Still wearing a serene expression while being guided by Qin Yu, Tang Xiu read the records of 360 deathmatch gladiators in this prison cage. After reading them, he then came to the auditorium and randomly found a seat.</p><p>Only a handful of lucky people were trying their hands on such a gambling match by relying only on their experience and analysis. Although Tang Xiu’s present strength was very weak, he still had his experience and vision as a Supreme, so he could easily judge which Celestial Immortal gladiator was stronger and which one was weak.</p><p>“Battle Peng, you stay with me, the four you can play! I’m giving each of you 1 million Immortal Crystals. I don’t care if you lose, but you can take 10% from the win and give the rest to me later.” Tang Xiu took out a number of Immortal Crystals and handed them to the four people. Then, he shifted his attention to the mortal combat in the prison cell.</p><p>The four men looked at each other first before taking the Immortal Crystals given to them by Tang Xiu and then left the cell area.</p><p>As he watched the fight in the cell, Tang Xiu shifted to Qin Yu with great interest and lightly smiled. “Do you perhaps want to gamble?”</p><p>“Pardon?” Qin Yu froze for a moment before a bewildered look appeared on her beautiful face.</p><p>“Well, there are two fighters fighting in the cell now. Whoever you choose as the winner, I’ll pick the other one. I’ll give you some Immortal Stones if you win, and you give me some if you lose. How about it?”</p><p>Qin Yu slightly frowned, but she hesitated and then shook her head. “I apologize, Sir. I just can’t afford to lose.”</p><p>Tang Xiu was astonished and asked, “You’re working in Convict Arena, so you surely receive tips from the guests. You should at least have some Immortal Stones in possession, no? Yet you said you can’t afford to gamble?”</p><p>“I-I can’t afford to gamble. I… I owe a high-interest rate loan. Every Immortal Stone is very important to me,” Qin Yu replied bitterly.</p><p>Tang Xiu shot her a strange expression. He observed that this lass was quite frail and had a docile temperament. Yet she unexpectedly had a high-interest loan?</p><p>One truly can’t judge a book from its cover…</p><p>Tang Xiu secretly sighed inwardly and stopped mentioning gambling.</p><p>After 2 hours, the next fight in the cell began. Tang Xiu watched the performance and specific information of the two fighters the moment they entered the arena to analyze which one of them would win.</p><p>“Go place 1 million Immortal Crystals on the win of that Blazing Flame Celestial Immortal.”</p><p>Tang Xiu handed Battle Peng a temporarily used interspatial ring and ordered calmly.</p><p>Battle Peng hesitated for a while and then spoke in a low voice, “Master, the other four have left, but if I leave, there’s nobody else next to…”</p><p>Tang Xiu waved and said, “Take it easy, will you? Nobody can kill me unless the assassin is a Perfected Golden Immortal.”</p><p>Battle Peng had no idea where Tang Xiu’s confidence came from. However, he was just a subordinate, so he could only take the order and quickly rushed towards the exchange desk as per Tang Xiu’s instructions. His speed was very fast and, after taking the gambling deeds from the cashier, he quickly returned to Tang Xiu and resumed his protection duty.</p><p>Several meters away from their position.</p><p>A white-attired young man dressed like a weak scholar turned to Tang Xiu with a surprised expression. After ruminating for a short while, he shook his head and said, “Immortal Friend, Blazing Flame Celestial Immortal is just a mid-stage Celestial Immortal, whereas Freshwater Celestial Immortal is a late-stage one. Besides, water can subdue fire, so Freshwater has two means that definitely can suppress Blazing Flame. Why did you still place such a big bet on him? Is it for the 3 to 1 odds?”</p><p>Tang Xiu turned to look at the young man. After observing his appearance, he found that the fellow had no malicious or wicked tendencies, while his cultivation should be at the Profound Immortal Stage. Therefore, he replied to him with a smile, “Just like a horse won’t get fat if it doesn’t eat grass at night, no windfall will come to a poor man. This is just an unconventional gambit of mine. Daring to take a big risk and be ready for the big return. Everyone may think that Freshwater Celestial Immortal can win, but I beg to differ. That Blazing Flame Celestial Immortal will surely end up the winner.”</p><p><em>Unconventional gambit? Just like the horse won’t get fat if it doesn’t eat grass at night, a man won’t get a windfall if he’s not rich himself?</em></p><p>The eyes of the young man in white lit up as he savored these two lines carefully. The more he thought about it, the more he felt how reasonable it was. After deeply looking at Tang Xiu for a while, he slightly nodded and then turned around to speak to the two companions around him, “I’m going to place my bet on Blazing Flame’s victory!”</p><p>“Are you crazy?”</p><p>“Are you sick in the head or something? Just because you heard that brat’s bull you’re gonna place your bet on that Blazing Flame guy?”</p><p>The other two youths were in disbelief and blurted out their objection one after another.</p><p>The young man in white took a deep breath and firmly said, “Say no more. It’s not because anything else, but I do approve those two lines he said. I already made up my mind to place my bet on Blazing Flame. No worries. I won’t play big, so I won’t be devastated even if I lose.”</p><p>One of the youths asked, “How much are you gonna bet, exactly?”</p><p>The young man in white answered, “1 million Immortal Crystals.”</p><p>Gasp…</p><p>The two youths gasped coldly the moment they heard it. All three of them were friends who grew up and cultivated together since childhood and knew each other inside out. They belonged to the same sect and were well aware of how much wealth each possessed. These 1 million Immortal Crystals were probably one-fifth of their companion’s wealth.</p><p>“Haih, have it your will. You already made up your mind and I know it’s useless to persuade you. Straight and narrow as it may, I’ll place my bet on Freshwater’s victory. Only in this way can I make a steady profit without losing money.”</p><p>“I’m placing mine on Freshwater’s victory too.”</p><p>The other two guys pondered for a while and said one after another.</p><p>The young man in white turned to Tang Xiu and realized that Tang Xiu gave him an appreciative look, causing him to suddenly feel at ease. In fact, he also had such intention in this gambling. He would lose a fifth of his wealth if he lost but earn three-fifths more if he won.</p><p>Inside the arena cell.</p><p>A flame of anger blazed in Blazing Flame Celestial Immortal’s heart. His eyes full of killing intent locked on his opponent, Freshwater Celestial Immortal, who shot him a contemptuous look. Blazing Flame had a record of 107 matches won in the Convict Arena. Except for the two matches that ended with his opponents injured, he slaughtered all the opponents he faced from the other 105 matches.</p><p>But this time, he was keenly aware that someone in the Convict Arena management just wanted him to die. Else, he wouldn’t have been arranged to fight against Freshwater Celestial Immortal in this match. After all, people with keen eyes could see that Freshwater had a higher cultivation than him and definitely had some immortal arts that could suppress him.</p><p>Is it finally time to use that move?</p><p>Blazing Flame Celestial Immortal was unwilling, but he had no other choice but to use it for the sake of surviving.</p><p>Freshwater Celestial Immortal stared contemptuously at Blazing Flame Celestial Immortal, hooked his finger, and smilingly said, “I won’t bully you, so I’m giving you a 3-move handicap. If you can’t beat me within 3 moves, then you’re as good as dead!”</p><p>3 moves?</p><p>Blazing Flame’s ferocious instinct was set ablaze. His stance suddenly changed and his body flickered, causing 8 figures to simultaneously appear with each shrouded in blazing flames. Then, continuously moving, they quickly surrounded Freshwater Celestial Immortal from eight directions and mounted a fierce attack.</p><p>“Same old trick, huh? You really made no progress.”</p><p>Freshwater Celestial Immortal had long studied Blazing Flame’s records and watched his fighting style. Finding that the guy still resorted to the same old style to deal with him, he was filled with disdain and contempt. He quickly unleashed a bluish immortal sword that instantly turned into a layered water shield made of sword light and warded off the strikes from those eight figures.</p><p>“Infinite destruction!”</p><p>Blazing Flame roared inwardly. His eight figures suddenly shattered, giving birth to blazing flames everywhere in the sky. A fireball of tens of meters in diameter appeared out of nowhere in the sea of fire, while a flaming lance hidden in the fireball bombarded towards Freshwater Celestial Immortal.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
