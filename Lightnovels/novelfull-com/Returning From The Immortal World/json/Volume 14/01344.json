Her eyes glanced at Tang Xiu’s handsome face first but didn’t stay long as she shifted to the other Perfected Golden Immortals around him.</p><p><em>All of them are unfamiliar faces?</em></p><p>Apotheosis Bella slightly pursed her brows and led the four Perfected Golden Immortals a kilometer away from Tang Xiu’s group before her pace immediately came to a halt.</p><p>Tang Xiu sighed inwardly and said in a deep voice, “The rest of you except Dao Lord Green Firmament enter the Heavenly Abode!”</p><p>“At your words, Lord!”</p><p>The crowd cupped their fists and entered the Heavenly Abode artifact one after another. Star Tears, however, glanced at Apotheosis Bella with a strange expression before she left, her heart was filled with unclear feelings.</p><p>Tang Xiu looked at Apotheosis Bella and motioned her. Right as her expression drastically changed, he sighed. “It’s been hard on you all these years.”</p><p>Apotheosis Bella’s eyes fixedly stared at Tang Xiu’s facial features. She could see the familiarity in his eyes very easily—the eyes she used to look at and long for countless times either in days and nights.</p><p>“You guys stay here and wait for me.”</p><p>Apotheosis Bella looked to the side and issued an order before she flew towards Tang Xiu. When she came in front of him, she cast a concealment array and pulled Tang Xiu’s wrist as they entered it.</p><p>“Are you really… you?”</p><p>Lips squirming, crystal tears emerged in Apotheosis Bella’s eyes.</p><p>Tang Xiu nodded without a word. He could feel the turbulent emotions flooded inside her. He sighed again inwardly and said bitterly, “Everything happened and changed so fast in the past, whoever thought that we could meet again in such a situation in this place? Thank you, Bella. But still, I need to say that I’m really sorry to you again.”</p><p>The teardrops in Apotheosis Bella’s eyes flowed even though she tried her best to suppress her emotions. She rushed into Tang Xiu’s embrace and hugged him tightly. She had pangs of doubts before, but now she was 100% sure that the man in front of her was Tang Xiu—the man she had fallen in love with for thousands of years.</p><p>His smell was still so familiar to her.</p><p>“I missed you.”</p><p>Her Immortal body shivered ever so violently and her tears quickly wet Tang Xiu’s shoulders. Endless thoughts and lovesickness turned into tears as though venting all the grievances she had been enduring all these years.</p><p>Tang Xiu’s body went stiff before he finally raised his hand gently and softly patted her back, giving her comfort through his action.</p><p>After a long while, Apotheosis Bella stopped crying and looked at Tang Xiu’s face with teary eyes. Carefully holding this strange yet familiar face, she muttered, “Back in the past, I’ve been dreaming of this scene so many times that I even woke up crying countless times. Xiu, I really miss you so much.”</p><p>“…”</p><p>Tang Xiu couldn’t utter any words. He didn’t know what kind of response he should give her. Despite some things he had learned about Apotheosis Bella, she had really paid too much for him.</p><p>She had gone through fire and wither, risking her life to protect the people he once cared about. Her family and friends died in the battles one after another, just because of her true feelings for him. Yet, she still insisted and persevered even though she faced death countless times.</p><p>Tang Xiu was now perfectly aware that since then, there was still one more person he cared about in this world—a woman he would never want to see wronged.</p><p>After a long while, tears still trailed down Apotheosis Bella’s cheek, but a smile now painted her face as she said softly, “I’ve not touched your cheek ever since you met her. I also never hugged you ever since you got together with her. You know what? Those days when we entered the Dao and got along together were the happiest of my life.”</p><p>“I’m really sorry.” Tang Xiu was filled with guilt.</p><p>Apotheosis Bella gently raised her hand to shut Tang Xiu’s lips and shook her head and continued with a gentle voice, “Please don’t apologize to me. That’s a word I never want to hear. Xiu, I’m now very happy because I already know that you’ve repented and straightened yourself out.”</p><p><em>I’ve repented and straightened out myself?</em> Tang Xiu was puzzled and asked, “What do you mean?”</p><p>Apotheosis Bella smiled. “Mu told me before that you have more than one woman now.”</p><p>Tang Xiu froze for a moment as a touch of awkwardness and embarrassment appeared on his face. He forced a smile and said, “I was not a native of the Immortal World, originally. I returned to the place I belong to after Great Emperor Danqing, Zither Demon Jiuyao, and she ambushed me. I have parents, relatives, and friends in that place. But then again, I really have to thank them since I wouldn’t have been able to eliminate my mental demon without them.”</p><p>“So… it turns out that you…” Apotheosis Bella was surprised.</p><p>“A wisp of my soul flew away and went to the Immortal World back then and I eventually became the young Lord of the Vermillion Bird Holy Sect. Those people there are also my parents and relatives, but I still also have my blood parents and family members in another world.”</p><p>Apotheosis Bella understood in a flash and she said, “I don’t care who you are. I just need to know that I, Bella Fern Regalia, am your woman from now on. Back in the past, I had some scruples since you were with her—the reason why I tried everything to make you accept me. My obsession still exists even though she’s gone now.”</p><p>“You…”</p><p>Tang Xiu’s lips wriggled, but Apotheosis Bella raised her hand to stop him from speaking.</p><p>Deeply staring at Tang Xiu, Apotheosis Bella continued and emphasized every word she said. “There has been only one man that Bella has ever recognized in life. I don’t care how many women you have. As long as you have me in your heart, your affection and love, that’s enough for me. Unless you want me to grow old in loneliness until my last breath and my soul is gone—a woman who couldn’t love anyone and has no one to love her back.”</p><p>Tang Xiu gently grasped her wrist and said, “Why do you still choose to be like this, Bella?”</p><p>“I love you, so I choose and am willing to do so. That’s what my heart wants me to do,” replied Bella Fern Regalia with all seriousness.</p><p>Tang Xiu took a deep breath and said, “I have wronged you and troubled you too much. I’m the one who’s at fault here. But if you don’t shut me out, then I want to take you with me.”</p><p>“I accept!”</p><p>Apotheosis Bella burst into tears and hugged Tang Xiu again.</p><p>Suddenly, her expression slightly changed and quickly stopped her tears and converged her aura. She then lowered her voice and said, “I sense a powerhouse’s aura. That person should be a Supreme!”</p><p>A glimmer of light flashed in Tang Xiu’s eyes and he said in a deep voice, “If my guess is right, that person should be Myriad Thunder Supreme. Before you came here, my retainer killed Styx River Venerable, his disciple. And I made another disciple of his, Dao Lord Green Firmament, as my slave. Myriad Thunder Supreme must be here due to the death of his disciple.”</p><p>Apotheosis Bella’s eyes were full of murderous intent as she replied in a deep voice, “Then let’s make him stay here for good since he’s already here!”</p><p>Tang Xiu nodded and said, “Quickly change your appearance and the aura of your qi. I’ve investigated clearly, the only Supremacy Stage powerhouse here is Myriad Thunder Supreme. He’s assisted by 6 Perfected Golden Immortals, one of whom has died and another one whose life is controlled by me now. We have a Supreme and 4 Perfected Golden Immortals to face now.”</p><p>“Anyway, I just saw that you have quite a lot of Perfected Golden Immortals around you.” Apotheosis Bella suddenly asked, “Who are they?”</p><p>“I bought all of them from the Convict Arena, including Auntie Star Tears,” said Tang Xiu. “However, I have yet to tell her my real identity, so I cannot tell anyone except you and Mu. Else, we’ll have to face endless pursuit once Great Emperor Danqing and Zither Demon Jiuyao find out about it.”</p><p>“Mu has already told me about this issue as well.” Apotheosis Bella nodded and said, “Rest assured! Nobody will ever know it from me.”</p><p>Tang Xiu nodded in response and pulled her out of the concealment array to then appear beside her four Perfected Golden Immortal subordinates.</p><p>“What happened here, Green Firmament? The Life Token of your Senior Brother Styx River shattered, meaning his soul has vanished. Explain it to me!” Myriad Thunder Supreme was alone, but a fierce light flashed in his eyes as he inquisitively asked with a heavy voice.</p><p>Dao Lord Green Firmament couldn’t help but panic inside, yet he didn’t dare to tell the truth even when facing his Master, Myriad Thunder Supreme. No matter how much he respected his Master, his life was, after all, being controlled by Tang Xiu. He didn’t want to die and he was even willing to take any action in killing his own Master.</p><p>“Master, Senior Brother Styx River just ran into a strong enemy who seems to be called Sablefiend Scorpio. That person is fearsomely strong and only a hair away from the Supremacy Stage. Further, that person also has a very fearsome artifact in hand. When I arrived here, Senior Brother Styx River was already dying and I was too late to rescue him when he was killed by Sablefiend Scorpio,” explained Dao Lord Green Firmament hurriedly.</p><p>“Sablefiend Scorpio?!”</p><p>A strong murderous intent burst out from Myriad Thunder Supreme. He knew that there was a blood feud between his disciple and Sablefiend Scorpio. If it hadn’t been for Sablefiend Scorpio escaping too fast, he would have helped his disciple get rid of this hidden danger. He then looked at the pale-looking Dao Lord Green Firmament and asked in a deep voice, “Then where did that damn scorpion go? And why did she let you off?”</p><p>Dao Lord Green Firmament hurriedly replied, “Sablefiend Scorpio seemed to have been hit hard as well after she killed Senior Brother, Master. I wanted to avenge Senior Brother Styx River, but she didn’t want to get entangled by me and just fled away directly. Her speed was too fast for me to catch up, so I could only send messages to some Martial Brothers to help me pursue her together.”</p><p>“Is that so?”</p><p>A cold light flashed in Myriad Thunder Supreme’s eyes. His big hand quickly moved and slapped Dao Lord Green Firmament, sending him flying for hundreds of kilometers. Then, he grimly and coldly said, “You may be my disciple, but you should be very clear what your fate will be for deceiving me!”</p><p>Dao Lord Green Firmament flew back again and replied in pain, “Everything this disciple of yours just said is true, Master. I mentioned in the messages I sent to Martial Brother that there’s a Perfected Golden Immortal with a powerful artifact. It was because I needed his help and I worried that he wouldn’t come, so I lied in the message I sent him. If you don’t believe me, I can take you to the direction Sablefiend Scorpio escaped.”</p><p>“Heh, pursuing her?” Myriad Thunder Supreme sneered. “It’s been so long. Which direction are we going to chase her? Do you even know where she fled to?”</p><p>“I know, Master,” said Dao Lord Green Firmament hurriedly. “I’ve secretly poured Soul Chasing powder on her previously.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
