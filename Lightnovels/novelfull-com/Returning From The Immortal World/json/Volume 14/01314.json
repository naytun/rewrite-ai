It burst into laughter and excitedly said, “What? I  turn out to be comparable to a Golden Immortal expert? That’s great.  Awesome. No worries, Master. I just devoured your Immortal Crystals, but  I’ll repay it ten million times in the future.”</p><p>Having said that, it lightly circled around and smilingly said, “What  do you think, Master? Do I look handsome and cool? Well, the humans on  your Earth are kind of interesting. I miss the days when I followed you  on Earth, Master.”</p><p>Tang Xiu looked at him with a smile and said, “Then how about I send you back to Earth?”</p><p>“Uh… don’t mind me that thought, Master.” Star Devourer Insect smiled  and said, “Well, although there are many interesting things on Earth, I  still prefer it here, though. God! This place has great food, Immortal  Crystals, rich Immortal Force, and those intoxicating various mineral  deposits are just awesome. Besides, there’s my favorite Master living  here, no?”</p><p>“Bah, what an ass-kisser.” Tang Xiu couldn’t help but roll his eyes.  Suddenly, he was hit by a bad feeling after seeing the flattering  expression on this guy’s face. He watched it cautiously and asked, “I’ve  provided you with tons of Immortal Crystals, so what are you gonna do  now? You also know how vast the Chinese culture is, so you must know the  saying among the Chinese to not be greedy and enough is enough,  capiche?”</p><p>“Master, you humans need to eat too, right?” asked Star Devourer Insect.</p><p>“One doesn’t need to eat if his cultivation grows strong enough,” answered Tang Xiu.</p><p>“But I’m still young, Master.” Star Devourer Insect felt being wronged and retorted.</p><p>Tang Xiu was really defeated by this fella. This guy had strength  comparable to a Golden Immortal, yet he said he was still young? How  could this sonuvabitch whose age only God knew many times older than him  still got a set skill to act young like this? How come he failed to  notice this bastard’s essence before?</p><p>“Just blow your fart out quickly if you got something to say. But I  gotta remind you first. I have a great family here and everyone in the  Great Tang Empire needs me to feed them, so if you still want Immortal  Crystals, I’m really sorry.”</p><p>“I want no more Immortal Crystals.” Star Devourer Insect said, “You  just need to provide ores, metals, or any materials. As long as it’s not  garbage, they can become my nourishment. I can also extract their  essences. Master, don’t you want to have a super Star Devourer Insect as  your bodyguard? Uh, no, just let me be your thug, kay? I’ll definitely  devour anyone you don’t like, promise!”</p><p>Tang Xiu shot a weird look at it and asked, “It wasn’t only your  strength that improved, was it? It seems your brain evolved too.”</p><p>“It was you who took me into your body, Master.” Star Devourer Insect  smilingly said, “I experienced what you’ve been through as well, so, of  course, my IQ has to be improved, else I’d be so sorry for your  reward.”</p><p>“NO SHEETS!”</p><p>Tang Xiu recalled all the adult things he did with his women and  suddenly couldn’t help but swear. But when he thought about, Does this  bastard even care about it? This shitty thing surely knows fart about  things between men and women.</p><p>“Alright, I’ll provide them to you later.”</p><p>Tang Xiu promised and put it back into his body directly. When he  left Heavenly Abode artifact and appeared in front of Gu Yan’er, he  smilingly said, “Well, we got another Golden Immortal thug now, so you  can rest assured! No danger will come to me later.”</p><p>“The Star Devourer Insect actually broke through to the Golden Immortal Stage? Its cultivation speed is really very fast.”</p><p>“If my guess is correct, more than 35,000 monsters will soon be able  to advance to the Golden Immortal Stage too. After all, they’ve lived  for too long and their continuous accumulation will make their strength  progress by leaps and bounds after they get the immortal cultivation  arts. Let’s wait and see! It won’t be long before our Great Tang Empire  will have tens of thousands of Golden Immortals.”</p><p>Gu Yan’er smilingly nodded in response. But shortly after, her  expression slightly changed, realizing that although she could still  hold her position as the strongest in the Great Tang Empire now, a large  number of Golden Immortals would appear the more time passed. Her  position was in jeopardy!</p><p>I gotta breakthrough! I have to advance to the Perfected Golden  Immortal in the shortest time possible! As long as I can return to being  a Perfected Golden Immortal, I can still maintain my position as the  strongest in the Great Tang Empire.</p><p>Green Summit Bazaar.</p><p>In a block of a remote area of Moongazing City was a not so high  building with an ordinary environment. But everyone who lived in  Moongazing City knew that it was a chaotic place. People from all walks  of life everywhere gathered here, while brothels and gambling  establishments could be found here and there. It was in such a chaotic  place that a huge black market gradually established.</p><p>This black market had many things that were not available elsewhere  in Moongazing City. For instance, many wicked things. Even things from  the Demon, Devil, and Ashura Realms could be found here. Shortly put,  anyone could find anything they wanted in this place as long as they had  tons of Immortal Stones, Crystals, or Crystal Essences in their  interspatial rings.</p><p>Tang Xiu took Tang Ahlang, Battle Peng, and several other Golden  Immortals and dressed as ordinary cultivators as they blended in the  Green Summit Bazaar. Tang Xiu’s main purpose in coming here was to  purchase resources for his cultivation art, the Heavenly Art of Cosmic  Genesis, so the first time he did as a stranger was to find himself a  guide.</p><p>Festoon Dragonfly.</p><p>The man was just a small-time gangster, the lowest of its kind in the  Green Summit Bazaar. He was one who talked like humans to humans, acted  like a ghost when he bumped into ghosts and kept changing roles  according to the situation. In short, he lived a good life relying on  his shrewdness.</p><p>Being a guide was one of his identities, and he used it to earn extra  money. However, he had been here for centuries and never once met a  real loaded person nor received too big a reward.</p><p>At the door of a Spirit Beast shop, Festoon Dragonfly leaned on the  door of the shop with all kinds of boredom filling him. His eyes  casually glanced around through the crowd. But suddenly, his expression  shifted and his eyes locked on a group of nine people passing by not far  away.</p><p>He possessed a special ability which only he knew about. That special  ability allowed him to sense the aura of others. Even though the other  party had all their auras restrained, he could still sense it, allowing  him to be able to judge their cultivation level.</p><p>An ordinary Immortal with an ordinary cultivator, yet they are  followed by 7 Golden Immortal experts? These guys are definitely not  natives of Green Summit Bazaar since I have never seen them. Seeing  their appearances, they definitely came here to buy something. Maybe  because they’re not familiar with this place, so they’re just looking  blindly.</p><p>After the fella made the inference, he immediately greeted the nine  people with a full smiling face. While blocking Tang Xiu’s way, he  nodded at him and smilingly said, “Do you perhaps need a guide, Sire?  This little one is called Festoon Dragonfly—a walking booklet of Green  Summit Bazaar you can inquire about. Whether you’d like to buy some  special things or is in need of something here, just tell me. This  little one guarantees that he can take you to the best place to buy  whatever you’d like to purchase.”</p><p>“State your price,” said Tang Xiu.</p><p>Festoon Dragonfly was immediately excited upon hearing it and  smilingly replied, “Sir, you just got yourself the best guide here, so  the price for my service will be much more expensive. 2 Immortal Stones a  day. Of course, I charge more than others for several reasons. Firstly,  I can help you bargain when you buy something and I promise you that I  can expose those who dare to try to scam you. Additionally, I guarantee  to not take some secret bonuses. You know what I’m saying, right?”</p><p>“I know.” Tang Xiu nodded in response. The said “bonus” was for the  guides who took potential patrons to the stores they were familiar with.  After the patrons bought something, they would get a commission from  the stores.</p><p>Tang Xiu then shifted to Festoon Dragonfly and smilingly said, “You  got quite an interesting name, and your self-recommendation is rather  effective too. I did come here to buy some things. I’ll give you 2  Immortal Crystals if you can serve me well.”</p><p>“No worries, Sire. I promise you the best serv…”</p><p>All of a sudden, his words came to an abrupt halt as disbelief  covered his pretty face. He blinked and stutteringly asked, “You… what  did you just say? You’ll give me 2 Immortal Crystals every day and not  Immortal Stones?”</p><p>“You heard it right,” Tang Xiu said with a smile. “Complete the task  excellently and not only will I give 2 Immortal Crystals every day, but  also lots of rewards after I’m done with all my purchases. But the  number of rewards will depend on your ability in the process.”</p><p>Festoon Dragonfly looked ecstatic. He nodded repeatedly and bowed.  “No worries, Sire. This one swears to Heaven that you’ll get the best  service this one can provide. For the next days, you’ll become my Heaven  and Earth, my parent, my benefactor. You can tell me any kind of items  you’d like to buy and I’ll take you there right away.”</p><p>“So, you should know a place that sells Demon Stones, then?” asked Tang Xiu.</p><p>Festoon Dragonfly was stunned before he nodded and replied, “I know  the things sold in the Dark Court. Most of them are items from the Demon  Realm. Further, the Dark Court itself is also the shop with the most  Demon Stones in the Green Summit Bazaar.”</p><p>“Lead the way, then.” Tang Xiu nodded.</p><p>The Dark Court was deep in the Green Summit Bazaar and extended far  to one side. When everyone arrived, Tang Xiu discovered that the Dark  Court itself was a high-grade artifact. Aside from its defensive effect,  it had no offensive feature, so it was used as a shop.</p><p>As everyone entered the Dark Court, they found many booths and  independent shops inside where every one of them was hosted by people  who sold items from the Demon Realm.</p><p>“Are you here to buy or sell?”</p><p>Two majestic men dressed in black armor greeted them. Their eyes shot  a scrutinizing look at the group, and the question came from the man on  the left.</p><p>“Buy,” Tang Xiu answered.</p><p>The man on the left nodded and said, “1 Immortal Stone per person as an entry fee.”</p><p>Tang Xiu took out 10 Immortal Stones and handed them to the other  party as he watched them leave. Then, he looked around at the stalls and  independent shops inside. Festoon Dragonfly was obviously a regular of  the place since he merrily joked and greeted many stalls and shop  owners.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
