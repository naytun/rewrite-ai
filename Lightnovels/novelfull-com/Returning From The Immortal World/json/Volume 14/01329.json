The place was the Misty Spring Ocean. Even a Perfected Golden Immortal would face a limited range of vision in this place. As of now, tens of Immortals in black robes and holding immortal swords were casting their eyes on them.</p><p>“I want to see Apotheon Mu.”</p><p>Tang Xiu came to the tens of Immortals and indifferently said.</p><p>A burly Golden Immortal frowned and coldly replied, “Who are you, Sir? Is the name of our Lord something you can call out directly like that?”</p><p>“If I’m not qualified to call his name, then there’s likely no one else in the entire Immortal World who is qualified to do so,” said Tang Xiu lightly. “Send a message to Apotheon Mu and tell him that an old friend came to visit him. Tell him that this friend wants to occupy the Misty Spring Ocean as his territory.”</p><p>Brush…</p><p>In that instant, the tens of Immortal soldiers, including the burly man raised their respective immortal swords and glared at Tang Xiu with hostility.</p><p>“Think clearly. You’ll definitely face capital punishment if you offend me. Further, you won’t lose anything by doing what I just told you. You may even get a huge reward later,” said Tang Xiu.</p><p>The burly man stared at Tang Xiu coldly for a long while and finally turned his attention to Gu Yan’er and Battle Peng. He could clearly sense that both of them had very powerful auras, way stronger than his.</p><p>“Please wait.”</p><p>The burly man pondered inwardly for a moment and finally transmitted a message through the Message Token.</p><p>****</p><p>At the edge of Hoary Head Galaxy.</p><p>A fight was currently underway where 8 Perfected Golden Immortals besieged Apotheosis Immortal Mu. If it wasn’t for the Luminous Nacre Fan in his hands that was able to unleash fearsome killing blows, Apotheon Mu would have long been killed by them.</p><p>Yet, despite still being able to protect himself, he was still badly scarred and under imminent danger at the moment.</p><p>Suddenly, his complexion suddenly changed and he unleashed the strongest blow he could execute with the Luminous Nacre Fan. Stream of lights burst out from him and flew beyond 10,000 meters in a flash, as a line of golden writing appeared in his field of vision: Lord Apotheosis Immortal Mu, some people claiming to be your old friends said they wanted to occupy your territory. They are now outside the teleportation array.</p><p>Some old friends wanting to take over the territory?</p><p>Apotheon Mu felt bitter inwardly. In such a dangerous predicament, he had no time to make a clone of himself. What vexed him more was that some powerful enemies had appeared in his Misty Spring Island. Looking at the 8 Perfected Golden Immortals who lunged at him once again, he gritted his teeth and shouted, “Come! Even if I die, I’ll drag you to hell with me!”</p><p>Just as his voice faded away, he pinched the Message Token and quickly disappeared into the distant sky.</p><p>****</p><p>Outside the teleportation array on Misty Spring Island.</p><p>The burly man’s expression shifted when he grabbed the flickering streamer in his hand. He immediately read the message contained inside and, after reading it, he looked at Tang Xiu and said, “His Lordship Mu has transmitted a message and left an Immortal Mark. Please go there to see him personally!”</p><p>Tang Xiu glanced at the Immortal Mark bursting out of the Message Token and immediately asked in a deep voice, “How long does it take from here to Apotheon Mu’s position?”</p><p>“It should take 4 hours with the full speed of a Golden Immortal.” The burly man sneered.</p><p>Tang Xiu nodded and then summoned Seaway Monarch from the Heavenly Abode artifact. Then he spoke indifferently, “Lead the way. Take us to where the Immortal Mark is located.”</p><p>“Understood!” Seaway Monarch replied and instantly wrapped Tang Xiu’s group of three and bolted towards the place marked by the Immortal Mark. His speed was very fast; it only took him a blink of an eye to traverse and appear thousands of miles away.</p><p>“So fast?!!”</p><p>The burly man’s complexion changed dramatically and his face was full of shock. He could see that the summoned big man was at least a Perfected Golden Immortal.</p><p>****</p><p>At the edge of Misty Spring Island.</p><p>Counter-attacking with the intention of perishing together with his enemies, Apotheon Mu was still able to defend himself. Even though the 8 Perfected Golden Immortals went all out, they didn’t want to perish together and kept attacking while defending themselves, in an attempt to finally kill Apotheon Mu.</p><p>“Hehehe, we’ve been keeping tabs on the Immortal Lyceum, but I didn’t expect to find your trace there, Apotheon Mu. Master has told us that you’re to be executed directly the moment we find you. Therefore, you must die today so you can get the reward from our Master. If you’re willing to commit suicide, we promise to leave a wisp of your soul so you can reincarnate. Else you can expect your soul to scatter to oblivion.” A yellow-robed old man with long, scarlet hair gleefully spoke.</p><p>“Hmph, my Master said that enemies must be shredded to pieces and dye their clothes with their blood even if we must perish together. Speak no more nonsense, will you? I still have the Luminous Nacre Fan artifact, so I’ll take the souls of some of you down with me to oblivion. It’s still worth it taking several dogs of Zither Demon Jiuyao to be buried together,” retorted Apotheon Mu coldly.</p><p>The smile on the yellow-robed old man’s face elapsed and he coldly said, “You want to vanish to oblivion that much, huh? Then we’ll fulfill your wish! Just wait until you spend all your Immortal Force and your blood is drained out of your body. Let’s see if you still can take us to the grave with you.”</p><p>Apotheon Mu knew well the intention of the other party. Based on their method, he really had no means to take them with him to the grave. It was even harder to inflict significant damage to them.</p><p>Yet, he wasn’t content. He was unwilling—because he had yet to rescue his four Martial Brothers from the Heavenly Mountain. He hadn’t helped Apotheon Immortal Bella find a Holy Dragon Fruit, either. More so that he had yet to see the souls of those treacherous, abominable bastards perish.</p><p>Hundreds of thousands of miles away.</p><p>Seaway Monarch suddenly stopped mid-air and looked at the direction of Apotheon Mu’s fighting with the other eight, saying, “Master, I can sense a fight between Perfected Golden Immortals over there. They should be early-stage Perfected Golden Immortals, but one of them is holding a very powerful immortal artifact that even I must be very cautious towards.”</p><p>Tang Xiu’s expression changed and he asked in a deep voice, “How many Perfected Golden Immortals are there?”</p><p>“A total of 9 people from both sides,” answered Seaway Monarch.</p><p>Tang Xiu took a deep breath and said in a deep voice, “Hurry up and immediately catch up. But don’t take any rash action and listen to my orders.”</p><p>Seaway Monarch hesitated for a moment, but he still flew towards the position with three people in tow.</p><p>The moment the four of them approached, the yellow-robed old man’s expression abruptly changed and he shouted aloud, “We’re 8 Generals under Zither Demon Jiuyao. Quickly scram if you have no business here!”</p><p>At the moment, Tang Xiu clearly saw the fight where Apotheon Mu was besieged by the 8 Perfected Golden Immortals. Crazy killing intent overflowed in his eyes when he saw that Apotheon was in grave danger. However, he was perfectly aware of his own strength. Unless he could break through to the Profound Immortal Stage, there was no way he would be able to contend with any Perfected Golden Immortal powerhouses.</p><p>“Come out!”</p><p>Hideously grinning, Tang Xiu instantly summoned 22 high-level immortals instantly. Among these 22 people, 20 of them were late-stage Golden Immortals and 2 others, Stas Tears and Zenith Venerable, were Perfected Golden Immortals. Tang Xiu took a deep breath and fiercely said, “Hmph, that asshole Zither Demon Jiuyao truly has a notorious reputation. I’m sure the 8 Generals under him are as abominable as him. I didn’t plan to poke my nose, but there are so many people bullying one person, this is so damn despicable! KILL THEM!”</p><p>The 20-plus people exchanged dismayed glances and looked hesitant. But after seeing the killing intent in Tang Xiu’s eyes, they immediately smiled bitterly and lunged towards the 8 Perfected Golden Immortals.</p><p>Apotheon Mu was caught off guard with the sudden change. He originally thought that these people were also enemies, so he didn’t expect that they turned out to come to help him.</p><p>There were 3 more Perfected Golden Immortals and 20 late-stage Golden Immortals. Adding himself, even if they weren’t able to decimate all the 8 powerful enemies, they were likely able to make them suffer greatly.</p><p>Tang Xiu took a deep breath and said in a deep voice, “Apotheon Immortal Mu, I’ve long heard your name. You’re the disciple of Star Cultivation Great Emperor who, for some reason, has been roaming all over the world and regards everywhere as his home. Later on, he occupied a territory somewhere to live a reclusive life. Is that right?”</p><p>The coming of helpers sharply eased the pressure on Apotheon Mu. After hearing Tang Xiu’s words, he flew up, fiercely attacked the enemies, and then replied in a deep voice, “You’re right, Sir.”</p><p>“You’re in a grave situation now and the territory you once occupied may become a land without an owner if you die. So how about I save your life and you give me your territory?” said Tang Xiu aloud.</p><p>“If you can help me kill them, then my territory is yours to take in the future!” Apotheon Mu replied with a deep voice.</p><p>Tang Xiu slightly nodded. His figure then flickered to appear inside the Heavenly Abode artifact. He quickly found Tang An and said in a deep voice, “There’s a mission for you.”</p><p>“Please instruct me,” said Tang An solemnly.</p><p>Tang Xiu took out an interspatial ring and handed it to her, saying, “There are Dragons Imbroglio Array disks here—some precious treasures I bought at a high price. Even a Perfected Golden Immortal will be stranded inside for some time. We got an intense battle outside now and most of the combatants are Perfected Golden Immortals. Therefore, I need you to go into hiding in the dark and secretly plant the Dragons Imbroglio Array disk around them.”</p><p>“No problem.” Tang An took the ring and firmly nodded. “I’ll go out immediately.”</p><p>Tang Xiu to stop her and seriously said, “Tang An, you need to be extra careful. Once you find that the situation is going wrong, immediately abandon the formation. When you’re outside, Battle Peng will wander around the battlefield and you must hide under his cover all the time. Additionally, the scope of the arrangement of the array must at least be 100,000 kilometers away from the battle scene of those powerhouses.”</p><p>“100,000 kilometers radius?!” Tang An couldn’t help but exclaim in shock.</p><p>“That’s why Battle Peng will protect you while you move without traces so as to block the impact from the battle caused by the fighting of those powerhouses. Tell me, can you do it?”</p><p>“Definitely!” Tang An secretly gritted her teeth.</p><p>Tang Xiu took a deep breath and once again took out a white immortal armor from his interspatial ring. Then, he said in a deep voice, “I give you a few minutes to refine this. This is the Celestial Silkworm Armor, it can protect you from the full blow of a Perfected Golden Immortal without dying. But remember that you can only ward off such a blow once as this Celestial Silkworm Armor will disintegrate the moment after.”</p><p>Tang An’s eyes looked at it softly and she nodded without saying a word. After refining the Celestial Silkworm Armor and putting it behind her tabard, she silently disappeared and went outside the Heavenly Abode artifact.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
