He regarded the reputation of his clan and himself more important than his own life. Even though he committed many despicable deeds, those were done in secret and he always tried his best to erase all the traces as early as possible.</p><p>However, he overheard the passers-by below all discrediting and smearing him. Not only did they say that he was shameful and insidious, but they also said that he was… homosexual and had male pets in private.</p><p>“F*ck these punks!”</p><p>Scarless Hunter clenched his fists, eyes filled with madness and killing intent as he watched those four passersby’s limbs discarded like dead dogs. He got up and came to the man who just smeared him. Grabbing his mantle, he fiercely shouted, “This God is that Scarless Hunter, the young Lord of Hunter Clan. What kind of enmity did we ever have that would even make you throw such dirt on my face and ruin my reputation?”</p><p>The man whose limbs were discarded stared fearfully. He shook his head desperately and said, “No, no, this lowly has no qualification to contract any enmity with young Lord Hunter! It all comes from the rumors flying everywhere in Green Summit Bazaar. Everything I talked about I heard from others!”</p><p>“Come again?!”</p><p>Scarless Hunter was paralyzed. Even in his wildest dream he never once thought that someone would go so far to spread out such rumors about him. Who was trying smear his name? Who was it that wanted him to be notoriously infamous?</p><p>He didn’t notice that many people in the restaurant were looking at him. He didn’t realize that his action of sending his four henchmen to beat these four passersby out of fury had all been witnessed by these people. All rumors heard were confirmed by witnessing the deeds. It was for this reason that every rumor that slandered him had been deliberately carried out and now taken seriously in everyone’s eyes.</p><p>At the side, the eyes of the old man leader filled with chilling light and he said, “Someone must have intentionally spread the rumors, Young Lord. They definitely want to ruin your reputation. Your subordinate will find them and make them die without a burial ground!”</p><p>“Investigate and find them!” Scarless Hunter snapped. “Those who dare bully me must be torn into pieces!”</p><p>Everyone who witnessed this scene exchanged glances.</p><p>Killing the culprits so they would die without burial grounds? Even going so far as to shred them to pieces?</p><p>Just from the statement alone, it was enough to see how vicious this person was!</p><p>The passerby whose limbs were discarded and left on the floor suddenly looked horrified and cried out, “I, I know who the rumormonger is! They have left Green Summit Bazaar and I overheard they’re heading to the Blackwind Woods!”</p><p>“Who are these people?” shouted Scarless Hunter aloud.</p><p>“I dunno. We really have no idea who they are!” The passerby desperately replied, “I just heard there’s someone among them spreading the rumors and, after shouting that, he said that they’re going to the Blackwind Woods to hunt some beasts. But we’re not sure if he’s the first person who spread the rumors.”</p><p>“I don’t give a fuck whether he’s the culprit or not. Those who dare to fabricate and spread rumors to slander me must pay a painful price.” Scarless Hunter coldly hummed. “Let’s head to the Blackwind Woods!”</p><p>At the side, one of the Golden Immortal oldsters said, “Young Master, this is unreliable news. Those people did not necessarily go to the Blackwind Woods!”</p><p>“I’d rather believe it than to have no leads whatsoever!” Scarless Hunter sneered. “We’ll definitely find those punks as long as we follow the leads.”</p><p>15 minutes later.</p><p>Scarless Hunter, along with his four Golden Immortal subordinates, appeared at the street junction of Green Summit Bazaar. His sharp eyes swept across the side of the teahouse and he snorted coldly before leaving.</p><p>He believed that the guy who scolded him was the kind who would go soft after getting subdued. Yet, he was still far better than those who spread the rumors and slandered him, the kind he hated the most.</p><p>15 minutes passed by.</p><p>Tang Xiu led Tang Ahlang, Dragonfly, and Battle Peng towards the Blackwind Woods direction given by the other six Golden Immortal subordinates. They advanced moderately, and half an hour later, they appeared near a group of people fighting.</p><p>BOOM…</p><p>A streak of light struck the chest of an early-stage Golden Immortal from the Hunter Clan, causing his body to fly upside down like a snapped kite. Scarless Hunter and the other three Golden Immortals looked terrified. They wanted to rescue their companions, but these six enemies were so strong that they were left in despair.</p><p>“IT’S HIM!!!”</p><p>The moment Scarless Hunter saw Tang Xiu’s group, the look of despair on his face turned more visible. At this moment, he would be stupid if he was unable to realize that all this farce was aimed to trap him. He could even tell that the very people who spread the rumors to slander him were Tang Xiu and his men.</p><p>“Who the hell are you, thief punk?!” Scarless Hunter furiously growled while fighting back desperately.</p><p>Wearing a contemptuous smile, Tang Xiu laughed aloud and said, “Heh, no need to know who I am. It was you who chose to be a foolish ghost. Meh, wrong. You’re gonna be the goners as it’s impossible for you to be a confused ghost, no?”</p><p>“You voluntarily admitted defeat at Green Summit Bazaar!” Scarless Hunter furiously growled again. “Was it intentional on your part?”</p><p>“Of course it was!” Tang Xiu smilingly replied, “If I didn’t do it on purpose, wouldn’t that be so cheap for that Great Demon shop owner since you’d give him your millions of Immortal Crystals? Instead of giving him free money, I might as well leave it for me to grab. Speaking of it, I gotta thank you. I wouldn’t have dared spend all my Immortal Crystals and Crystal Essences if you didn’t aim your killing intent at me.”</p><p>“Are you not afraid of my Hunter Clan’s revenge?” Scarless Hunter shouted angrily.</p><p>“Heh, killing and destroying is what I’m best at.” Tang Xiu sneered. “You think your Hunter Clan will find out who killed you today? Hey, you guys, do best and take care of your safety!”</p><p>“Understood!”</p><p>The six Golden Immortals no longer held back. All of them were ruthless characters who frequented the edge of life and death countless times. Even their artifacts and weapons were refined by Tang Xiu, causing their power to soar compared to before.</p><p>Slash! Slash! Slash!</p><p>Sword beams kept flickering accompanied by blade light flying in all directions.</p><p>Scarless Hunter only watched as his three Golden Immortal protectors got slaughtered easily by the enemy. Even their Immortal Souls couldn’t escape and were twisted and crushed by Immortal Swords and artifacts into oblivion. He had been through many crises before, yet he had never been so close to death like now.</p><p>“D-Don’t kill me, I’ll give you back the Poison Miasma Pill and another 10 million Immortal Crystals!”</p><p>Tang Xiu rolled his eyes and scolded him. “Are you an idiot?! As long as you’re killed, that Poison Miasma Pill and the 10 million Immortal Crystals won’t be the only things that will be mine. All your wealth will be mine! Take him on and kill him!”</p><p>Puff…</p><p>Scarless Hunter was beheaded and his body shattered in an instant. Even his Immortal Soul was destroyed by Sword Qi and disappeared between Heaven and Earth.</p><p>Tang Xiu received 5 interspatial rings. After erasing the marks on them, his spiritual sense swept through the space inside and he immediately looked happy. He found quite a lot of wealth in them. There were 2.4 million Crystal Essences alone and countless Immortal Stones and Crystals. The total wealth added up was worth more than 310 million.</p><p>Further, there were also a lot of cultivation resources and many precious items in Scarless Hunter’s ring. As for the rings of the other four Golden Immortals, there were also a large number of Immortal Stones, Crystals, and Crystal Essences. The final number after he counted them was 4.6 million Crystal Essences, 120 million Immortal Crystals, and 80 million Immortal Stones. The rest of the items were worth around 5 million Crystal Essences.</p><p>“Destroy the traces of the fight and evacuate immediately!”</p><p>Tang Xiu was reluctant to clash with the Hunter Clan. He was perfectly aware that the current strength of the Great Tang Empire was not yet able to take on this clan. After all, this clan had a Perfected Golden Immortal at the helm. Once both sides fought, even if they were able to find foreign aid and had Nine Nether Swordmeister’s help, they were bound to suffer huge losses.</p><p>Two hours later.</p><p>Tang Xiu had left the scene by tens of thousands of kilometers when tens of figures flickered and moved lightning fast in the Blackwind Woods. All these figures were experts from the Hunter Clan. The clan’s ancestor had conjured a secret art and finally determined the place where the five people were killed, which pointed to this place.</p><p>However, they searched hard for a long time only to find traces of fight here, but they were unable to find the remains of Scarless Hunter’s group of five. In the next few days, they even searched the entire Green Summit Bazaar, collecting various news and intel, yet no information about the murderer could be found.</p><p>In the Dark Court.</p><p>The round ball-like Demon Venerable watched as the several powerhouses of the Hunter clan left with gleaming eyes. He didn’t expect that the young man who bought a lot of things here turned out to have such great courage to kill the Hunter Clan’s young Lord. It must be noted that in the Hessen Castle Immortal Domain, aside from Madame Empyrean Lady and two other clans that were stronger than the Hunter Clan, there was no other that could take on the Hunters. Killing this clan’s young Lord was as bold as it was audacious.</p><p>“Listen! You’re forbidden to reveal even half a word of anything that has transpired here, capiche? Else, don’t blame me for being ruthless.” Great Demon Venerable spoke with all seriousness after being silent for a long while.</p><p>Several men nodded one after another. One of them then curiously said, “Venerable, do you think that person was…”</p><p>“Shut up!” Great Demon Venerable coldly shut him off.</p><p>The man shrunk and looked terrified.</p><p>Great Demon Venerable forced a wry smile and said, “We’re business people. Our purpose is to make money. We’re not to get involved in any affairs that arise out of anything. Besides, I have a hunch that Hessen Castle won’t be quiet in the future.”</p><p>Another man looked puzzled and said, “Venerable one, even if the Hunter Clan’s young Lord was killed, it won’t necessarily have any impact on the entire situation of Hessen Castle, right? At most, the Hunters will just cause some trouble.”</p><p>Great Demon Venerable sneered. “Do you think that fella is some weak layman even if he dares to kill the Hunter’s Young Master? Do you think he has no eminent background himself? Most importantly, the Hunter’s Young Master himself was very strong and his four henchmen were Golden Immortal powerhouses. Yet they can be slaughtered silently and all the traces have been erased. Do you think such a party is weak?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
