He may have made a mistake due to strange circumstances or this might be just a coincidence. But nonetheless, Tang Xiu decided to no longer blend in the turbid waters with Nine Nether Swordmeister.</p><p>“Alright, let’s get started.”</p><p>Tang Xiu got up and let Star Tears return to the Heavenly Abode artifact and brought only Battle Peng out of Inkwell Pen Mansion. After returning to Stargazing Pavilion, he then immediately issued an order: All members of the Great Tang Empire are to return from the outside world immediately!</p><p>Two days later, all the members of the Great Tang Empire had returned, including Seaway Monarch and Zenith Venerable who went to ambush Vastly Martial Nightwolf. Aside from Gu Yan’er and Battle Peng staying in the outside world, the rest disappeared from the Stargazing Pavilion and entered the Heavenly Abode artifact.</p><p>Tang Xiu was well aware that Nine Nether Swordmeister might have already known that he had brought his people and left. It was even very likely that he was hiding in some hidden spot watching them leave.</p><p>Heavenly Net Immortal Domain.</p><p>Just as Tang Xiu stepped out of the spatial teleportation array, he looked at the surroundings and sensed some killing intents around. He didn’t bother about the immortal soldiers stationed here and just quickly left with Gu Yan’er and Battle Peng.</p><p>“We seem to be going the wrong way, Master,” Gu Yan’er suddenly spoke while observing the surrounding environment after they flew for half a day.</p><p>“No, we’re not lost.” Tang Xiu said lightly, “I’ve prepared to wander around the Heavenly Net Immortal Domain since this region is quite bustling and large. There are some good things that can be found here, and I plan to come back here in the future.”</p><p>A suspicious look flashed in Gu Yan’er’s eyes and she asked with a voice transmission, “What do you mean, Master?”</p><p>Replying with a voice transmission, Tang Xiu said, “We have just returned to the Immortal World recently, yet we run into Kitty and Aunty Star Tears. Both of them have become deathmatch fighters. That means that many people close to us are scattered about living in various places in the Immortal World. They are perhaps now in imminent danger, so we might as well delay our pace on the road while trying to find those who need our help as much as possible.”</p><p>“What are you going to do after you find them?” asked Gu Yan’er hurriedly.</p><p>“Unless they are our closest people, we’ll only help them while in passing. But we won’t take them with us so as not to expose our identity,” said Tang Xiu lightly.</p><p>“So we’re now doing all that is humanly possible and let destiny guide us?” asked Gu Yan’er.</p><p>“Something like that.” Tang Xiu nodded unobtrusively.</p><p>In the following three months, Tang Xiu took Gu Yan’er and Battle Peng across every area of the Heavenly Net Immortal Domain and passed every bustling city. Aside from purchasing the needed cultivation resources in large numbers, they had yet to find any of their old acquaintances.</p><p>Therefore, the trio embarked on another journey and passed through another Immortal Domain. When they entered another Immortal Domain, they met some people from the Vermillion Bird Holy Sect and some people who used to be their subordinates. In short, through the journey, Tang Xiu realized that many people under him had gone through the persecution of the enemies after he got betrayed. He also clearly inquired about the current situation of the Vermillion Bird Holy Sect.</p><p>The sect was in deep trouble and miserable. The Vermillion Bird Holy Sect had completely retreated to their holy ground and now relied upon the two Supremacy Stage experts in the sect to protect the sect’s defensive protection array.</p><p>Further, some of Tang Xiu’s loyal subordinates had joined the Vermillion Bird Holy Sect and fought side-by-side with the sect. Some were hiding in some places in the Immortal World, whereas others were working independently.</p><p>Greenwood Immortal Domain.</p><p>Four snow-white beasts pulled a golden barouche and traversed the road fast. Two figures on the golden barouche sat cross-legged in a state of cultivation, whereas a burly man beside them looked around observing with an indifferent expression.</p><p>They were Tang Xiu, Gu Yan’er, and Battle Peng, who was on guard duty.</p><p>80% of the landmass in the Greenwood Immortal Region was covered by lush and verdant mountains and woodlands. Other than huge cities, the rest of the region consisted of seas and lakes. It was known that the peace-loving Forest Elf race lived in the particularly massive land in the Greenwood Immortal Domain, where dozens of branches of the Forest Elf race lived.</p><p>BOOM…</p><p>A terrifying aura suddenly burst from the distance and reached the golden barouche.</p><p>Tang Xiu’s and Gu Yan’er’s eyes abruptly opened at the same time. With a surprised look, they glanced at the direction of that aura and Tang Xiu asked with furrowed brows, “What happened? My vision can’t reach that far.”</p><p>“I can’t see anything either.” Gu Yan’er shook her head.</p><p>Although Battle Peng didn’t speak, he also looked confused and showed that he had no idea of what happened either.</p><p>After hesitating for a moment, Tang Xiu said, “The fight happened out of our range of sight, but we can sense the aura from here. That means the fight should be between Perfected Golden Immortals. Let’s head there and have a look.”</p><p>Battle Peng slightly nodded and shouted at four Cloudpiercer beasts, “Speed up!”</p><p>The Cloudpiercer beasts were all powerful Immortal Beasts and each was comparable to an ordinary Immortal. Coupled with the golden barouche artifact, both fetched an extremely high price. If it wasn’t for Tang Xiu who found some treasures in some Immortal Domains and exchanged them into Immortal Crystals, he wouldn’t have been able to buy them.</p><p>A few minutes after, the fighting scene finally appeared before the trio’s eyes. Above the lush and dense forest, several Forest Elves were being attacked by four strong big men.</p><p>“Dragon Clan?”</p><p>Tang Xiu and Gu Yan’er exchanged glances and both looked confused.</p><p>Forest Elves had always been on good terms with the Dragon Clan. The Supremacy Stage expert of the Elves and the Supreme Patriarch of the Dragon Clan were best friends whose friendship was known throughout the Immortal World. Yet they now encountered these Forest Elves fighting the Dragon Clan? A truly rare occasion.</p><p>At the same time, the two sides also found Tang Xiu’s group of three approaching. The four Dragon clansmen immediately forced back the several Forest Elves and revealed their main bodies. In just a flash, four of them morphed into four long, silvery giant dragons hundreds of meters long.</p><p>“Sendoya, hand over the Luminous Immortal Speculum, only then you can go without dying! Otherwise, we’ll kill all of you even if there are outsiders here.” One of the silver dragons growled, and the killing aura emanating from it blotted out the sky.</p><p>The Forest Elves were obviously the suppressed side, and many of them had ghastly wounds. After hearing that silver dragon’s demand, the tall forest elf who fanned her wings paced a few steps forward and coldly said, “The Luminous Immortal Speculum is the artifact protection of my Blood Elf Clan. We’ll never give it to you even if you exterminate all the Blood Elves as a race. Ao Xiang, you’re an elder of Dragon Clan, yet you dare to rob the protection artifact of my Blood Elf Clan? Do you really want to provoke a war between our two races?”</p><p>The silver dragon named Ao Xiang sneered. “Just your Blood Elf Clan alone is not enough to cause a war between our two races. Further, the Blood Elf is getting fewer in numbers. If my guess is on the mark, the number of your clansmen shouldn’t be over 100 now, no? Leaving the Luminous Immortal Speculum artifact in your clan is just a complete waste and might as well give it to me, so I can make the Purple Elf Clan’s princess happy.”</p><p>Looking at Ao Xiang with obvious hostility, Sendoya furiously growled. “My Blood Elf Clan previously had a large population and we were the strongest lineage of the entire Forest Elves aside from the Royal Family. Even your Dragon Clan fawned upon us at that time. Have you forgotten that? Is this the real nature of your Dragon race?”</p><p>Ao Xiang was furious upon hearing Sendoya’s retort. His huge head immediately pointed to Tang Xiu and shouted fiercely, “I advise you not to poke your nose in our business. Else, you’ll become the Dragon Clan’s enemy!”</p><p>Tang Xiu slanted his brows and ignored him completely. He looked at Sendoya instead and asked aloud, “Hey, I heard the remaining population of your Blood Elf Clan is now less than 100. Is that true?”</p><p>Sendoya shifted to Tang Xiu vigilantly and replied in a deep voice, “That’s right, countless clansmen of our Blood Elf have died in battle. But as long as anyone of us is alive, we can lead our tribe to rise again in the future.”</p><p>“Haih, the Blood Elves were known as the battle maniacs of the Forest Elves. You were indeed the strongest lineage of the Forest Elves. But who would have thought that your Blood Elf Clan would end up so miserable in just tens of thousands of years? If my guess is right, your Blood Elf Clan should have now been excluded from the Elves race, right?”</p><p>Sendoya’s expression became extremely ugly. She was the leader of the Blood Elves and naturally knew their current situation.</p><p>Their current situation was bad or rather… terrible.</p><p>She was even perfectly aware of one thing. Ao Xiang and these four bastards came to attack them to snatch the Luminous Immortal Speculum. The Royal Family of the elves must have known about this, yet they didn’t even help them and just shut their eyes and ears. Their attitude was completely obvious.</p><p>Tang Xiu slightly smiled and he could tell many problems from seeing Sendoya’s expression alone. His thoughts raced and he smilingly said, “Anyway, we’re just passing by and are kind of too lazy to poke our nose into your issues. But we don’t mind trying to help anyone who is in trouble. Your name is Sendoya, yes? Rather than having your Blood Elf lineage live here in suffocation, you might as well leave this place directly and seek shelter elsewhere.”</p><p>Sendoya shot an indifferent look at Tang Xiu and asked, “Who are you?”</p><p>“I’m the Majesty Sovereign of the Great Tang Empire. You can call me Great Tang Heavenly Emperor,” Tang Xiu replied with a smile. “If your Blood Elf lineage is willing to leave with me, I’ll allow you to live in my Great Tang Empire.”</p><p>Sendoya pondered for a moment before shaking her head and said, “The Greenwood Immortal Domain is a place suitable for the survival of the Elves. Besides, why do you think you can convince us to leave with just a few words from you? Just leave. We don’t need your help.”</p><p>Tang Xiu burst into laughter in response before summoning Zenith Venerable and Seaway Monarch from the Heavenly Abode artifact. Pointing to Ao Xiang and the other dragons, he lightly ordered, “Kick them out of this place. If they don’t want to leave, butcher them!”</p><p>Ao Xiang looked terrified and snarled. “Your name is Great Tang Heavenly Emperor? Do you really want to meddle in our business?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
