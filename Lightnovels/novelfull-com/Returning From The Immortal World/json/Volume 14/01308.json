He suddenly had a bad hunch and hurriedly asked, “Are you perhaps carrying a Heavenly Abode artifact or something?”</p><p>“That’s right. We’re carrying such a Heavenly Abode artifact, indeed,” Tang Xiu replied with a nod. “I thought we had to spend quite a lot visiting this place, but well, I never thought Fellow Immortal would be so generously straightforward to exempt all of us for some free meals, though. Well, frequenting the Stargazing Pavilion all these years does feel worthwhile now.”</p><p>“Ugh…”</p><p>The old Golden Immortal looked a bit helpless. He did have the intention to exempt Tang Xiu and Gu Yan’er, yet he didn’t expect for them to be carrying a Heavenly Abode artifact. The Stargazing Pavilion would likely lose a fortune if there were too many people in it.</p><p>“Anyhow, please lead the day, Immortal friend!” Tang Xiu smilingly said, “Also, aside from having enough to drink and eat, I think we still need to stay here for two days. I’m guessing that Madame Empyrean Pole will come back, and she will definitely look for me.”</p><p><em>What does he mean? Her Ladyship is going to find him when she comes back?</em></p><p>The elderly Golden Immortal’s expression shifted and he immediately replied, “Please come in, two honorable guests. Blame me for my extravagant boasting, but taking back my words is not an option. Further, I already mentioned that you’ve helped Her Ladyship, thus it should be our responsibility to entertain you lavishly.”</p><p>On the 88th floor of the tower.</p><p>The floor was enough to accommodate hundreds of thousands of diners at the same time, that’s why Tang Xiu brought all the Great Tang Empire’s members out of the Heavenly Abode artifact. Everyone immediately realized the situation after Tang Xiu’s explanation and they immediately anticipated the rumored great dishes of the Immortal World.</p><p>However, the elderly Golden Immortal’s face looked very regretful upon seeing over 200,000 members of the Great Tang Empire. It would’ve been fine had Tang Xiu chosen the other tower. After all, the dishes of the other minarets were much worse than this middle tower.</p><p><em>Damn it. It will definitely take at least a year to make up for the loss of having these 200,000 people eat here. I surely would’ve never boasted so excessively had I known about this earlier.</em></p><p>Feeling regretful inwardly, the elderly Golden Immortal squeezed out a smile and ordered the kitchen to cook the dishes after the orders were done. It was not until he left the tower that he shook his head with a bitter smile. He recalled that he invited them to dine here due to the favor Tang Xiu gave to his Master, Madame Empyrean Pole. More so that they accepted his offer since it was free!</p><p>For the last two days, only meals and delicacies filled the heads of the Great Tang Empire’s members. To their shock and surprise, however, they found that the specialty dishes actually contained enormous energy and just one bite was much more beneficial than absorbing 10 Immortal Stones.</p><p>After the episode of pigging out to their hearts’ content, Tang Xiu put all of them back in the Heavenly Abode artifact. Due to having eaten such dishes for two full days, nearly all the Great Tang Empire’s members below the Immortal Stage had their cultivation level progress sharply and all of them advanced a level.</p><p>Outside the Stargazing Pavilion.</p><p>Both Tang Xiu and Gu Yan’er turned back and let out quirky smiles as the elderly Golden Immortal standing at the gate wiped off the sweat on his forehead.</p><p>“What do you think, Master? Will that guy slap his own face due to distress?” Gu Yan’er smirked and said, “Estimating the cost, I think it should be at least in the tens of millions of Immortal Crystals. Besides, many guys brought the Immortal Wine they haven’t finished drinking to the Heavenly Abode artifact as well. I’m pretty sure they will keep it and drink it slowly later.”</p><p>“The conservative estimation is roughly in the tens of millions, indeed. Such a dignified Golden Immortal supervisor of the Stargazing Pavilion wouldn’t have sweated so much due to anxiety and pain. I figure he’ll definitely relax after we leave.” Tang Xiu chuckled.</p><p>“Hehe…”</p><p>Gu Yan’er held Tang Xiu’s arm and smilingly said, “Well, to benefit is a chance hard to come by. And I think it’s time for us to buy some hatched men.”</p><p>“Let’s head to the largest Convict Arena Prison in Moongazing Monarch City, then. We can spend quite a lot since we are no longer short of money.” Tang Xiu nodded.</p><p>Gu Yan’er’s smile was particularly bright. After all, the 1 million Immortal Crystals given by Madame Empyrean Pole was by no means a small amount. At the very least, it would be enough for them to use it for a long time given their present situation.</p><p>Moongazing Monarch City, Convict Arena Prison.</p><p>As Tang Xiu and Gu Yan’er came here, an attendant directly led them to the prison cells for Immortals. At this time, a fierce fight was currently being held in the arena with both fighters at the Profound Immortal Stage.</p><p>“Two distinguished guests, you can call me should you require anything in the Convict Arena. My name is Light Rain and I guarantee the best service to the greatest of my abilities,” said the beautiful attendant smilingly.</p><p>Tang Xiu slightly nodded at her in response. Then, he shifted his attention to the deathmatch fighters in the cells and read their information. Finally, he spoke, “I want to buy 20 Golden Immortal gladiators. Tell your supervisor to state the price.”</p><p>Light Rain’s expression changed. Her attitude immediately became respectful as she replied, “Two distinguished guests, I’d like to apologize since I need to ask you to please wait for a while. No one has ever bought so many Golden Immortal gladiators. I’m going to report to my supervisor first and she shall attend to you personally.”</p><p>15 minutes passed.</p><p>An alluring and gorgeous belle giving off amorous charm came toward them guided by Light Rain. Her eyes, which looked like drizzling raindrops, quietly observed Tang Xiu and Gu Yan’er before she said with a smiling face, “I heard the two distinguished guests would like to purchase 20 gladiators at Golden Immortal Stage. I wonder if this is true?”</p><p>“That’s correct,” Tang Xiu replied. “We indeed plan to buy 20 death warriors, each at Golden Immortal Stage. The higher their cultivation level, the stronger they are, the more perfect. I’d like Manager to state the price to us.”</p><p>The belle thought for a while and then replied, “We have a total of 209 death warriors at the Golden Immortal Stage here. 29 at the Late-stage, 62 Mid-stage, and the rest are at the Early-stage. You just mentioned that the higher their cultivation level and the stronger they are the better, yes? Then I can only recommend you the gladiators at the Late-stage.”</p><p>“The price, please,” said Tang Xiu calmly.</p><p>“Based on the market price, every late-stage Golden Immortal gladiator is worth 8 million Immortal Crystals. You plan to purchase 20 of them, so the total sum will be 160 million Immortal Crystals. I can give you a discount of 10 million, so you only need to pay 150 million Immortal Crystals, and then you can take away these 20 late-stage Golden Immortal gladiators.”</p><p>150 million Immortal Crystals?</p><p>Tang Xiu forced a wry smile inwardly. He thought that having 1 million Crystal Essences should have been enough to buy 20 late-stage Golden Immortal gladiators, but he didn’t expect a late-stage Golden Immortal gladiator to be so expensive. After taking a deep breath, he said, “I feel assured since you have a sufficient number of Golden Immortal death warriors. Anyhow, I’d like to have some fun and enjoy myself here first before we carry on the business. You can go tend to your business and leave this Miss Light Rain to accompany us, so we can contact you when we’re done playing.”</p><p>The belle smilingly replied upon hearing it, “If so, then I shall refrain from disturbing you. Little Rain, do entertain our two distinguished guests well, else you can expect me to throw you into the cell and be a gladiator yourself.”</p><p>Light Rain’s face drastically changed and she immediately replied with an extremely fearful expression, “I’ll absolutely give my best to serve these two distinguished guests, Manager!”</p><p>Tang Xiu faintly smiled and watched the belle leave. Then, he said, “Anyway, let’s head to the colosseum to watch the fight! Only coming here to buy some gladiators without doing anything else would be too boring.”</p><p>With that said, he handed an interspatial ring with 2 million Immortal Crystals to Light Rain and then lightly said, “Help me exchange it for some chips.”</p><p>“Acknowledged.”</p><p>Light Rain slightly nodded and respectfully replied. She took the interspatial ring and then left.</p><p>The current fight inside the convict arena was very fierce and intense, but Tang Xiu himself didn’t pay much attention to it. It was because near the position where he was sitting, a big-eared and pugnacious-looking fat middle-aged man was hugging two voluptuous women while teasing them. His voice and laughter were so loud that several gamblers around him frowned and glared at him.</p><p>The big-eared and big-headed middle-aged fatty seemed to notice it. He glared back at them and angrily shouted, “What the fuck are you looking at? Watch out for this fatty gouging out your eyeballs, dickheads. Damn, some ragtag shits dare to provoke this Master Fatty? You really got some fucking balls!”</p><p>“You’re dead!”</p><p>A hot-tempered black-robed oldster glared at the middle-aged fatty with his triangular eyes as he suddenly got up and shouted. Yet, he didn’t attack because he was afraid of the Convict Arena’s rules which stated that one must pay a 1 million Immortal Crystals penalty for each murder here, else it would be seen as a provocation to the entire Convict Arena. Should it happen, the violator would be endlessly chased by countless powerhouses from the Convict Arena.</p><p>No one knew how powerful the Convict Arena was. It was an existence that had been around since hundreds of thousands of years ago and nobody knew or even could ask around who the Master behind the Convict Arena was, either.</p><p>The alluring woman in the middle-aged fatty’s left arm turned into a streak of light and instantly appeared in front of the black-robed hot-tempered oldster. A green smoke spewed out of her sleeve all of a sudden as a sharp short sword flashed and instantly pierced the old man’s throat.</p><p>In the next moment, the voluptuous woman’s ten fingernails began to grow crazily. Right as her nails were two-plus centimeters in length, she moved lightning-fast and her ten sharp nails ripped the man’s robe and destroyed his immortal defensive artifact while tearing his immortal body into dozens of bloody pieces of flesh.</p><p>The unfolding scene was so shocking that the several middle-aged gamblers who glared at the middle-aged fatty looked horrified and panicked. All of them backed away and flashed to the distance. That poor robed old man just expelled out his aura a moment ago. He was a Profound Immortal, yet it only took an instant for that middle-aged fatty’s woman to kill him—a display that scared and sent a chill down their spines.</p><p>Tang Xiu observed the scene calmly while silently guessing the cultivation level of the female immortal. After a short time, he inferred that the female immortal had at least a mid-stage or late-stage Golden Immortal cultivation as it would have been otherwise impossible for her to slay a Profound Immortal in an instant.</p><p>After the alluring woman finished the killing, she turned back into her previous amorous woman style again, drilling her way into the middle-aged fatty’s embrace after returning.</p><p>It was like she was not the brutal murderer who just carried out such a cruel killing a moment ago.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
