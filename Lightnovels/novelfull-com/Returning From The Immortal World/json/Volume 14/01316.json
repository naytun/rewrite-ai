If it wasn’t for the conflict with that burly man, he had planned to save some money and keep it for a rainy day. But now, what he wanted to do was spend money crazily, at least clean up all his Immortal Stones, Crystals, and Crystal Essences for now.</p><p>“This is crazy…”</p><p>Festoon Dragonfly had already realized previously that Tang Xiu was a rich man, but he never thought Tang Xiu’s wealth would be this mind-blowing. In just 3 days, he secretly calculated the sum of money Tang Xiu spent. The total number of Tang Xiu’s spending had exceeded hundreds of millions of Immortal Crystals.</p><p>That was hundreds of millions—a billion, for God’s sake!</p><p>Despite having heard that many super-powerful people had wealth in the hundreds of millions of Immortal Crystals, Dragonfly never imagined that some people would just spend so much wealth in just a few days.</p><p>“It’s pretty much done.” Tang Xiu was satisfied when they left a store.</p><p>The aftermath of spending hundreds of millions of Immortal Stones was that he no longer needed to worry about cultivation resources for a long time in the future. The resources he had now were even enough to advance up to the 9th minor stage of the second big stage of the Heavenly Art of Cosmic Genesis. Once he reached this 9th minor stage, his power would be comparable to peak Golden Immortal experts. It was even likely that he had what it took to take on mid-stage Perfected Golden Immortal.</p><p>Tang Xiu looked at the ass-kissing Festoon Dragonfly. He raised his hand and patted the guy’s shoulder before taking out 10 Crystal Essences and handing them to him. “These are your rewards for helping me shop and bargain in these four days.”</p><p>Dragonfly’s expression became dull and incredulity filled his eyes. Even the hands holding the 10 Crystal Essences shivered slightly.</p><p>Crystal Essence? And even 10 of them?</p><p>It must be known that 1 Crystal Essence could be exchanged to 10,000 Immortal Stones. 10 of them were exactly 100,000 Immortal Stones.</p><p>Dragonfly had lived for a century or so and now was a Nascent Soul expert. But he never dreamed that he could earn 100,000 Immortal Stones in his life, such a huge number in his eyes.</p><p>Tang Xiu lightly smiled in response and couldn’t help but feel a bit apologetic inwardly. He really didn’t mind giving more to this guy, but he only had 10 Crystal Essences left.</p><p>“Well, let’s see each other again later, shall we?”</p><p>After saying that, he took Tang Ahlang, Battle Peng, and the other 6 Golden Immortals to the border of Green Summit Bazaar.</p><p>While holding the 10 Crystal Essences, Dragonfly slowly lifted his head and looked at Tang Xiu’s back. His lips wriggled a few times and his aura suddenly burst out. Although he was very weak, tenacity and firmness filled his eyes. He straightly knelt in the direction of Tang Xiu’s departure and shouted, “Sir, could you take me under you? I’m willing to follow you for eternity!”</p><p>Tang Xiu’s pace halted. As the eight people behind him gave way, Tang Xiu looked at Dragonfly kneeling on his knees with a strange expression.</p><p>Déjà vu. It was a thousand years ago, wasn’t it?</p><p>How similar are the eyes of this Festoon Dragonfly brat to those of the ragged and dirty little beggar? Eyes filled with gratitude, pleading, yet full of firmness and tenacity?</p><p>Tang Xiu still remembered the little beggar, who he took in as a disciple. The boy followed him and devoted himself to cultivation until he became a Perfected Golden Immortal expert. It was him who accidentally said that he wished to have a bizarre flower in the endless abyss. Little Beggar crossed through thousands of Immortal Domains to the endless abyss, venturing deep with only a slim chance to survive just to take that strange flower out.</p><p>It was precisely due to that bizarre flower that made Little Beggar become a target of pursuit by a large mob of Perfected Golden Immortals across many Immortal Domains.</p><p>At that time, Tang Xiu was too late. He slaughtered all the Perfected Golden Immortals there the moment he arrived and finally took the dying Little Beggar. He took that flower with tearful eyes as he watched his final moment as his soul disappeared.</p><p>It was also at that time Tang Xiu began slaughtering the whole sects and clans of the culprits. A total of more than 48,000 Immortals, including one Supreme, 30-plus Perfected Golden Immortals, and too many Golden Immortals to count.</p><p>Step by step, Tang Xiu stopped in front of Dragonfly, scrutinized those familiar eyes, and murmured, “Give me a reason.”</p><p>“I’ll give you my life and work for you. And you will make me stronger.”</p><p>Tang Xiu’s heart twitched a few times. He could hardly believe his ears. It was the same question he asked Little Beggar, and that was the answer Little Beggar gave him.</p><p>That’s right. It’s exactly the same, not even a word wrong or missing.</p><p>Tang Xiu clenched his fists and slowly loosened them. He reached out to pick up Dragonfly and spoke with each word emphasized, “Dragonfly, you’re now my disciple starting from today. I want you to work for me, but in exchange, I demand you to become stronger.”</p><p>“Master.”</p><p>Dragonfly knelt down again and directly knocked his head thrice at Tang Xiu.</p><p>It was the chance he had been longing for—a long wish of becoming stronger.</p><p>In his eyes, although Tang Xiu was just an ordinary Immortal and shouldn’t have reached the Earth Immortal Stage, he believed the real Tang Xiu was very powerful. After all, not just anyone had 7 Golden Immortals as bodyguards.</p><p>Tang Ahlang was smiling. This time, he reached out and pulled Dragonfly up and smilingly said, “My name is Tang Ahlang, please call me Senior Martial Brother Ahlang.”</p><p>Dragonfly was stunned and then called out respectfully, “Senior Martial Brother Ahlang.”</p><p>Tang Ahlang’s smile turned more brilliant. He took out 9 Crystal Essences from his interspatial ring and handed them to Dragonfly. “Master just gave you 10 Crystal Essences. I can’t give you more than Master gave you, so I’ll give 9. Count it as a red envelope Senior Martial Brother gave you for the first meeting!”</p><p>“Thank you, Senior Martial Brother Ahlang!” Dragonfly gratefully replied.</p><p>Tang Xiu smiled and asked, “Do you still have anything that concerns your mind here? We’re not from Hessen Castle and will be leaving this Immortal Domain in a few months.”</p><p>“I have no parents and no siblings,” said Dragonfly. “There’s only a friend who left with a caravan 2 years ago and is not in this Immortal Domain.”</p><p>“In that case, then follow me.” Tang Xiu nodded. “When you become strong in the future, there will be a day to meet your friend as long as he’s still alive.”</p><p>“Understood.”</p><p>Dragonfly nodded with a firm look in his eyes. He understood what Tang Xiu meant. It was indeed close to impossible to meet his friend again in this boundless Immortal World. There was only one way to meet his friend again, and that was to become a genuine powerhouse so that the whole Immortal World knew his name. At that time, he would only need to speak out a word and countless people would help him find his friend. It was even possible that his friend would find him knowing his name.</p><p>At the intersection of the street of Green Summit Bazaar.</p><p>Tang Xiu sat in tranquility in the teahouse near the gate, looking at the street below the window while savoring a cup of immortal tea.</p><p>Beside him, aside from Tang Ahlang and Dragonfly, there was only Battle Peng and a Golden Immortal. The other six Golden Immortals had unknowingly disappeared.</p><p>Half a day passed by in a flash.</p><p>One of the Golden Immortals named Kahl appeared in front of Tang Xiu. The man’s eyes gleamed as he reported, “I’ve clearly investigated it, Master. That person is the Hunter Clan’s Young Master from Hessen Castle, a Sword Immortal named Scarless Hunter. Those four men around him are Golden Immortals responsible to protect him.”</p><p>“You know where this guy is now?” asked Tang Xiu</p><p>“Tipsy Lunar House,” Kahl said. “The six of them are secretly watching.”</p><p>“It’s not suitable for us to take action in Green Summit Bazaar, so we’ll wait and see! He shouldn’t be some dirt-poor layman given his status as a Young Master. I hope he won’t let me down!”</p><p>“I got an idea that can make him leave that place earlier, Master,” said Tang Ahlang with a smile.</p><p>“What idea?” asked Tang Xiu.</p><p>Tang Ahlang leaned closer to Tang Xiu and whispered a few words.</p><p>The smile on Tang Xiu’s face brightened and he happily nodded in approval. “Well, the method may be crooked, but it’s indeed the simplest and most effective. Carry it out! Make him leave Green Summit Bazaar ASAP.”</p><p>At Tipsy Lunar House.</p><p>Touted as the most upscale restaurant in Green Summit Bazaar, the site was known to serve gourmet dishes and fine wines, which made countless people who loved savoring good food stay and forget to go home while spending gold and silver like there was no tomorrow. As the young Lord of the Hunter Clan, Scarless Hunter had a distinguished status and many preferences in life. Among them being a foodie.</p><p>“Immortal Foie Gras, Skydeer Tongue, and Blue Rubberfish…”</p><p>As the delicious dishes were delivered, Scarless Hunter wolfed them down and kept downing Immortal Wine.</p><p>After finishing the lavish meal, he wiped the corner of his mouth with satisfaction and lamented. “Green Summit Bazaar is indeed a great place. So many special ingredients are unavailable in many places, yet you can find them here. Yeah, this place is so damn great. We have to turn around and buy lots of precious ingredients from the Demon Realm later.”</p><p>“Understood!”</p><p>An old man from the four Golden Immortals replied respectfully.</p><p>Scarless Hunter then turned to look out the window. A smile appeared on the corner of his mouth and he said lightly, “That brat is kind of interesting. He unexpectedly hasn’t left Green Summit Bazaar yet and went on a shopping spree these days. Although many of the goods he bought are of no use to us, they can still be sold at a high price. All of you, listen to me. If he doesn’t leave in 10 days, spray some Soul Chasing Scent on him. As long as he dares to come out of Green Summit Bazaar, I’m gonna take his life and wealth.”</p><p>“This subordinate will definitely deal with this matter handsomely, Young Master,” said the old man respectfully.</p><p>Scarless Hunter happily nodded and said while stroking his chin, “I forgot when was the last time I got scolded by others. How long has it been? I was honestly furious when he swore at me, but now I feel a bit odd. Don’t kill him right away. I’m gonna seal his damn mouth and curse him before killing him.”</p><p>Suddenly, his ears shifted. Half an hour later, his expression was that of disbelief and a flame of anger blazed in his eyes. His gaze shifted to the street below the window and locked on several passers-by who were merrily talking while hurrying on the road. He gritted his teeth and said, “Go and get those punks!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
