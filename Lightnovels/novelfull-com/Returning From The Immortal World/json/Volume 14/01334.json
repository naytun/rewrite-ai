The Misty Spring Ocean is decided to be the site, so Master ordered me to tell you that he’d like to assign some people to carry out a cleaning-up campaign for the entire sphere of influence of the Immortal Lyceum—best to remove all the hidden enemies as much as possible. After we rescue my four martial brothers and sister, the Great Tang Empire will be centered at the Misty Spring Ocean and begins to expand its territory to all directions.”</p><p>“I’ve done such a campaign myself. I’ll look into it and do it myself when necessary. I’ll make sure all the problematic people under me will be cleaned up within a short time.” Apotheosis Bella nodded.</p><p>Having said that, she summoned back the two elderlies and issued an order in a deep voice. “You have 2 hours to gather all our Immortal Crystals and Crystal Essences.”</p><p>The two elderlies exchanged glances and immediately nodded. 2 hours later, they returned with an interspatial ring. The old man then reported, “Venerable, we have more than 450 million Immortal Crystals and 87 million Crystal Essences in our treasure vault. All of them are in this ring.”</p><p>Apotheosis Bella slightly nodded and ordered, “Give it to Apotheon Mu.”</p><p>The old man hesitated and forced a smile. “Venerable, our Immortal Lyceum won’t have even a piece of Immortal Crystal or Crystal Essence left. 6 months later is the day of bestowment, in case we don’t have any Immortal Crystals and Crystals by then…”</p><p>Apotheosis Bella waved her hand. “We’ll naturally have a way by that time.”</p><p>After hearing it, the old man handed the ring with an enormous number of Immortal Crystals and Crystal Essences to Apotheon Mu and then left again with the old woman.</p><p>Apotheosis Bella took a deep breath and looked at Apotheon Mu, saying, “He’s back, so what about her?”</p><p>A murderous intention flashed in Apotheon Mu’s eyes and he replied indifferently, “She was one of the ambushers who besieged Master then.”</p><p>As though hearing the most unbelievable thing in the world, Apotheon Bella blurted out in shock, “Ho can that be? Although she’s my… love rival, no one knows her better than me. I’m very sure she would die for Xiu, but how come…”</p><p>“She wouldn’t have acted to kill Master if it wasn’t for Shade Demon Zhu Wushou,” said Apotheon Mu. “However, she’s Shade Demon’s disciple. After she ambushed Master, she committed suicide on the spot. Nonetheless, the fact that she has harmed Master can never be denied.”</p><p>Apotheosis Bella was now completely shaken.</p><p>Shade Demon Zhu Wushou?</p><p>No wonder Shade Demon’s shadow is always behind Great Emperor Danqing and Zither Demon Jiuyao when they attacked the Vermillion Bird Holy Sect all these years. Even rumors had it that Shade Demon had also personally slaughtered several elders of the Vermillion Bird Holy Sect.</p><p>The rumors turned out to be true. Shade Demon Supreme Zhu Wushou was really one of the enemies.</p><p>Apotheosis Immortal Bella clenched her fists and coldly said, “No matter who they are, whoever dares harm him is my enemy, including her. It’s best that she died. If she’s alive, I’ll never let her have an easy time either.”</p><p>“That can’t be done, Senior Venerable.” Apotheon Mu shook his head and sighed. “Master himself said that she’s alive. But everything that happened between them has all been written off and they are nothing but strangers now. Further, there’s one more thing I need to tell you. Master now has quite a number of women.”</p><p>Apotheosis Bella shivered and looked blank for a long while. Then, she suddenly burst into laughter and said, “Hahaha, he finally repented, huh? Hahaha… he has finally straightened up his mind. Having a lot of women is great! The more the better. I’m happy even if he wants all the women in the Immortal World. Hahaha…”</p><p>“You…!” Apotheon Mu was in disbelief. “Don’t you feel….”</p><p>Apotheosis Bella’s smile was exceptionally bright as she cut him off. “What? Jealous? Why should I be jealous? If he opens his heart for other women, then that means I have my own chance too. What I fear most is that he doesn’t have any interest in other women besides that b*tch!”</p><p>Hearing her overwhelming statement made Apotheon Mu dumbfounded and shocked. He could hardly imagine how deep the love Apotheosis Bella had for his Master was, to think that she had such unconventional thoughts in mind.</p><p>After a long while, Apotheon Mu deeply sighed. “Senior Venerable, I honestly think that Master receiving your feelings should be his proudest and the best thing ever in his life. He may haven’t said anything about this, but I’m sure he has already seen you as one of his closest people already.”</p><p>Apotheosis Bella raised her hand to wipe away the tears coming out of her eyes. Her teary yet brilliant smile was extremely touching. She nodded and emphasized every word she said, “I firmly believe that I’ll soon become one of his closest people, a significant other in the eyes of the people he cares about.”</p><p>“Then I’m looking forward to the day when I can call you Master’s Mistress,” said Apotheon Mu.</p><p>Having said that, Apotheon Mu didn’t stay any longer. After leaving the palace, he left with Zenith Venerable and Seaway Monarch directly. However, before the trio left, Zenith Venerable and Seaway Monarch keenly sensed that a very weak figure appeared at the gate of the palace behind them while watching the three of them leave.</p><p>Suddenly, Apotheon Mu’s body trembled after hearing the words transmitted to his ears. The words pierced through deep in his heart and made him deeply moved and invoked his… admiration.</p><p>“What did I tell you? Master definitely has a deep relationship with Apotheosis Bella Fern Regalia.” Seaway Monarch sent a voice transmission.</p><p>Transmitting his voice to reply, Zenith Venerable said, “Yeah, I’ve seen Apotheosis Bella before. Rumors even have it that she has broken through to the Supremacy Stage. A dignified Supreme powerhouse, yet she’s actually sending us off like this means that Apotheon Mu’s visit was very important. But the important factor for this to happen is very likely because of Master.”</p><p>The exchange between both of them quickly ended.</p><p>At this time the two of them were convinced that there was a deep connection between their Master, Great Tang Heavenly Emperor and Star Cultivation Great Emperor, or at least someone from the Vermillion Bird Holy Sect. The relationship was so deep that even Apotheosis Bella who was famous for her deep love for Star Cultivation Great Emperor must send them off even under such heavily injured conditions to show how important it was.</p><p>****</p><p>A month later, Apotheon Mu’s group of three returned to the Misty Spring Ocean. When he handed 450 million Immortal Crystals and 87 million Crystal Essences to Tang Xiu, he reported his experience when meeting her as well as Apotheosis Bella’s response and words. Finally, he said, “Master, Apotheosis Bella gave us all these Immortal Crystals and Crystal Essences, but their coffer is also fully emptied. She also left a message to me to be conveyed to you.”</p><p>“What is it?” Even though Tang Xiu had a faint guess what the message was, he still inquired with a complicated expression.</p><p>“The heart that once fell in love in the past is a true love that will never decay nor change for ages to come,” said Apotheon Mu.</p><p>Tang Xiu clenched his fists before he slowly loosened them. After a long while, he sighed and spoke to Apotheon Mu, “From today on, you and Yan’er will be stationed to guard the Repose Cliff. You are not to leave unless it’s absolutely necessary. Further, Seaway Monarch and Zenith Venerable will stay here to protect Misty Spring Island. During your leave, I’ve arranged a peerless great array that surrounds a few hundreds of miles radius around Repose Cliff. The array can hold off the strikes of Supreme experts for at least 15 minutes as long as you control the array yourself. Further, I’ve also arranged a spatial teleportation array that can send anyone to a certain place about tens of thousands of miles away.”</p><p>“Where are you going, Master?” asked Apotheon Mu hurriedly.</p><p>“I’m leaving for the Sacred Dragon Immortal Domain, about 12 regions away from here, to buy a batch of Perfected Golden Immortal gladiators. I’m also taking Auntie Star Tears. They will become an important combat force to rescue your four martial brothers and sisters.”</p><p>“But the Sacred Dragon Immortal Domain is quite far and some regions on the way there are very chaotic,” Apotheon Mu hurriedly said. “Only taking Martial Aunt Star Tears with you, that makes me anxious. Please take both Zenith Venerable and Seaway Monarch with you too.”</p><p>“No.” Tang Xiu shook his head. “There’s no need to take them. But you don’t have to worry! I’ll also take Dragonfly and Battle Feng with me alongside Auntie Star Tears.”</p><p>“I know Battle Peng, but who’s this Dragonfly guy?” Apotheon Mu was confused.</p><p>A smile appeared on the corner of Tang Xiu’s mouth. “Well, he’s a boy I met on the way to the Misty Spring Ocean and also your little Junior Brother. I didn’t expect it myself. It was on a whim that I picked this treasure-like brat.”</p><p>“You mean, Junior Brother Dragonfly is… very special?” asked Apotheon Mu in surprise.</p><p>“Quite special and definitely something you can’t imagine.” Tang Xiu said. “With him around, I’m sure I can reduce a lot of trouble on the way. Well, this place is yours to manage, and rather than waiting for the lucky day to come, I’m leaving today. We’ll definitely come in a few months at the fastest, or half a year at the latest, though we have to put aside our plan to rescue those four for now.”</p><p>“The best chance to rescue them is when we’re well-prepared indeed. I’m sure we still have enough time even if we must delay another half a year.” Apotheon Mu nodded.</p><p>****</p><p>In the vast space of the boundless Immortal World.</p><p>Tang Xiu quietly sat cross-legged in cultivation on the golden barouche pulled by Cloudpiercer beasts. Dragonfly and Battle Peng also sat cross-legged immersed themselves in cultivation at his sides. Only Star Tears donning a black robe and holding her immortal swords calmly gazed around.</p><p>Star Tears couldn’t figure out why Tang Xiu only took the three of them on this trip outside. Based on her observation of Tang Xiu all this while, she always thought that Tang Xiu was someone who was afraid of death, so he spent an enormous number of Immortal Crystals and Crystal Essences to buy a large number of Golden Immortals and 3 Perfected Golden Immortals from the Convict Arena.</p><p>Yet, there was also another particular situation. Her Master rarely conversed with her and seemingly avoided her, if not outright repelling her.</p><p>“Are we near Agaric Castle?” Suddenly, Tang Xiu opened his eyes and asked.</p><p>Star Tears was pulled back from her train of thoughts and nodded. “Yeah, we’re still a few millions of kilometers away from Agaric Castle. We should be there in half an incense time. Do you want to visit Agaric Castle, Your Majesty?”</p><p>“Yeah, I want to visit Agaric Castle indeed,” said Tang Xiu, “There may be an unexpected windfall there.”</p><p>“Do you perhaps want to purchase some toadstool or poisonous mushrooms?” asked Star Tears.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
