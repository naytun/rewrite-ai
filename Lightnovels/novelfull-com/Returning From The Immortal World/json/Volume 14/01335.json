If by chance I can purchase these two poisonous mushrooms, I can refine some poison pills that will greatly help us deal with our safety issues.”</p><p>“You’re also proficient in refining poison pills, Your Majesty?” Star Tears was surprised.</p><p>“Well, I’m naturally proficient in things that can protect my life or even kill enemies, mind you.” Tang Xiu slightly smiled.</p><p>Star Tears couldn’t help but roll her eyes in secret. Despite having a firm mentality, she was still speechless by Tang Xiu because she had never seen someone so afraid of death. No matter what kind of situation, this guy always put his safety as his priority for fear that he would be killed one day due to lacking in life-saving means.</p><p>So much for one who calls himself a Heavenly Emperor, huh? Star Tears finally defined Tang Xiu as such inwardly.</p><p>****</p><p>At Agaric Castle.</p><p>It was city shaped like a mushroom. This city couldn’t be compared with the other large cities Tang Xiu had visited, but countless races lived here, and the number was in the hundreds of millions.</p><p>Cultivators riding their swords or Immortals who expelled out their enormous aura could be seen here and there. Various races and sentient beings with various appearances bustled about using all kinds of means. The more they approached Agaric Castle, the more frequent they ran into cultivators. However, every cultivator who lived in the Immortal World had unique eyesight, and just from the golden barouche rode by Tang Xiu’s group alone was enough to tell them that these four people were very powerful.</p><p>After all, just those Cloudpiercer beasts that radiated a soft white light alone seemed to be top-grade Immortal Beasts.</p><p>Quickly after, Tang Xiu’s group was only 500km away from the Agaric Castle city gate. In order not to attract unneeded attention, the four of them got off the golden barouche and Tang Xiu put away the carriage and the Cloudpiercer beasts into the Heavenly Abode artifact as they then flew to Agaric Castle.</p><p>“How long has it been since I came here last time? Thousands of years ago?”</p><p>Tang Xiu looked around at the small mushroom-like buildings in the surroundings and couldn’t help but lament.</p><p>Thousands of years, huh?</p><p>Star Tears couldn’t help but smack her lips, shooting a contemptuous look at Tang Xiu. She didn’t buy it at all. After all, an Immortal, precisely an ordinary one, could only live for several thousands of years.</p><p>In the city.</p><p>The shout of peddlers crying out their wares continuously filled the atmosphere, and all kinds of shops and stalls tried their best to attract patrons from all walks of life.</p><p>Phantasmagoric House.</p><p>It was a large shop inside Agaric Castle that looked impressive just from its outside appearance alone. The rest of the shops were seen as having a lot of clerks acting like marketers, crying out loud to attract patrons to their shops. But the Phantasmagoric House only had four big men standing outside that gazed at the pedestrians coldly, just like guards on the lookout.</p><p>“This is the place.”</p><p>Tang Xiu used to patronize this place, but there was no Phantasmagoric House back then, which meant this shop was not an old player here. However, being able to occupy such a huge shop in the Agaric Castle displayed that the owner, family, or clan must be quite strong.</p><p>After entering, a huge open space with many poisonous mushrooms that looked to be in the wrong place suddenly presented before their eyes. Judging from their quality, however, all of them were just ordinary poisonous mushrooms. Aside from all these mushrooms, there were also some other products, but the quality was average.</p><p>“Welcome to our emporium, distinguished patrons! May I know what you would like to purchase?” A beautiful lady clerk in white greeted and inquired with a professional smile.</p><p>“I want to buy some poisonous mushrooms, and the grade must be at least Five-colored. If your Phantasmagoric House has them and the price is affordable, I’ll pay for it directly. But I’ll be disappointed if you don’t have any and will leave right away.”</p><p>Five-colored Toadstool? And that was the lowest quality?</p><p>The lady clerk’s expression shifted and she observed Tang Xiu’s group of four a while. Then, she nodded and said, “Then please follow me to the 6th floor. The valuable goods of our Phantasmagoric House are stored on the 6th floor. However, Honorable Patron may have to prepare psychologically since the goods there are very expensive.”</p><p>“It’s your business to set the goods to be expensive or cheap, but it’s their value and worth that matters to me.” Tang Xiu calmly said, “If you do have some great items here, I’ll be happy to buy them even if I must spend more.”</p><p>The sales lady in white slightly smiled and took the four to the 6th floor. A spacious hall suddenly appeared in front of everyone with a total of 108 booths inside, each displaying one item.</p><p>“Hey, Eastberg, I saw these Octagems Golden Lotus Minaret first. I won’t give up on them! Don’t ever think you can use the power of your Vast Martial Sect to provoke me here. Worse comes worst, I’ll just kill you and leave,” a long silver-haired old man with a cane glared at a man surrounded by five others and sharply shouted.</p><p>The leader of the five men, a cruel-looking man with a hooked nose and triangular eyes grimly glared back at the old man and coldly said, “Hmph, you can try. The Vast Martial Sect’s powerhouses will be arriving here before you can kill me. Old bastard, the Octagems Golden Lotus Minaret is an artifact that can only be fully controlled by a Golden Immortal. You’re just a Celestial Immortal, old shit, yet you wanna have it?”</p><p>The old man angrily shouted, “Why can’t I have it, shithead? I can naturally use it when I break through to the Golden Immortal Stage one day, but one can only come across this Octagems Golden Lotus Minaret serendipitously!”</p><p>Eastberg clenched his fists and directly pinched a Message Token to send a message after seeing the vicious look in the old man’s eyes. Afterward, he proudly stated, “You can act arrogant now, but when the experts from my sect come here, you’ll definitely kneel and beg for mercy.”</p><p>The old man’s expression changed and his expression turned hesitant. Then, he turned to the reticent attendant of the shop and said in a deep voice, “You also know the Immortal World’s custom that a treasure that is seen and fancied by many people goes to the highest bidder, right?”</p><p>The shop assistant nodded and said, “That’s right. Would you like it to be tendered?”</p><p>“That’s right. I’d like to have it tendered.” The old man firmly said, “The price of the Octagems Golden Lotus Minaret is 2 million Immortal Crystals. I bid 2.1 million for it.”</p><p>Eastberg shouted angrily, “Hey, old bastard, you dare to show off your wealth to me? You’re really looking to be abused here. I bid 3 million Immortal Crystals for this Octagems Golden Lotus Minaret!”</p><p>The old man slightly frowned and followed coldly. “Four million.”</p><p>Eastberg shouted, “5 million.”</p><p>The old man’s frown went deeper. After a long silence, he slowly said, “5.5 million Immortal Crystals. That’s all I can take out. If you can bid higher, you can have this Octagems Golden Lotus Minaret.”</p><p>Eastberg’s face turned black. Although he was very rich, the elder of his family, who was a senior official of the Vast Martial Sect, usually gave him many Immortal Crystals, but all he had on him now was only 6 million Immortal Crystals. If he were to take out so many Immortal Crystals all of a sudden, he would be dirt poor for the next hundred years.</p><p>However, if he didn’t obtain it, he would lose face in front of this old bastard. He wouldn’t be able to lift his head up high for many years once today’s matter was to be spread out.</p><p>“5.6 million Immortal Crystals!” Eastberg gritted his teeth and shouted sharply.</p><p>The old man looked bitter and shook his head before he turned around to leave.</p><p>“6 million Immortal Crystals.”</p><p>Nearby, Tang Xiu slightly chuckled and immediately went towards them. The old man who was just about to leave suddenly had a change in expression and immediately refrained from leaving, looking at Tang Xiu with a surprised face.</p><p>Tang Xiu glanced at the shop assistant and smilingly said, “Facing such a treasure, the one who bids the highest will get it, isn’t that right?”</p><p>“You’re right.” The shop assistant smiled.</p><p>Tang Xiu then shifted to Eastberg and asked, “You want to continue bidding? If you don’t, then this Octagems Golden Lotus Minaret artifact is mine. If you keep bidding, I’ll continue to increase the bid as well.”</p><p>Eastberg never dreamed that someone would disrupt him halfway. He glared at Tang Xiu fiercely and angrily shouted, “Just from where this dogshit came? Do you even think you’re qualified to compete with this Big Daddy? Are you tired of living already?”</p><p>Slap!</p><p>Tang Xiu moved lightning-fast, slapped his face, and sent him flying tens of meters away before the guy heavily fell on the floor. He then sneered and said, “Daring to act so arrogantly in front of me? You’re the first of those who dare to insult me and have not died yet. Beware.”</p><p>“F*CK! You dare to hit someone from the Vast Martial Sect? You really are tired of living, aren’t you!” The Earth Immortal expert of the Vast Martial Sect angrily roared and attacked, and the other three beside him also unleashed their immortal swords with postures ready to go all out.</p><p>“You know, I didn’t kill you to give face to the owner of this shop.” Tang Xiu sneered. “But since you’re looking for death, then let me fulfill your wish.”</p><p>Just as his voice faded away, a streak of light was shot and instantly hit the four people, directly killing them without them being able to block or evade it.</p><p>The one who took action was Battle Peng.</p><p>The shop assistant wanted to stop him, but he was too late and could only helplessly watch the four people be killed. He hurriedly shouted, “Hey, you’re not allowed to kill anyone in our shop!”</p><p>After Battle Peng killed the four people in a flash, he didn’t stop moving and quickly beheaded Eastberg and punched his body into a pulp. Only then did he look satisfied and said, “My Master already gave you face and only slapped this guy. Yet they insisted on courting their own deaths, so we had no choice but to act accordingly.”</p><p>“You guys…”</p><p>The shop assistant was furious.</p><p>Tang Xiu coldly stared at him and overbearingly said, “What’s wrong? We killed them and that’s it. What’s the big deal? Just some ants and you want to bother about such a trivial thing? Your Phantasmagoric House is running a business here but pokes your nose in others’ business often, you may easily provoke troubles for yourself. You had better shut the hell up and deal with me directly!”</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>A figure flickered and instantly appeared before everyone lightning fast. The figure was a man with a refined and gentle scholarly aura holding a fan and shaking it. He glanced at the four bodies on the floor and said indifferently, “What you just said does have some truth to it, Mister. But the custom of our Phantasmagoric House must never be broken. We have no choice but to meddle in unless you have the strength to shake us off.”</p><p>“I can kill you within 2 breaths. Do you believe it or not?” Battle Peng sneered.</p><p>The middle-aged man was also a Golden Immortal, but his complexion changed when he sensed the aura instantly released by Battle Peng. He lightly smiled and said, “Just one Golden Immortal is perhaps not enough to scare off Phantasmagoric House, mind you.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
