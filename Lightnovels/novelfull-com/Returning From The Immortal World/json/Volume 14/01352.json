He realized that he was not as strong as he thought. Being looked down by old fiend Yi Zun, someone who he once thought as a much weaker person than him, made him ashamed. In nearly an instant, he took a black pill and swallowed it.</p><p>“Then show me what kind of capital you have to back that arrogance.”</p><p>Streaks of dazzling lights suddenly burst out from his immortal sword. The countless sword beams then fused into tens of thousands of sword beams and hacked powerfully toward old fiend Yi Zun. At the same time, his figure split into three, and two of them appeared beside Yi Zun to deliver furious blows.</p><p>“Three-lines Clone Art?”</p><p>Old fiend Yi Zun suddenly turned vigilant. He was very familiar with Venerable East Wu and was naturally aware that this was East Wu’s most powerful move. Therefore, he quickly unleashed a fingernail-sized black skull from his sleeve. In just a flash, its size turned thousands of times bigger and a black fierce beast the size of a cheetah burrowed out of the ear, nose, and throat of the huge skull as they bared its fang and lunged toward Venerable East Wu.</p><p>East Wu’s Innate Natal Immortal weapon that turned into thousands of sword beams was blocked by the black fierce beasts. In but a moment, a sword formation full of evilness formed in the air and burst out three sword beams.</p><p>“It got breached…”</p><p>Venerable East Wu’s complexion changed greatly. He was acutely aware that the three black fierce beasts didn’t form such a sword formation but shot at him in strange trajectories. No matter how hard he tried to block them, one of the black fierce beasts cut off his left hand with the immortal sword and its sharp claws tore his chest.</p><p>Buzz…</p><p>At this time, East Wu felt like his brain went dizzy, while the other black fierce beast seized the moment in an instant and torpedoed his chest with its head.</p><p>Puah…</p><p>In a flash moment, Venerable East Wu was sent flying and smashed heavily on the city wall. A transparent shield then activated from the wall. Though he didn’t cause any damage to the city wall, the enormous impact made his injury become a bit more serious.</p><p>However, at this moment, although old fiend Yi Zun’s injury was lighter than East Wu, the Three-lines Clone Art’s furious strikes still made him spit out blood.</p><p>“Who are you, exactly?” After leaning against the city wall and then being able to stand firm, Venerable East Wu shouted fiercely.</p><p>Old fiend Yi Zun raised his hand to wipe the blood from the corner of his mouth and sneeringly smiled. “You do have some ability since you can hurt me. Then let me enlighten you before you die. I’m Saurian Demon Lord. I’ve been hiding in the Immortal Lyceum for thousands of years to avoid the pursuit of a powerful enemy. I wouldn’t have exposed my identity if it wasn’t for my son’s death. But still, it’s worth celebrating for you to die in my hands, Venerable East Wu.”</p><p>“You’re unexpectedly that demonic fiend?” Venerable East Mu shouted incredulously, “You provoked a Supreme powerhouse a few thousands of years ago and got miserably chased down. I never thought that Senescent Fiend Yi Zun turns out to be your disguise and you unexpectedly have been hiding in the Immortal Lyceum. No wonder you hid your cultivation and identity all this time. But I guarantee you will pay a grievous price if you want to kill me.”</p><p>Whoosh, whoosh…</p><p>Two figures moved like lightning bolts and appeared in front of old fiend Yi Zun. Two high-grade Praecantator weapons instantly barraged him as another lightning-fast moving figure appeared in front of Yi Zun, sending fearsomely powerful punches to him. The humongous impact force even made Yi Zun miserably shriek.</p><p>“He got a very tough physique.”</p><p>Tang Xiu transmitted his order to Star Tears and Sablefiend Scorpio. At the moment when old fiend Yi Zun was beaten backward, the punch barrage that hit him was getting more violent. At the same time, Tang Xiu also unleashed his Devour supernatural ability to avoid the old fiend flying too fast.</p><p>“What’s going on?”</p><p>Even in his wildest dream, Senescent Fiend Yi Zun never thought that some powerhouses would come when he was confident and ready to kill Venerable East Wu. Further, these three powerhouses were at least Perfected Golden Immortals. The sudden strikes nearly made him a ghost, but an even more ruthless powerful enemy behind him rendered him unable to hold his ground firmly. The punch’s might that hit him had already exceeded his endurance and the pain made him scream unceasingly. Even his scale armor shattered by his barrage.</p><p>“DIE AND GO TO HELL!”</p><p>Tang Xiu unleashed his divine sword and directly impaled Yi Zun’s body at a very close distance, then he used his Primal Chaos force to destroy his internal organs. At the same time, he also cast his Fusion supernatural ability and began to dissolve the man’s Immortal Soul with irresistible force, transforming it into pure energy and then integrated into his body to increase his own cultivation.</p><p>“Explode!”</p><p>Tang Xiu madly circulated his Primal Chaos force into his fist and then punched Yi Zun’s body. The violent blow struck powerfully and directly pierced through the old fiend’s body, sending him flying thousands of meters backward before he exploded in mid-air.</p><p>“This energy… is very pure.”</p><p>Tang Xiu recalled the moment of killing a Supreme in the Heavenly Mountain last time. He devoured and fused someone’s immortal soul and strength, making his strength to soar by leaps and bounds. This time, he was thankful that the energy that had been refined by old fiend Yi Zun was much purer and more enormous.</p><p>Prior to this, he likely had yet to understand how heaven-defying the Devour and Fusion supernatural abilities were. He would be an idiot if he couldn’t at least figure them out now. The mechanism was devouring others’ Immortal Souls and, after refining them, then fusing would turn it into his own power. He finally figured out some of the mysteries of the Heavenly Art of Cosmic Genesis now.</p><p>Heavenly Art of Cosmic Genesis seems to not only be a cultivation technique to improve his physical body and strength, but it can also be used to kill strong enemies and absorb their quintessence and strongest source of strength. Last time, he integrated the Immortal Soul’s energy of a Perfected Golden Immortal, which caused his cultivation to greatly increase, at least comparable to 100 years of cultivation. But this time, it increased much more. He estimated that he had gained 200 years of cultivation worth of energy.</p><p>Killing and then using Devour and Fusion!</p><p>Tang Xiu took a deep breath. After fully realizing the fact that Heavenly Art of Cosmic Genesis was against the natural order, his eyes gleamed. Now he had greater confidence that he could rapidly improve his cultivation. His revenge now didn’t seem so in the distant future.</p><p>Star Tears and Sablefiend Scorpio’s expressions changed after witnessing how easy it was for Tang Xiu to kill old fiend Yi Zun. They had seen Tang Xiu killing a Perfected Golden Immortal once, but the enemy at the time was looking down on Tang Xiu and taking him lightly. It could be said that what happened then involved too much luck.</p><p>But this time, although Tang Xiu applied a surprise attack and used both of their strikes as a starting point, his violent power, as well the means he used to strike that final blow, made the two finally realize that Tang Xiu’s might was already comparable to a Perfected Golden Immortal.</p><p>Nearby, Venerable East Wu dumbly looked at the three people. But he then immediately relaxed, especially after his vision landed on Tang Xiu. Outsiders may not know the identities of Tang Xiu, Star Tears, and Sablefiend Scorpio, but he knew a few things about them. After all, the scene in the Heavenly Mountain when they teamed up to kill the enemy was still vivid in his mind.</p><p>He was perfectly aware that had it not been for these three people, the result of him fighting Senescent Fiend Yi Zun would have ended up with him being killed ruthlessly and that old fiend gravely injured. It could be said that these three people were his life-saving benefactors.</p><p>“Thank you for this life-saving grace, Heavenly Emperor.”</p><p>Venerable East Wu came to Tang Xiu’s group and respectfully cupped his fists.</p><p>Tang Xiu slightly smiled in response and waved his hand. “It was just by chance that we met here, so we just extended our hands. Besides, Apotheosis Bella and I are truly on the same side. You’re her subordinate. There’s something I’d like to say to you, though whether Venerable East Wu would like to hear it is yours to choose.”</p><p>“Please grant me your instructions, Heavenly Emperor. I’m all ears,” said Venerable East Wu hurriedly.</p><p>“You’re the City Lord of Renault City with which comes the responsibility that you must shelter everyone here.” Tang Xiu started to speak. “You may have some friendship with Senescent Fiend Yi Zun, but you shouldn’t have dispatched your men to catch the four people who killed his only son. Your Renault City has its own rules. As long as these people are not Immortal Lyceum’s enemies and inside the city under Immortal Lyceum, they are legitimate people of Immortal Lyceum, and some things are bound not to be overstepped. You may be the one who devised these rules, but one thing you must remember is not to cross the bottom line easily.”</p><p>Venerable East Wu slightly frowned and asked, “I understand what you mean, Heavenly Emperor. But that sounds like making a fuss over trivial matters, no? After all, those four weak…”</p><p>Tang Xiu waved his hand again to interrupt him and continued, “It’s all about security sense, so everyone in the Immortal Lyceum’s territory, either they are just ordinary mortals or cultivators are just the same. Do not ever distinguish people with how strong and weak they are, what you must do is to differentiate whether they are enemies or our own people. Only when you provide them enough security will they be able to rely on you and support you. Besides, those four may be very weak in your eyes, but if they keep advancing in their cultivation in the future, they will really group up and become the strength that supports the Immortal Lyceum as well.”</p><p>As he spoke up to this point, Tang Xiu took a deep breath before he glanced over at the thousands of Immortal soldiers. Then, he added, “Treat your own people right and unite with them as one and band together like strands of rope. Even an ordinary person may affect the result of a battle at certain special moments. I once witnessed a fight between two Perfected Golden Immortals, but at the end of their fight, these two Perfected Golden Immortals were all gravely injured and no longer had any ability to strike. What if a Foundation Establishment cultivator passed by at such a moment? I don’t think I need to say more about this, do I?”</p><p>Venerable East was as though getting struck by lightning, and his whole being was drowning into the meanings in Tang Xiu’s words.</p><p>Unity and banding together just like strands of rope? Say, something like a sense of belonging?</p><p>These seemingly ordinary words birthed a profound change in his state of mind, causing him to slowly raise his head to look at the vast sky of the universe.</p><p>“All living things in the world have strengths and shortcomings.</p><p>“A grain of sand may look minuscule, but hundreds of millions of grains of sand can form a vast mountain.</p><p>“A drop of water may look insignificant, but hundreds of millions of them can form a vast ocean.</p><p>“One person is only a single number, but hundreds of millions of people can form fearsome legions.</p><p>“When many little things assemble and add up to something great, it may even shake the sun and moon, and quake the very life and livelihood.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
