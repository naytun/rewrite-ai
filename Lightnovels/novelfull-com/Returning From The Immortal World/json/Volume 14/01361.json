Both of them didn’t retract their vision from outside even though the battle was over.</p><p>“It’s quite unexpected. I never thought Dao Master Qing Feng would have such connections. Even those two guys, Nine Nether and Netherworld, didn’t hesitate to stand up for him and offend the Myriad Sword Sect. Seems like my goodwill went for nothing,” said Tang Xiu with a pale smile.</p><p>“Well, who in the Immortal World doesn’t have a few real friends after living for several thousands of years?” commented Apotheosis Bella with a smile. “It’s just that I didn’t expect that even the fiend Undemonized Sovereign Mo turned out to be Qing Feng’s life-and-death friend. Seems like the trip to the Secret Palace will be full of brutal fights beyond what I’ve expected.”</p><p>A complicated look flashed in Tang Xiu’s eyes. What Apotheosis Bella said touched the deep pain in his heart. He once thought that he also had several friends—life-and-death friends. Yet, in the end, those he thought as his best friends were the very ones who made him gravely injured.</p><p>“I feel a bit regretful all of a sudden,” said Tang Xiu suddenly.</p><p>“Huh?” Apotheosis Bella turned her head and her beautiful face looked bewildered, asking, “What are you regretting, exactly?”</p><p>“I regret bringing a few Perfected Golden Immortals with me,” said Tang Xiu. “Else, I’d have been able to hunt more happily in the Secret Palace later.”</p><p>“Xiu, I don’t want you to court danger and be in danger before you’re strong enough, got it?” Apotheosis Bella smiled wryly. “In particular, I never want to see you end up miserable being hunted down by powerful enemies. I still remember the words you told me back then, that a man’s revenge is never too late even if you wait for 10 years or more since you will get the chance to get revenge as long as you’re alive. We’ll make our enemies pay a painful price when we’ve become stronger. That’s for sure.”</p><p>Tang Xiu took a deep breath to suppress the killing intent boiling inside him. He slowly nodded and said, “No worries! I’m not a reckless person. I won’t easily clash with them if I don’t have full assurance. Besides, my main purpose in going to the Secret Mansion is to get cultivation resources and massive wealth, to begin with.”</p><p>Time passed by quickly, and in an instant, it was time for the Secret Palace to open. As the glowing red blob from the eastern horizon of the Boundless Mountain Range raised, myriad streaks of light suddenly dyed the entire vault of heaven scarlet. A terrifying pressure suddenly descended from the sky and fell directly into the undulating mountain range.</p><p>WOOOAH…</p><p>Innumerable screams came from the vast mountain range. Those Immortal World’s powerhouses who had been hiding in the Boundless Mountain Range in order to be the first to enter the Secret Palace when it opened. The number of Golden Immortals was just enormous, and some Perfected Golden Immortals were even among them.</p><p>However, that terrifying pressure was just too horrible. Even among Perfected Golden Immortal powerhouses, only five figures were able to run away in distress. Those with keen eyes could see that they had been seriously injured, increasing the risk and danger they would face when they entered the Secret Palace.</p><p>At this moment, Tang Xiu summoned Sablefiend Scorpio from the Heavenly Abode artifact. He ignored the confused Star Luminous and Star Peng and shifted his vision to the Boundless Mountain Range, saying slowly, “He’s truly worthy as the strongest expert in the Immortal World 80,000 years ago. Just the immortal beams that opened the Secret Palace alone already have such great power. It’s highly likely the situation inside the Secret Palace itself is much more dangerous.”</p><p>“But we still must strive hard even if it’s ridden with dangers,” said Star Tears.</p><p>Tang Xiu nodded and said, “If anything, you may not be able to stay in the Heavenly Abode artifact before entering the Secret Palace. But you should be able to return to the Heavenly Abode after we’re inside. I hope we can have a great harvest.”</p><p>As of now, under the terrifying pressure, a rainbow gradually appeared and a 50 km wide square entrance fully appeared and instantly radiated a soft white light.</p><p>“The Secret Palace has opened! Let’s go!”</p><p>A group of figures suddenly rushed towards the 50km square entrance lightning-fast with tens of thousands of other people. Nearly all the groups were headed by Perfected Golden Immortals as all of them disappeared into the white light.</p><p>It was a scene Tang Xiu had never seen before. While looking at the millions of Golden Immortals and Perfected Golden Immortals lunging into the Secret Palace’s entrance, he took a deep breath and said in a deep voice, “Let’s enter the Secret Palace’s entrance. I suspect there’s a teleportation array there, so keep in mind that if we get separated by that teleportation array after we enter it, remember to inform the rest using your Message Token and immediately gather with the nearest one among us. Do not try to show off your ability there, and do call any of us at once should you run into dangers.”</p><p>“Thank you, Great Tang Heavenly Emperor.” The duo cupped their fists and gratefully said.</p><p>Tang Xiu took a deep breath, flew up, and bolted towards the entrance.</p><p>Buzz…</p><p>The moment Tang Xiu’s figure was submerged in the white light, enormous energy instantly wrapped him up. The earth and sky felt like spinning around and, after Tang Xiu’s sight returned, he found himself in an undulating mountain range. The mountains here towered into the clouds, at least thousands of meters high, while all the unrecognized trees with roots on the ground also similarly reached the sky. Nearly all of them were thousands of meters high, and some of them even reached tens of thousands of meters. Being here made anyone feel like they suddenly turned into a drop of water in the ocean.</p><p>Suddenly, a vague sensation came from Tang Xiu’s left side. In nearly a flash, Tang Xiu wore an Invisibility Charm and restrained his aura as he silently blended into the bush ten meters high.</p><p>“This is Origin Yang Fruit?”</p><p>After calming himself, Tang Xiu glanced around, and what surprised him was the nine dazzling golden fruits at the distance several meters away. It took him only a glance to determine that it was Origin Yang Fruit, a spirit fruit that could increase one’s cultivation and quintessence energy.</p><p>“As expected, treasures are just everywhere in the Secret Palace. After 80,000 years passed, any spirit herbs here will be extraordinary.” Tang Xiu sighed inwardly.</p><p>15 minutes later, Tang Xiu sensed a very vague aura. As it became clearer, a golden-robed and long-haired burly man was getting closer and closer until Tang Xiu was able to see his face clearly.</p><p>It was a Golden Immortal.</p><p>Tang Xiu ruminated for a second and decided not to harm this person, but waited quietly for this guy to pass by. Then, he silently picked the nine Origin Yan Fruits and then stuffed them into his ring. Afterward, he took out a Message Token to message the other four.</p><p>Quickly, Tang Xiu received a reply from the other four. After figuring out the location where they had been teleported, he suddenly frowned since he found that the distance between him and Sablefiend Scorpio was just a few thousands of kilometers away. They could meet quickly if they were to fly straight and openly. However, they needed to avoid other people while also being alert to potential crises in this Secret House, so they wouldn’t be able to meet shortly.</p><p>Quickly after, while keeping his vigilance, Tang Xiu met two other Golden Immortals. He chose not to disturb them since he couldn’t recognize their identities. He could tell that these two people were guarding against each other and then separated in two directions. Only then did Tang Xiu continue on his route.</p><p>Half a day passed and Tang Xiu had traveled hundreds of thousands of kilometers. He encountered several waves of Immortals on the way, but he didn’t meet any of them, nor did he alarm them, he only silently halted his pace and hid nearby.</p><p>“That’s…”</p><p>Tang Xiu saw two sides fighting over a stalk of herbs called Solitary Thread Herb—a very rare herb that could heal one’s Immortal Soul and also had significant effects on Perfected Golden Immortal.</p><p>“A late-stage Golden Immortal against an early-stage Perfected Golden Immortal. The former is somewhat interesting since he can fight equally with the later. It seems like his identity is extraordinary. Unfortunately, he’s wearing a mask artifact that blocks any spiritual sense, so I can’t see his true face.</p><p>“Well, might as well wait for both of them to get mutually wounded and be the third party who grabs the harvest without much effort. I can’t easily fight with anyone here. Else the risks will increase once I get injured.”</p><p>Tang Xiu thought inwardly while watching two people fight more fiercely. When that late-stage Golden Immortal was hit hard and seriously injured by that Perfected Golden Immortal and was ready to give up the Solitary Thread Herb, his complexion slightly changed since two sword beasts unexpectedly flashed from the grove nearby. The big tree towering to the sky was unscathed, but that Golden Immortal was hit by the two sword beams, causing his Immortal Soul to be instantly obliterated.</p><p>“GET OUT!”</p><p>The Perfected Golden Immortal’s expression changed and he instantly lunged towards the Solitary Thread Herb, uprooted it in the blink of an eye, and quickly stuffed it into his interspatial ring.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>Two figures flickered and appeared in front of him lightning-fast. One of them, a white-haired old man in a brown robe on the left, hideously smiled. “Hand over that Solitary Thread Herb and I’ll spare your life. Else, you’ll end up just like that one!”</p><p>That Perfected Golden Immortal sneered at his demand and said in a deep voice, “I may not be able to fight both of you even if I go all out. But do you dare to openly chase me if I want to flee? The Secret Palace is now ridden with crises, just a slight misfortune is enough to either encounter some other powerhouses or even touch some restriction arrays here. Feel free to chase me if you think the Solitary Thread Herb is worth risking your life.”</p><p>Having said that, his figure had already dashed away to the distance in a flash. He even went so far so as to burst out a huge aura.</p><p>“DAMMIT!”</p><p>The two Perfected Golden Immortals’ expressions enormously changed and they could only watch that fella flee at breakneck speed with furious faces. They tried to pursue him for several thousands of kilometers before directly giving up. They indeed didn’t dare to hunt down the enemy in the crisis-ridden Secret Palace. Losing their lives just for one Solitary Thread Herb was not worth it.</p><p>Tang Xiu kept tracking these people since the Perfected Golden Immortal who got the Solitary Thread Herb fled to the direction he was heading to. Hence, he made a short detour when the two Perfected Golden Immortal halted their pace and then tailed the other one all the way.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
