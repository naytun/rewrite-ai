Further, I owe you a favor as well. Come to the Great Tang Empire if you have any needs in the future.”</p><p>With that said, Tang Xiu took out all his Immortal Stones, Immortal Crystals, and Crystal Essences and handed them to the beautiful Manager of the Convict Arena, saying, “6 Perfected Golden Immortals, including that Sablefiend Scorpio. I’ve counted the total sum I have which is 84.6 million Crystal Essences. Even though I borrowed 20 million Crystal Essences, I still have to fork out 60 million Crystal Essences.”</p><p>A surprised look glittered in the woman’s eyes as she nodded and slowly said, “You can save the 600,000 Crystal Essences.”</p><p>Having said that, she took out 6 Soul Plates, handed them to Tang Xiu, and personally opened the six cells to unchain each of the Perfected Golden Immortals chained inside.</p><p>“Sablefiend Scorpio, Celestial Litho Monstrum, Flaming Demon Feline, Golden-eyed Great Peng, Lupus Chimaera Monstrum, and Nethersea Whale King, the six of you are slaves of Great Tang Heavenly Emperor starting today. I’ve handed over your Soul Plates to him, so your lives are now in his hands,” the beautiful woman glanced at the six people and said in a deep voice.</p><p>The six deathmatch fighters that had gone through 300 battles in the arena stared fixedly at Tang Xiu. Their whole bodies were full of death energy and unruliness was evident in their expressions. Even though Tang Xiu controlled their lives, he bought them at such a high price, so they were not worried that Tang Xiu would kill them and very likely only wanted them to fully serve him.</p><p>After refining the six Soul Plates and completely controlling their lives, Tang Xiu then lightly stated, “My commands will take priority over anything else including your lives in the future. Certainly, I won’t mind punishing one of you as a warning for the rest, so which one of you wants to try to disobey my will first?”</p><p>Killing one to warn the rest?</p><p>The six Perfected Golden Immortal deathmatch gladiators suddenly had a change in complexion. Their unruly expressions slightly changed. None of them wanted to die, let alone become such a chicken on the chopping block.</p><p>“We’re leaving, Old Sycamore.”</p><p>Tang Xiu nodded at the beautiful woman and turned to outside.</p><p>Old Sycamore didn’t reply, nor did he even greet the woman. He just walked outside beside Tang Xiu. When they came to the gate, he asked, “Great Tang Heavenly Emperor, where shall we go next?”</p><p>Tang Xiu’s lips wriggled a few times. As Battle Peng handed him 10 Immortal Crystals, Tang Xiu received them and handed it to Old Sycamore. “It’s a reward for you. Fate will make us meet again in the future.”</p><p>Having said that, he led the group towards the distance.</p><p>10 Immortal Crystals?</p><p>Old Sycamore stared blankly at the 10 Immortal Crystals in his hand. Some memories that had been sealed in his heart suddenly gushed out like a flood destroying a dam.</p><p>It was thousands of years ago. He was just a boy less than 9 years old, wandering the streets with his younger brother to beg around, hoping to get some alms and leftovers. They were driven out, beaten, and abused like livestock that even slave traders were unwilling to capture.</p><p>However, on that fateful day, month, and year, the brothers stole 2 expensive pieces of clothing but were discovered by its owner and nearly killed. At that moment, he vowed that he’d kill the man who beat him if he lived. He also vowed to kill the man who had abused the brothers. At that time, he had even made plans to go all out to get some money to buy a cultivation art manual and become a powerful cultivator.</p><p>And at that moment, a great figure suddenly blocked the sun for the brothers.</p><p>But his younger brother knelt behind that great figure who had rescued them, shouting that he wanted to acknowledge him as Master. In his eyes at the time, it was just a dream—something people like them should not dare to imagine.</p><p>But eventually, that man halted his pace and asked his brother a few questions before he agreed to accept him as his disciple, though he must take his brother away.</p><p>“How long are we leaving for, exactly?”</p><p>It was the only question he asked at the time, and the answer he got was: thousands of years at the earliest and eternity at the longest.</p><p>He didn’t leave, however. He couldn’t wait for a thousand years, nor did he want to regret it for eternity. But in the end, his brother was taken away by that great figure, whereas he stayed.</p><p>Old Sycamore clearly remembered that before his brother was taken away, that great figure handed him 10 Immortal Crystals and said something he never forgot for the rest of his life:</p><p>“It’s a reward for you. Fate will make us meet again in the future.”</p><p>Now the scenes of the past unfolded yet again.</p><p>Old Sycamore’s bleeding heart opened up. That majestic and unparalleled figure looked so familiar and yet so… real.</p><p>“A-are you him?!”</p><p>Old Sycamore chased ahead a few steps forward with a face full of excitement as he shouted aloud.</p><p>After he shouted this sentence, however, disappointment from deep within his soul gushed forth and filled his whole heart, as though his whole being had fallen into a glacier hole. He knew that he had lost his reason for a moment. Because that man… just like his brother, was already… dead.</p><p>Some kilometers away, Tang Xiu’s pace came to a halt as he slowly turned around. Watching the ghastly pale-looking Old Sycamore, his lips squirmed a few times, and finally, he transmitted his voice he didn’t plan to speak out to Old Sycamore’s ears.</p><p>“I’m really sorry.”</p><p>Having said that, Tang Xiu took everyone to speed up and disappeared from Old Sycamore’s sight.</p><p>Sorry? You’re saying sorry?</p><p>Old Sycamore’s pupils shrunk all of a sudden and incredulity burst in his eyes. His figure flickered and became hazy as he disappeared out of thin air under countless people’s attention.</p><p>Hundreds of thousands of miles away.</p><p>Old Sycamore appeared atop a mountain peak, looking at the empty scene around him, yet his heart was shivering and wildly throbbing.</p><p>People said that the older and more experienced a person was, the wiser and more sophisticated his or her mind became.</p><p>He had lived for thousands of years and had become extremely wise and sophisticated. Just that “Sorry” word and the line “I’m sorry” that man spoke was enough to shock him to the core.</p><p>His younger brother was long dead. Although that man did go on a rampage for the crazy slaughter to annihilate the culprits. However, of all people in this world, he was indeed the only one who owed him that one sentence—those three words.</p><p>In this world, that man was the only person who would ever say those three words to him.</p><p>Old Sycamore clenched his fists, eyes flashing with madness as he roared loudly, “I will find you since I know that you’re still alive. This Old Sycamore originally thought to have no longer any concern in this life, yet it turns out that you’re still around!”</p><p>That’s right. Even though he didn’t leave with Tang Xiu back then, he, like his younger brother, had regarded that majestic figure as his real family member. That man had treated both of them very well. What’s more, it was because those 10 Immortal Crystals that man gave him that he was able to buy a cultivation manual, though it was a common one. It was because of those 10 Immortal Crystals that he could buy those elixirs even though they were the lowest grade pills.</p><p>However, it was the very cause of him becoming stronger and granted him the ability to kill all the enemies who had bullied the brothers.</p><p>Thousands of years ago, he was able to become an Immortal due to his younger brother sending him some elixirs that allowed him to ascend.</p><p>Thousands of years ago, he was able to become an Earth Immortal due to the cultivation resources his younger brother sent that allowed him to break through successfully.</p><p>It was also his younger brother who sent him Immortal elixirs and nectars that made him able to advance to the Celestial Immortal Stage thousands of years ago.</p><p>That younger brother of his also sent a lot of elixirs, Immortal Crystals, and Crystal Essences that made his cultivation continue to improve. Under the support of huge resources, he finally broke through to the Profound Immortal Stage and Golden Immortal Stage.</p><p>He had now become a Perfected Golden Immortal. Even though only 3 people knew that he had become a Perfected Golden Immortal in the entire Immortal World, it was a fact that he had truly become a genuine powerhouse in the eyes of countless walks of life.</p><p>He had disappeared time and again during the past hundreds of years whenever the Vermillion Bird Holy Sect was besieged by powerful enemies, only to come back with a body full of scars every time.</p><p>Nobody knew that he was there to pay that debt of… gratitude. It was to repay the debt of gratitude both for him and his younger brother.</p><p>“Huh?”</p><p>Old Sycamore’s complexion suddenly changed as his keen sense caught several extremely faint fluctuation auras in the air. A fierce and cold light suddenly burst in his eyes. Waving the black gourd in his hand, his aura raged and suddenly blasted toward the few faint waves.</p><p>“GET THE HELL OUT!”</p><p>At the same time, the black tide frantically flooded out of his black gourd as though billowing black river in the void and instantly submerged the place where those faint fluctuating auras originated.</p><p>“Mercy! We’re on the same side!”</p><p>Three figures in black robes appeared out of the blue and stared at the black flood terror with horrified expressions.</p><p>“The Convict Arena’s Ears, huh? It seems you’re here to investigate his identity!” Old Sycamore’s eyes flashed with coldness. His immortal sword suddenly split into seven in an instant and shredded the three people after they were trapped in the black tide and directly annihilated their Immortal souls.</p><p>Immediately after, he put away the black gourd and completely erased all the traces left in this place before disappearing.</p><p>****</p><p>Half a month later.</p><p>Tang Xiu brought Battle Peng, Star Tears, Dragonfly, and the six Perfected Golden Immortals he just purchased back to Agaric Castle. Tang Xiu was completely broke today without even a piece of Immortal Stone left.</p><p>Buzz…</p><p>He pinched the Message Token and, half an hour later, the old man who sold the information to Tang Xiu appeared in front of him.</p><p>“Have you obtained the Soul Pursuit Token, Senior?” the old man looked excited and hurriedly asked as he looked at Tang Xiu.</p><p>“No, I haven’t gone to the Vast Martial Sect yet.” Tang Xiu shook his head and slowly said, “I went to find some people to help me so as not to let anything else slip away. Anyway, let’s head there now! Even if the Vast Martial Sect has a Perfected Golden Immortal ancestor, they won’t be able to keep the token this time. And you, take us to the Vast Martial Sect.”</p><p>The old man looked horrified and hurriedly said, “Senior, even if you have invited some helpers and you also have Perfected Golden Immortals at your side, it’s just impossible to obtain the Soul Pursuit Token. If they just go crazy and activate the token to contact Battlesoul Supreme, we’re all gonna die!”</p><p>“No worries!” Tang Xiu sneered. “I’d never take a risk without complete preparation. As long as your info is correct, the Soul Pursuit Token will definitely be mine.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
