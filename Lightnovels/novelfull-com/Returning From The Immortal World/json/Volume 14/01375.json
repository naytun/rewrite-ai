Do you now have a chance to advance to the Supremacy Stage?”</p><p>“I’m sure I can break through to the Supremacy Stage within a century,” replied Star Tears with a smile.</p><p>“If that’s the case, then you’re to take these two little guys back!” Tang Xiu nodded happily. “It won’t be easy for them to return to the Vermillion Bird Holy Sect safely given their present strength.”</p><p>Star Tears hesitated for a while and said, “But I’d like to stay here to cultivate for a century since I plan to go back after breaking through to the Supremacy Stage.”</p><p>After contemplating for a while, Tang Xiu took 2 objects out of his interspatial right and handed them to Star Tears. “Take these two things and you may be able to advance to the Supremacy Stage in less than a century. You can stay here since you chose so. Also, the Secret Palace hoards a lot of wealth, so take it with you when you come back too.”</p><p>Star Tears nodded slowly. But when she saw the two objects, her pupils contracted and she looked ecstatic. “Earth Core and Five-colored Dragon Pearl? These two objects are all treasures and they are very important for me now! With them, I can definitely break through to the Supremacy Stage in a few decades at most.”</p><p>Tang Xiu just smiled lightly in response and then shifted to Sablefiend Scorpio. “Well, the Secret Palace already has a Master now, so let’s head out first!”</p><p>Sablefiend Scorpio pondered for a moment and asked, “Master, you and Venerable Star Tears are…”</p><p>“It’s not yet the time for you to know that.” Tang Xiu shook his head. “Wait until I break through to the Supremacy Stage and I’ll naturally tell you.”</p><p>Sablefiend Scorpio nodded silently and no longer asked.</p><p>On the contrary, Star Luminous, who knew the true identity of Star Tears, wasn’t able to suppress his excitement. Originally, he thought that his Great Grand Martial Aunt Star Tears had already passed away in some corners of the Immortal World long ago. During this trip to the Secret Palace, he and Star Peng were the only people from their Vermillion Bird Holy Sect. He never thought that he would run into their Great Grand Martial Aunt here. Furthermore, she was the person who obtained the inheritance of the Drunken Immortal Supreme.</p><p>“The heavens have blessed the Vermillion Bird Holy Sect!”</p><p>Star Luminous took a deep breath and looked at Tang Xiu and observed him quietly for some time, then he inquired, “Great Grand Martial Aunt, who is he, exactly?”</p><p>“You don’t need to know for now.” Star Tears shook her head. “The only thing you need to know is that you must be respectful whenever you see him in the future.”</p><p>“About this… understood.”</p><p>Despite a bit unwilling, Star Luminous still nodded and complied.</p><p>After some time, Star Tears sent Tang Xiu and Sablefiend Scorpio off to the outside. When the two of them appeared in the forested mountain range some million kilometers away from the Secret Palace, they turned into an azure smoke and flew away without slightest delay and headed towards the nearest spatial teleportation array.</p><p>Both of them had obtained a lot of treasures during the trip to the Secret Palace. Star Tears, especially. She collected a massive number of immortal artifacts, Immortal Crystals, and Crystal Essences from various areas in the Secret Palace and handed them to Tang Xiu before they left. The amount was sufficient for the Great Tang Empire to cover their overhead cost for several centuries.</p><p>A few months passed by.</p><p>Tang Xiu and Sablefiend Scorpio arrived in the Great Peng Immortal Domain and stayed in its main city, the Wind Reticulum City. After inquiring some news, it was finally determined that the struggle for the Secret Palace had fully come to an end, though no one knew the person who finally inherited the Drunken Immoral Supreme’s inheritance was.</p><p>Further, some news also said that the Inner Pill Sect and the Everlasting Palace suffered enormous losses during the trip to the Secret Palace. The Inner Pill Sect lost more than a dozen Perfected Golden Immortals and more than 100 Golden Immortals. The Everlasting Palace was even worse with over a dozen Perfected Golden Immortals dead along with nearly 200 Golden Immortals.</p><p>However, these two powerful sects were still barely able to bear these losses. On the contrary, the Sect Master of Myriad Swords Sect was said to be so furious that he destroyed his palace residence, the impact causing thousands of palace servants.</p><p>This Sect fully lost their entire 100,000 Golden Immortals and 46 Perfected Golden Immortals. Most importantly, this sect’s peerless genius, Heroic Sword Venerable, also died in the Secret Palace. It must be noted that Heroic Sword Venerable was the son of the Myriad Swords Sect’s Sect Master who had a 90% chance to be his successor.</p><p>“Dao Master Qing Feng from the Pristine Immortal Confucian Sect is being hunted down by the Myriad Swords Sect’s powerhouses. Undemonized Sovereign Mo has been hit hard, and whether he’s still alive or has died is unknown.”</p><p>It was the other news that was obtained by Tang Xiu and Sablefiend Scorpio.</p><p>In a flash, Tang Xiu made up his mind to leave for the neighboring region, the Hundred Sightless Immortal Domain, to rescue Dao Master Qing Feng. However, there were only two of them and they couldn’t take any rash actions for this rescue mission given their strength. Hence, they needed accurate intel as a support to save these men safely and then escape immediately.</p><p>The Hundred Sightless Immortal Domain.</p><p>In a barren rocky area, Dao Master Qing Feng anxiously looked at the fainted Undemonized Sovereign Mo in his arms. He flew extremely fast, but the four Perfected Golden Immortals were right on his heels, followed by tens of Golden Immortals. The more he saw them, the more helpless and powerless he felt.</p><p>Cough, cough…</p><p>During the escape, Undemonized Sovereign Mo finally sobered up faintly. He looked at the anxious-looking Dao Master Qing Feng who was fleeing quickly. A bitter smile appeared on his face and he said, “You haven’t shaken off those Myriad Swords Sect’s bastards?”</p><p>“Not yet.” Dao Master Qing Feng forced a smile. “They are lunatics and seemingly won’t ever let us off without killing us first.”</p><p>Sovereign Mo swallowed a Purple Scent Pill and adjusted his breathing for some time. He then sighed. “Haih, the Myriad Swords Sect was struck with huge losses during the trip to the Secret Palace, likely sapping nearly 50% of their power. They are venting their anger on us now.”</p><p>“Hmph.” Dao Master Qing Feng sneered. “Let them come if they want to vent on us. The more their people die, the happier I’ll be.”</p><p>“Hehe, that’s so unlike you.” Sovereign Mo chuckled and said, “You were always merciful in the past just like those bald old monkeys from the Buddhist Realm. How come you have such a unique quirk now?”</p><p>“Meh, the Myriad Swords Sect is just a bunch of despicable assholes,” replied Dao Master Qing Feng with a chuckle. “The more they die, the fewer people that will be bullied and killed in the future. Being kind to this sect means being cruel to others. I wish all of them to be fully annihilated!”</p><p>“Bwahaha…” Sovereign Mo burst into laughter and said, “I used to think you were very old school, Qing Feng. I didn’t expect you to be so temperamental this time. Anyways, as long as we can escape this time, I’ll definitely make the Myriad Swords Sect pay a painful price!”</p><p>“No, don’t act reckless and mess up now, Undemonized Mo!” Dao Master Qing Feng hurriedly blurted. “The Myriad Swords Sect may have suffered huge losses this time, but a lean camel is still bigger than a horse. That’s right. Junior Brother Dao Master Guai has messaged me, so we can’t act recklessly for now. We won’t end up great if we get caught by this sect’s powerhouses.”</p><p>“I know that. Offending the Myriad Swords Sect is equivalent to provoking the Everlasting Palace.” Undemonized Sovereign Mo sneered. “In any case, I have a hunch that some people have specifically targeted the people of Inner Pill Sect and Everlasting Palace in the Secret Palace and they should be the ones who killed them.”</p><p>“You’re not the only one who thought so.” Dao Master Qing Feng nodded. “This time, the Inner Pill Sect and the Everlasting Palace were hit hard and suffered enormous losses, worse than any other sect.”</p><p>Undemonized Sovereign Mo’s expression shifted and he said, “Do you think they are from the Vermillion Bird Holy Sect? Those two sects have been harassing and bullying this sect all these years. Only those from this sect would specifically target and strike these two sects during the opening of the Secret Palace. This sect still has the capability to inflict such serious damage to those two sects.”</p><p>Dao Master Qing Feng shook his head. “That’s unlikely. The Vermillion Bird Holy Sect is currently being forced to stay in their territory by the Inner Pill Sect and the Everlasting Palace. They won’t dare to easily leave their sect’s protection array. Further, as far as I know, Great Emperor Danqing and the other Supreme from the Everlasting Palace have assigned some people to blockade the Vermillion Bird Holy Sect’s land, making it very difficult for anyone from that sect to come out.”</p><p>“It’s very difficult, but it’s not like there’s no way out,” said Undemonized Sovereign Mo.</p><p>Dao Master Qing Feng shook his head and sighed. “Forget it, let’s not talk about them now. The most important thing for us now is to find a way to shake off the Myriad Swords Sect’s pursuit. By the way, are you familiar with this Hundred Sightless region?”</p><p>“No. I’ve been here once, but I’m not too familiar with the place.” Undemonized Sovereign Mo shook his head.</p><p>“Then we’re in trouble.” Dao Master Qing Feng sighed. “Our speed is too slow. If this situation continues, they will catch up with us in half a day at most.”</p><p>For a while, both of them felt a bit helpless and were at a loss as to what to do.</p><p>Suddenly, Dao Master Qing Feng’s expression changed and his eyes were full of vigilance as he shouted fiercely, “Come out! We already found you!”</p><p>“Hahaha, how can you say you found us since you’ve fallen into the trap we’ve laid out for you? You will definitely meet your maker this time!” Four figures appeared out of nowhere in front of them. The one who spoke was their leader, a Perfected Golden Immoral of the Myriad Swords Sect, Blackcrow Venerable.</p><p>Dao Master Qing Feng frowned deeply and asked, “How did you judge our escape route and come here a step ahead?”</p><p>“One of our Myriad Swords Sect’s people has secretly cast the Thousand Miles Scent on you before you fled previously.” Blackcrow Venerable happily smiled. “No matter where you flee, we’ll quickly find you. Most importantly, the Stone City’s City Lord in this Hundred Sightless region is one of ours, to begin with.”</p><p>“You both never expected it, did you? I’m the City Lord of Stone City, Celestial Stone Old Man. Of course, I’m also a disciple of the Myriad Swords Sect.” A white-haired old man with a white beard sneered. A contemptuous look was evident in his eyes as he looked at Dao Master Qing Feng and Undemonized Sovereign Mo.</p><p>Blackcrow Venerable took out 7 black flags from his interspatial ring and quickly arranged the Seven Heavens Sealing Evil Array while looking at Dao Master Qing Feng and Undemonized Sovereign Mo playfully.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
