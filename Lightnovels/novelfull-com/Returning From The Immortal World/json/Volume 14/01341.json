It took them nearly 3 months to finally reach the Heavenly Mountain region.</p><p>The Heavenly Mountain region itself was a desolate region in the Immortal World. Aside from Sunset City and Starmoon City, there was no other concentration of living beings in the region, and the vast Star River was filled by countless floating meteorites. Oftentimes explosions happened as meteorites crashed into the planet.</p><p>The Heavenly Mountain Immortal Domain itself was shrouded by mysterious world law, thus the reason why it could survive in this desolate and dangerous place where the two landmasses connected to each other—the two lands where Sunset City and Starmoon City were located.</p><p>This region had no Domain Master and was a chaotic zone. In order to be able to collect resources from the Heavenly Mountain region, the forces from other Immortal Domains had secretly established their foothold here, and the very reason for the intertwined connections and chaotic situation.</p><p>Sunset City was located atop a towering precipitous and majestic mountain in the western side, surrounded by a ring of glowing clouds that then enveloped the entire mountain and formed a special gravity space. In this place, even Perfected Golden Immortals could only unleash their strength to a limited extent, at most to the Immortal Stage level. It was this powerful suppression that made countless Immortals unwilling to visit this place easily.</p><p>At the moment, 16 thick chains made of thousands of years black, with four of them used to chain a person, consisting of 3 men and a female, on a cliff on the mountainside. There was also a Nine Thunder Array surrounding the four people, and nine lightning bolts bolted down every day and struck the four chained people.</p><p>Dao Lord Green Firmament sat cross-legged on a floating futon, sipping the immortal wine in the purple gold gourd in his hand while smilingly watching the chained four people. Several thousands of kilometers away from him, three long-haired twin brothers were being besieged and beaten up by tens of his Golden Immortal subordinates.</p><p>“Stop fooling around and just slay them directly!”</p><p>Dao Lord Green Firmament comfortably hiccupped, expelling alcohol stench from his nostrils as he hummed with a lack of interest.</p><p>Immediately after, the tens of Golden Immortals a few thousand kilometers away unleashed their respective immortal weapons and struck the three twin brothers at the same time. The twin Golden Immortal brothers had to face the fierce bombardment of tens of powerful enemies, and one of them looked desperate and shouted unwillingly, “Master, your disciple is incompetent! We can’t save you and Martial Uncles. If there’s an afterlife, the three of us will be your disciples again.”</p><p>In the next moment, the three of them wore a decisive expression and exploded themselves at the same time. The powerful explosion blasted in the middle of the tens of Golden Immortals, sending them flying upside down and coughing a mouthful of blood at the same time. Four of them who were the closest to the triplets were directly killed by the explosion.</p><p>“Teng Yun, Teng Xiang, Teng Le…”</p><p>A pained expression painted Enchantress Yu’s beautiful face and two lines of tears slipped down her fair cheek. No matter how hard she struggled, however, she still couldn’t break free from the shackles of the four chains.</p><p>Dao Lord Green Firmament cursed angrily. “Hmph, a bunch of fools who have no long memory even after going through so many battles. All of you can’t even avoid something like those self-exploding bastards?”</p><p>Having cursed at his goons, he shifted to look at Enchantress Yu, whose face now became twisted. A faint smile painted his handsome face as he said, “They die and that’s it. If anything, we captured those ants hundreds of years ago, to begin with. I don’t give a damn even if they died. But Apotheon Enchantress Yu, you raised those three disciples of yours, right? You surely have tried your best to teach them so that they became more and more powerful. Too bad that they are dead now… you must really feel sorry now, yes? Hahaha…”</p><p>Enchantress Yu glared at Dao Lord Green Firmament and roared furiously, “Green Firmament, I beat you and made you a cripple then. If it wasn’t for your damned Master who used many treasures to save you, your shitty corpse would have been fed to the Immortal Beasts already!”</p><p>Dao Lord Green Firmament’s expression hardened and he immediately let out some killing intent, retorting fiercely, “B*tch, if it wasn’t for Master, who forbade me to kill you, I’d have already severed your muscles, skinned you alive and refined you into a puppet slave girl. Just you wait! Wait until you’ve been fully used up here and those who want to rescue you have been slaughtered. I’ll personally refine you into a puppet slave girl, so you’ll face the most brutal torment for endless years.”</p><p>Apotheon Enchantress Yu clenched her first. If stares could kill, she would have killed Dao Lord Green Firmament countless times already.</p><p>Dao Lord Green Firmament happily hummed twice and then threw the purple gold gourd in his interspatial ring. He clapped his hands and, as two Golden Immortals came, he ordered with a smile, “Notify the rest that I’m going to Sunset City to rest. Tell them to take care of this place and don’t easily notify me unless there are some strong enemies.”</p><p>“By your command, Sir,” said the two Golden Immortals respectfully.</p><p>Dao Lord Green Firmament glanced at Enchantress Yu once again and grinned. “Well, I’m going to Sunset City first to gather enough auxiliary materials to make you my puppet slave.”</p><p>Having said that, he laughed uproariously and flew towards Sunset City.</p><p>The calm, serene-looking Apotheon Myriad Notes shot a deep and calm look at Apotheon Enchantress Yu, who was thousands of meters from him, and lightly said, “Junior Sister Yu, evil has never vanquished good since ancient times. The Vermillion Bird Holy Sect has been in existence for hundreds of thousands of years in the Immortal World and our sect’s foundation is very deep and something we cannot imagine. I believe some experts in our sect are going to save us. Wait until the day we are freed from this trouble and that will be the day when we massacre these enemies.”</p><p>Apotheon Enchantress Yu shook her head with a pained expression and no longer spoke.</p><p>Despair had almost overwhelmed her. During this short period of time, at least 1,000 people had died here because the four of them were used as bait. More than half of those 1,000 people were people they cared about. If they continued to be in such a predicament, in less than a century all their loved ones would be completely gone.</p><p>****</p><p>Sunset City.</p><p>Tang Xiu quietly sat in a teahouse while watching the endless stream of people on the street outside the window. He completely restrained his aura and looked like an ordinary mortal who enjoyed savoring the scented tea. Star Tears, who sat in front of him, stared blankly at the tea in her cup and didn’t even move in the slightest for a long while.</p><p>Whoosh….</p><p>A figure suddenly emerged next to Tang Xiu out of the blue—Seaway Monarch. He reported by transmitting his voice, “Master, we’ve investigated around and Myriad Thunder Supreme, Zither Demon Jiuyao’s Martial Uncle, is holding the fort at the Heavenly Mountain. Further, hearsay outside has it that of the 12 Perfected Golden Immortals here, 6 of them are at the helm, whereas there should be a group of 30-plus Golden Immortals. Other than that, I also picked up some good news.”</p><p>Tang Xiu’s expression shifted and he asked, “What good news?”</p><p>“Myriad Thunder Supreme’s disciple Dao Lord Green Firmament came to the Sunset City two days ago and has been staying in the Golden Scent Tower for two days, fooling around with some Immortal prostitutes,” answered Seaway Monarch with a voice transmission.</p><p>Coldness gleamed in Tang Xiu’s eyes. He had met this Dao Lord Green Firmament in the past. However, this guy was just a nobody back then and followed his Master Myriad Thunder Supreme to visit his mansion as a guest. But the vermin from the past had now turned into an abominable bastard who persecuted his disciples.</p><p>“Get rid of him!” Tang Xiu clenched his fists and transmitted his order while reminiscing for a long while.</p><p>Seaway Monarch, who wore a quirky expression, smiled when he heard the order and nodded. “I’ll need Zenith Venerable to assist me on this one.”</p><p>Tang Xiu nodded and summoned Zenith Immortal and Sablefiend Scorpio from the Heavenly Abode artifact, saying, “The two of you will temporarily follow Seaway Monarch’s orders and help me get rid of Dao Lord Green Firmament. Our time is tight, so how about half a month?”</p><p>“That won’t be a problem,” said Seaway Monarch lightly.</p><p>Tang Xiu waved his hand and said, “Then go! I’ll be waiting for you in the Fullmoon Star River.”</p><p>Afterward, Tang Xiu left with Star Tears and headed straight to the Eastern suburbs of Sunset City that led to the Fullmoon Star River. As they arrived in the region, Tang Xiu observed the surrounding environment and began to draw array patterns and buried some Immortal Crystals to arrange the Nine Chains Curve Array.</p><p>After finishing, he sat cross-legged with Star Tears and waited in silence.</p><p>****</p><p>At the Golden Scent Tower.</p><p>Two belles occupied the left and right side of Dao Lord Green Firmament as he was surrounded by a group of alluring females, enjoying the services of the group of Immortal prostitutes. No one noticed that streams of Yin energy were continuously being extracted from the group of Immortal prostitutes and were silently absorbed by Dao Lord Green Firmament.</p><p>It was the Vast Yin Demonic Art, a wicked and fearsome evil technique created by a certain fiend in the Immortal World that allowed those who practiced it to steal the Yin Essence of women around him secretly, to be refined and then absorbed to increase his own cultivation.</p><p>Dao Lord Green Firmament looked like he was a righteous Immortal on the surface, yet he had been secretly cultivating the evil art of Vast Yin Demonic Art that harmed others to benefit himself. Countless women had fallen victim to him.</p><p>BAM…</p><p>A loud bang passed to Dao Lord Green Firmament’s ears.</p><p>His grim and cold eyes instantly shifted to the source of the sound and he suddenly saw a burly man fly in and pulled in the female brothel keeper in the pavilion hall full of women. The belle looked like a docile little bird next to the burly man, who now kicked the chest of the old brothel keeper and nearly killed her.</p><p>“What vulgar b*tches!”</p><p>“Everyone of you here is nothing but cheat sl*ts. All the men who take a liking to b*tches like you here are nothing but blind idiots!”</p><p>The woman—Sablefiend Scorpio in disguise after shapeshifting—contemptuously glanced at everyone around. Looking at the angry eyes aiming at her, she contemptuously said, “My man is a super expert, an invincible Perfected Golden Immortal in the Immortal World. If you have no more beautiful Immortal prostitutes here, you can see how I burn you all along with this place!”</p><p>“What a crazy b*tch!”</p><p>A grim voice was heard from one of the private rooms. A lean man then emerged and his eyes greedily swept across the sensitive areas of Sablefiend Scorpio as he said with a bizarre smile.</p><p>Seaway Monarch raised his brows and indifferently glanced at the guy and slapped that Golden Immortal and sent him flying. Afterward, he looked disappointed and shook his head. “Heh, what a disappointment! The women here are so bad and disappointing. Might as well go to the casino to gamble.”</p><p>Sablefiend Scorpio smilingly said, “Do you still need to gamble after getting so many treasures and tons of Crystal Essences from Demon Dragon Grotto a while ago, Master? Besides, winning money from this dirt-poor bunch is really boring!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
