It’s just a trivial Purple Diamond Alloy, something that doesn’t enter my eyes, either.”</p><p>Wondersky Nightwolf himself had no idea about the identity of Nine Nether Swordmeister. He was anxious after hearing the statement and shouted, “Why do you listen to outsider’s words, Ancestor? That Purple Diamond Alloy can strengthen my bones and make them as strong as a Crossing Tribulation expert’s. You… you must help me obtain it!”</p><p>“What a disgraceful brat!”</p><p>A cold glint flashed in Vastly Martial Nightwolf’s eyes. Although feeling reluctant, he still slapped Wondersky’s face, sending the youth several meters away before he slowly turned around and looked towards Moongazing Monarch City.</p><p>At the same time, everyone else also shifted to the direction of Moongazing Monarch City since they could sense several huge auras coming over.</p><p>“Hey, Brother Nine Nether! I didn’t expect you to be here.”</p><p>Surrounded by a group of people, Tang Xiu came to the front of the crowd with a bright smile on his handsome face.</p><p>“I was originally in Moongazing Monarch City, chatting with Brother Vastly Martial myself. But I didn’t expect him to receive a distress message for help from his offspring, so I followed him here. Much to my surprise, I didn’t expect that Nightwolf Clan’s junior turned out to have some dispute with your people.”</p><p>Tang Xiu nodded with a smile and quickly threw 8 Immortal healing pills to Chen Shaohua’s group. Then, he turned to Vastly Martial Nightwolf and lightly smiled. “Then you’re Sir Vastly Martial Nightwolf, yes?”</p><p>Vastly Martial frowned deeply for he never thought that the foreign aid mentioned by Nine Nether Swordmeister turned out to be a young man who seemed to have just become an Immortal a while ago.</p><p>Yet, he dared to give himself the Great Tang Heavenly Emperor title?</p><p>Vastly Martial shook his head secretly. He was about to speak in order to give face to Nine Nether Swordmeister when his eyes inadvertently glanced at Gu Yan’er at the rear.</p><p>What?!!</p><p>Vastly Martial’s expression froze. His pupils shrank all of a sudden and his figure shook violently. In the next moment, he staggered backward a few steps, pointing and looking at Gu Yan’er with a terrified face.</p><p>Gu Yan’er pursed her brows deeply as she didn’t expect she would meet her former acquaintance in this remote Immortal domain. Pacing a step forward, she indifferently said, “Well, well, a dog of mine in the past turned out to have become a solemn Perfected Golden Immortal, huh? Had I known earlier such a thing would happen today, I should’ve slaughtered you directly to save wasting our time here.”</p><p>Vastly Martial’s face was uglier than crying. Amidst the confused expression of everyone from Nightwolf Clan and Nine Nether Swormeister alike in the surrounding, he staggered forward toward Gu Yan’er step by step. Beads of sweat profusely dribbled down his forehead, face, and neck. 10 meters away from Gu Yan’er, he knelt on the ground and powerfully knocked his forehead on the ground stuttered with a fearful expression. “You… you’re…. this small one is really damned! This one had no idea that they are your people. P-Please…. Please forgive this small one’s dog life… I beg you…”</p><p>Such a scene made everyone dumbfounded with disbelief filling their eyes.</p><p>Nine Nether Swordmeister, on the other hand, looked very vigilant and a tempestuous storm was set in his heart. It must be noted that Vastly Martial Nightwolf was a Perfected Golden Immortal powerhouse. Even if he just advanced to the Perfected Golden Immortal Stage not long ago, being able to reach this level meant that he was very powerful himself.</p><p>Yet, such a dignified and dazzling Perfected Golden Immortan unexpectedly acted… like a dog and knelt in front of Gu Yan’er and desperately begged for mercy? What did that mean? That meant the woman next to Great Tang Heavenly Emperor was absolutely a very terrifying existence.</p><p>Gu Yan’er just glanced at the man indifferently. She then turned to Tang Xiu and respectfully said, “Master, back when I went on a rampage in some Immortal Domains, I was too lazy to wipe out some ants, so I caught some ruthless characters to carry out my whims to decimate those people. I remember that his brat was just a trivial Golden Immortal back then.”</p><p>M-Master…. MASTER?!!!</p><p>Vastly Martial was so terrified that he nearly peed his pants. Back in the past, this female devil was so terrifyingly powerful. Yet, she actually addressed this Great Tang Heavenly Emperor as her Master?!!</p><p>Heavens! Then… they… they were intentionally hiding their power? These fucking people were playing pigs to devour the tiger!</p><p>Tang Xiu gently nodded and looked the kneeling Vastly Martial Nightwolf on the ground. He quickly thought deeply about how to solve this issue. Their identity was very important and must not be easily revealed. Gu Yan’er once told him that, even though she had killed many people back when she was rampaging in the Immortal world, only a few people knew that she was his disciple.</p><p>In other words, this guy knew just how terrifying Gu Yan’er was and thus, couldn’t directly guess who he really was through Gu Yan’er.</p><p>Further, this man was a Perfected Golden Immortal. If both sides really went so far and finally clashed, his side would likely have to pay quite a huge price even if they did win.</p><p>Then….</p><p>Tang Xiu sighed and said, “You know, Yan’er, Master has told you many times already. Never kill the innocent indiscriminately. You used to be so naughty and wreak havoc everywhere and I’ve never restrained you. But I won’t allow you to mess around anymore. He… after all, he has worked for you in the past and is not an enemy. Just let him go!”</p><p>Gu Yan’er understood his intention and shifted to Vastly Martial again, saying indifferently, “What should be done and should not, as well as what should be said and should not… You know very well about my rules, don’t you?”</p><p>Vastly Martial Nightwolf looked ecstatic and nodded desperately. “Yes, yes. This ugly one will respectfully carry out your rules. Things that shouldn’t be carried out will never be committed, and words that shouldn’t come out must never be revealed.”</p><p>“Scram and go back to your turf!” Gu Yan’er said, “You’re not allowed to come out for the next century!”</p><p>“Yes, yes, yes. This ugly one will scram right away.”</p><p>Vastly Martial looked grateful and waved his sleeves. The remaining people of Nightwolf Clan exploded and turned into a blood mist, killed by him in a flash. The man himself seemed to have grown more legs and couldn’t wait to run away in distress into the distance.</p><p>Nine Nether Swordmeister was now completely shaken. Never once in his wildest dreams did he think such a solemn Perfected Golden Immortal powerhouse like Vastly Martial Nightwolf would be so terrified to this extent. He even killed his own descendants just because of the identity of the other party.</p><p>He… how terrified he really was?</p><p>Tang Xiu could only shake his head secretly. Then, he looked at Nine Nether Swordmeister and smilingly said, “Ah, I’m ashamed that you had to see such a scene, Brother Nine Nether.”</p><p>Nine Nether Swordmeister gulped down quietly and forced out a wry smile. “That can’t be counted as a joke. Even it gives me some fright here. Brother Vastly Martial Nightwolf… for good or bad, he’s also a Perfected Golden Immortal himself, yet I never thought that he… Haih, forget it. I understand that there are things that are not supposed to be said or asked. Anyway, Brother Great Tang, my gambling event is just less than 3 months away, so I hope I can count on your help more.”</p><p>“No worries!” Tang Xiu nodded and smilingly said, “I’ll definitely do my best.”</p><p>Nine Nether Swordmeister glanced at Gu Yan’er again and bade farewell before he left. He had secretly guessed at the moment that Gu Yan’er had been deliberately hiding her strength. Other than for that reason, how come a Golden Immortal could force a Perfected Golden Immortal to such a terrified state?</p><p>At this moment, only Tang Xiu’s group remained here.</p><p>“Master, would you like me to kill that Vastly Martial Nightwolf?” asked Gu Yan’er through a voice transmission.</p><p>“Does he know your true identity and the relationship between us?” asked Tang Xiu.</p><p>“He knows my true identity, but he doesn’t know our relationship,” answered Gu Yan’er.</p><p>“Him knowing your true identity is a troublesome issue in itself.” Tang Xiu said, “Others may not know our relationship, but a handful knows it, including Heavenly Emperor Tianji and Shade Demon Zhu Wushou. Removing him is a must before we leave.”</p><p>“In that case, we may have to stay here longer,” Gu Yan’er replied.</p><p>Tang Xiu thought for a moment and said, “No need. I’m preparing to leave for the Heavenly Net Immortal Domain and I’ll be back before the gamble between Nine Nether Swordmeister with his enemy.”</p><p>“What exactly are you going to do?” Gu Yan’er hurriedly asked with a changed expression.</p><p>“I’m going to purchase deathmatch fighters again,” said Tang Xiu.</p><p>“Do you perhaps want to buy a Perfected Golden Immortal gladiator, by chance?” Gu Yan’er asked, “You also know that each Perfected Golden Immortal gladiator is terrifyingly powerful, don’t you? Do we have so many Crystal Essences?”</p><p>“A Perfected Golden Immortal gladiator used to be available for purchase for some tens of millions Crystal Essences,” Tang Xiu said. “I got a lot of Crystal Essences right now, enough to buy a Perfected Golden Immortal gladiator. When I go to the Heavenly Net Immortal Domain, I’ll find some ways to obtain more Crystal Essences and try to buy some Perfected Golden Immortal gladiators.”</p><p>“Shall I accompany you there, Master? I won’t feel at ease otherwise,” Gu Yan’er said.</p><p>“Don’t forget my previous identity, Yan’er,” Tang Xiu calmly said. “I still have my own way to survive since I could become a Supreme. Also, you cannot leave Moongazing Monarch City for the time being. I can tell that guy is definitely not fully at ease and he’ll definitely send people to keep tabs on you. Only if you stay at Moongazing Monarch City can that guy feel at ease, I reckon.”</p><p>Gu Yan’er nodded wordlessly and said, “Then you must take all those Golden Immortals with you, Master.”</p><p>“No. I’ll only take Battle Peng and four others. The rest will stay with you,” Tang Xiu said. “Traveling with a few people won’t be easy to be noticed by others, and I won’t be in danger once I’ve bought some Perfected Golden Immortals by then.”</p><p>“About this…”</p><p>Gu Yan’er still wanted to argue more. But after seeing Tang Xiu’s firm expression, she finally had no choice but to agree.</p><p>Shortly after, the group returned to Moongazing Monarch City. After Tang Xiu, Gu Yan’er, and the rest waltzed into the Stargazing Pavilion under the attention of many people, Tang Xiu took Battle Peng and four other Golden Immortals two days later and left quietly. Aside from the elderly Golden Immortal from Stargazing Pavilion, no one else knew about his departure.</p><p>There was only one Immortal Domain between Hessen Castle and Heavenly Net Immortal Domains. Tang Xiu’s group of six only spent a week before they arrived in the Heavenly Net Immortal Domain. Although they encountered some troubles along the way, the aura released by Battle Peng and the others were able to scare off all the troubles and thus avoid fighting.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
