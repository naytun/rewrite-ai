Furthermore, this mysterious man had been preparing for so long before he was ready to storm the Vast Martial Sect, so the chance was very high that he came really prepared.</p><p>“I’m going, then!” the old man gritted his teeth and replied in a deep voice.</p><p>Tang Xiu nodded at his reply. Under the guide of this old man, it took them 2 days to come to a small land in this Immortal Domain. While looking at the pavilions in the dense forest of the mountain range, Tang Xiu asked, “So, this is where the Vast Martial Sect resides?”</p><p>“Yes, this is their place,” said the old man.</p><p>Between his words, a murderous glint flashed in his eyes, apparently full of hatred toward the Vast Martial Sect.</p><p>Tang Xiu shifted to Battle Peng and lightly said, “You and Dragonfly are to stay here. I believe I don’t have to tell you what to do when something unexpected happens, yes?”</p><p>Battle Peng glanced at the old man and nodded. “Please rest assured, Master. I know what to do.”</p><p>Tang Xiu nodded slightly. Then he shifted to the six Perfected Golden Immortals and indifferently said, “Before you start working for me, I’m giving you hope first. Pledge your loyalty to me for 5,000 years. I’ll give you back your freedom as long as you’re still alive by then. At that time, you’re free to choose whether you will keep staying with me or leave directly. Further, I’ll also continuously provide you with various cultivation resources and teach you various divine and secret arts. The bigger your merits, the more handsome the rewards you’ll obtain. Do you understand?”</p><p>“Really?!”</p><p>The six people were surprised and asked in unison.</p><p>“You can count on every word spoken by Great Tang Heavenly Emperor for I’ve never broken my promise.” Tang Xiu nodded.</p><p>The six people quickly exchanged glances and immediately nodded one after another. They knelt on one knee at the same time and vowed in a deep voice. “We’re willing to serve you, Master!”</p><p>Tang Xiu took out six Praecantator artifacts and threw them over, saying, “I have no high-grade immortal artifacts available for you at the moment. You will refine these Praecantator artifacts. Use these weapons for the time being!”</p><p>Sablefiend Scorpio took the Praecantator weapon, carefully observed it, and then blurted out in horror, “Isn’t this the weapon of Diabolos Praecantator Clan? Heavens! This is at least the high-grade weapon the combat generals of that Clan used! This weapon is definitely comparable to a 7th grade immortal weapon!”</p><p>The other five were also shocked. They were all Perfected Golden Immortals—old monsters who had lived for thousands of years. In particular, Sablefiend Scorpio had lived for tens of thousands of years and was naturally able to recognize the value of these Praecantator artifacts.</p><p>“I have a lot of such weapons in my hand,” said Tang Xiu casually. “There are even better ones, a lot of them. As long as you are loyal to me, not only will you become stronger in the future, there will also be countless resources for you.”</p><p>Sablefiend Scorpio’s group of six glanced at each other and said, “We’re pledging our allegiance till our death, Master!”</p><p>Tang Xiu nodded with satisfaction. Then, he shifted to the surprised Star Tears and calmly said, “Alright, this time, what you have to do is help me get the Soul Pursuit Token from the Vast Martial Sect. I’m sure all of you already know what the Soul Pursuit Token is. I need this object since I’m going to need Battlesoul Supreme’s help in dealing with some issues in the future. Thus, you must storm over the Vast Martial Sect’s Perfected Golden Immortal Ancestor with overwhelming strength. You are not to give him any chance of using the Soul Pursuit Token.”</p><p>“Understood!” everyone replied in a deep voice.</p><p>15 minutes later.</p><p>Tang Xiu glanced around. Just as he was about to take out the Message Token, three streaks of light quickly flashed from the distance and appeared in front of Tang Xiu.</p><p>Tang An, donning her usual black robe, arrived with Zenith Venerable and Seaway Monarch and respectfully reported. “We’ve destroyed all the protection arrays surrounding the Vast Martial Sect, Grand Master. They will no longer be able to activate their sect’s protection array even if they discover us.”</p><p>Tang Xiu nodded with satisfaction and sneered. “Heh, we got 9 Perfected Golden Immortals. If we fail to get the Vast Martial Sect’s Soul Pursuit Token, that will likely become the shame of your lives. Anyways, commence the action, now!”</p><p>“Understood!”</p><p>The nine people nodded and their figures suddenly bolted away as fast as meteors. In nearly a flash, they appeared in the sky over the Vast Martial Sect. Shortly after, the nine of them struck together and directly stunned all the Vast Martial Sect’s disciples below the Golden Immortal Stage. Even the Golden Immortals of this sect were all coughing up a mouthful of blood and looked terrified.</p><p>“Which thieves came to provoke my Vast Martial Sect?”</p><p>Three figures streaked up into the sky and instantly appeared in mid-air. Frantic killing intent gleamed in the eyes of the leader among them, a white-haired old man in a white robe.</p><p>But when he clearly saw that the nine people in the surroundings turned out to be Perfected Golden Immortals, however, he sensed the terrifying pressure of their auras. He was terrified.</p><p>“Suppress him!”</p><p>As Tang Xiu and Tang An appeared thousands of meters in the sky out of nowhere, he shouted coldly.</p><p>The nine Perfected Golden Immortals attacked fiercely at the same time. Aside from that elderly Perfected Golden Immortal, the other two were late-stage Golden Immortals and just a hair away from breaking through to the Perfected Golden Immortal Stage. Both of them spurted out a mouthful of blood at the same time after getting bombarded by Star Tears and Sablefiend Scorpio. They didn’t directly die and fainted instead.</p><p>“Who the hell are you, people? What kind of enmity does the Vast Martial Sect have with you, to think that you even dispatched nine Perfected Golden Immortals to destroy my sect?” The white-haired old man tried to fight back desperately but was still seriously injured.</p><p>“Give up your resistance!” Tang Xiu ruthlessly and coldly said, “We can decimate everyone in your Sect. If you do not, nothing will be left alive in your sect, including chickens and dogs!”</p><p>The white-haired old man furiously roared. But facing the fierce onslaught of nine Perfected Golden Immortals, he was forced to directly give up his resistance. As Star Tears captured and sealed him, Tang Xiu floated up in front of him, looked at him, and grabbed his collar before towing him into the tallest building below.</p><p>“This place is the Hall to enshrine and pay homage to your ancestors, yes?” Tang Xiu asked with a smile.</p><p>The white-haired old man looked as though he was dying and nodded. “That’s right.”</p><p>“Stun all those Golden Immortals hiding here!” ordered Tang Xiu with a smile.</p><p>In a flash, four figures disappeared. In just several breaths, the four soon appeared near Tang Xiu out of nowhere.</p><p>Tang Xiu shifted to the old man again and smilingly said, “You have quite the treasure yet you have no strength to preserve it. Quite the easy way to invite calamity upon you, am I right?”</p><p>“You’re correct,” the Ancestor of Vast Martial Sect replied in a muffled voice.</p><p>“Well, since you also think that what I said makes sense, take out the Soul Pursuit Token received by your Vast Martial Sect! Don’t ask me how I know. I have my own intel channel.”</p><p>The Vast Martial Sect’s ancestor could only let out a mirthless smile and took a black token directly from his interspatial ring and handed it to Tang Xiu, saying bitterly, “This is the Soul Pursuit Token.”</p><p>Tang Xiu held the token and fiddled it in his hand for a while before he smiled lightly. “Yup, this is indeed the Soul Pursuit Token. I obtained two of them before but didn’t expect to get a third. Well, you’re a sensible man. I can spare all disciples of your Vast Martial Sect since you gave me the Soul Pursuit Token. But you also know what to say and what not to after we leave, don’t you?”</p><p>“I know.” The Vast Martial Sect’s ancestor bitterly replied.</p><p>“Then I won’t waste more words since you already understand.” Tang Xiu nodded with satisfaction. “But from now on, you can say that I owe the Vast Martial Sect a favor, so I’m leaving this Message Token. If your sect were to face a life-and-death crisis, use this token to notify me and I’ll send my people to the rescue.”</p><p>The Vast Martial Sect’s Ancestor froze for a moment and he said in disbelief, “You mean…”</p><p>“Well, let’s just say that I hate to take advantage of others for nothing,” said Tang Xiu lightly. “You may say that my methods are not honorable, but I have my own reason to do so. A very strong reason. I did sever your chance to have Battlesoul Supreme’s assistance, but I owe you a favor in exchange. No worries. Even if the person you must face in the future is a Supremacy Stage expert, I can still exterminate him for you.”</p><p>Having said that, Tang Xiu nodded to Star Tears.</p><p>Star Tears lifted up the seal on the Vast Martial Sect’s Ancestor and indifferently said, “What my Heavenly Emperor has promised will be fulfilled. You can choose whether you want your Vast Martial Sect to be annihilated and be the target of endless pursuit, or to remain silent and keep this favor for use in the future. The choice is yours.”</p><p>Tang Xiu took out a healing elixir and handed it to the Vast Martial Sect’s Ancestor and then immediately left with the rest.</p><p>“Ugh… they left… just like that?”</p><p>Disbelief was cast on the face of Vast Martial Sect’s Ancestor. He originally thought that today was the day he met his death, but he never expected that the other party only demanded the Soul Pursuit Token. They didn’t even kill anyone.</p><p>After a long while, he muttered to himself, “Who exactly are they?”</p><p>After obtaining the Soul Pursuit Token, Tang Xiu didn’t immediately contact Battlesoul Supreme. He had met this Supreme several times in the past and even fought side by side with him in the endless abyss to kill a lot of extraterrestrial demons in the Outer Territory. But when it came to friendship, they had no deep bonds and could only be said to be ordinary friends at best.</p><p>This Battlesoul Supreme was just a hair inferior to him in his heyday.</p><p>Therefore, Tang Xiu decided not to use this Soul Pursuit Token unless it was absolutely necessary. The best time was to use it to invite Battlesoul Supreme in the final decisive battle.</p><p>“Shall we go back now, Grand Master?”</p><p>Seeing Tang Xiu and the rest return, Tang An quickly asked.</p><p>Tang Xiu nodded and said, “We’ll return directly. There are some things that should be done.”</p><p>Tang An had no idea what these issues were about, but she still nodded. Prior to this, she received a message from Tang Xiu to bring Seaway Monarch and Zenith Venerable over, so there were only Apotheon Mu and her Master, Gu Yan’er, at the helm in the Great Tang Empire’s stronghold in the Misty Spring Ocean.</p><p>“I hereby appoint you all as the Protector Elders of the Great Tang Empire!”</p><p>Before returning, Tang Xiu solemnly spoke to the six Perfected Golden Immortals.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
