After all, no matter how powerful a Golden Immortal was, there were only a few Perfected Golden Immortals in any Immortal Domain. Even the strongest people in Agaric Castle were very likely only at the late-stage Golden Immortal Stage.</p><p>Star Tears herself was too lazy to bother about this man and kept silent while standing next to Tang Xiu calmly.</p><p>“So 6 Immortal Crystals for this thing, yes?” said Tang Xiu indifferently.</p><p>The middle-aged man hurriedly said, “No, just 2 million Immortal Crystals and this Octagem Golden Lotus Minaret is yours. I don’t think anyone will dare to object.”</p><p>The pale-faced old man hurriedly nodded with a timid look and said, “I won’t dare object, either. Only someone like Senior has the qualification to use this treasure.”</p><p>Tang Xiu slightly smiled and he took out 2 million Immortal Crystals, threw them to the middle-aged man, and said, “I need all colored poisonous mushrooms, or best, some seven-colored ones. Your shop assistant took me to this 6th floor, so you have some of them for sale, right?”</p><p>“Our store does have all colored poisonous mushrooms, and it’s quite coincidental that we happened to receive the shipment 2 days ago. However, we have no seven-colored ones at the moment. If Honored Patron really needs them, you have to wait for some time. We have spent several years on the arrangement and we should be close to harvesting it, so when the time comes, we’ll have the seven-colored toadstool delivered here.”</p><p>“How long will it take, exactly?” asked Tang Xiu.</p><p>“About 3 months if there’s no accident,” said the middle-aged man.</p><p>Tang Xiu nodded and slowly said, “Then sell me the five-colored ones first. I’ll give 100,000 Immortal Crystals as a deposit first and I’ll return here to buy the seven-colored ones 3 months later.”</p><p>The middle-aged man hesitated and said, “Honored Patron, the price of a five-colored toadstool is already very expensive, the seven-colored ones are much higher. Are you really going to buy them?”</p><p>“What are the prices for two toadstools, exactly?” asked Tang Xiu.</p><p>“The five-colored ones are priced at 1 million Immortal Crystals, and the seven-colored ones are at 8 million Immortal Crystals,” answered the middle-aged man.</p><p>Tang Xiu then directly handed him 2 million Immortal Crystals and lightly said, “Then I will give you a million more as a deposit. The remaining 7 million will be paid to you directly when I see the seven-colored toadstool. After all, spending a little money is nothing to me.”</p><p>The middle-aged man’s eyes lit up and he happily smiled. “Please rest assured, Honored Patron. I’ll definitely keep the seven-colored toadstools for you when the shipment arrives.”</p><p>Quickly after, Tang Xiu took the fist-sized five-colored toadstool and was secretly happy inwardly when he looked at it. Five-colored toadstools could be concocted to some very good poison pills, but if he could get the seven-colored ones, the poison pill he refined was likely able to cause heavy damage to Perfected Golden Immortals.</p><p>“Alright, let’s head out!”</p><p>Tang Xiu then took his group to leave the Phantasmagoric House. Just as they walked for a kilometer on the street with an endless stream of people, Tang Xiu’s expression shifted and a surprised look appeared in his eyes. He then turned his head and said, “Let’s head to the teahouse in front. Bring that man to me. I’ll be waiting.”</p><p>Battle Peng slightly nodded and bolted towards the old man stalking them.</p><p>A few minutes after, when the scented tea from the teahouse was just delivered to Tang Xiu, the old man stalker strode into the teahouse. He hesitated for a short while and looked at Tang Xiu vigilantly.</p><p>“You can speak now!”</p><p>Tang Xiu took a sip of the scented tea and looked at the old man.</p><p>The old man took a deep breath and said in a low voice, “May I ask whether Senior has 1 million Crystal Essences?”</p><p>Tang Xiu pursed his brows and said, “A million Crystal Essences is nothing but a small amount of money I can take out at any time. Why do you ask?”</p><p>The old man looked happy and asked again, “I wonder if Senior has ever heard of the Soul Pursuit Token?”</p><p>Tang Xiu’s complexion changed and he nodded. “Soul Pursuit Token originated from Battlesoul Supreme, and there’s only 9 of them circulating in the Immortal World. 6 of them have appeared, and each person who once held it was able to make a request to Battlesoul Supreme, where he then acted to fulfill the request of the person regardless of what it was.”</p><p>“You’re mistaken in this regard,” said the old man. “The seventh Soul Pursuit Token actually appeared around 260 years ago. After Battlesoul Supreme received the Soul Pursuit Token, he chased Chromatic Serpent Supreme for a century before he finally killed him in some desolate ruins. So there are still two Soul Pursuit Tokens left.”</p><p>Tang Xiu squinted his eyes and faintly asked, “Do you have a Soul Pursuit Token, by chance?”</p><p>The old man shook his head. “No. I have no Soul Pursuit Token, but I have information about it. If Senior is willing to pay me 1 million Crystal Essences, I can tell you about it. I guarantee the reliability of this information and the fact that it’s not difficult to obtain.”</p><p>“There’s one thing I want to know, however. How many times have you sold the information about this Soul Pursuit Token?” asked Tang Xiu lightly.</p><p>“No, I haven’t sold the info to anyone.” The old man shook his head. “You’re the first.”</p><p>Tang Xiu nodded. “Let’s see. If your info is true, I can give you 1 million Crystal Essences. But, let me tell you bluntly now. I can only give you 500,000 Crystal Essences now and I’ll pay you the remaining 500,000 when I obtain the Soul Pursuit Token.”</p><p>“No problem.”</p><p>The old man looked excited and transmitted his voice, “The Soul Pursuit Token is now enshrined in the Vast Martial Sect and is guarded by its Ancestor, the only Perfected Golden Immortal there, along with 18 Golden Immortals.”</p><p>“And how did you know that?” asked Tang Xiu with a frown.</p><p>A look of hatred gleamed in the eyes of the old man. He clenched his fists and fiercely said, “The daughter of the Vice Sect Master of Vast Martial Sect was the woman I loved. But since I have no background and lack aptitude in cultivation, I was eventually beaten and she died under the pressure of her own sect. I’ve been hating myself for having no abilities, else I’d have killed the entire Vast Martial Sect myself.”</p><p>Tang Xiu nodded and said, “Sorry if this made you recall something unpleasant. Take this half a million Crystal Essences. I’ll contact you personally when I get the Soul Pursuit Token and give you the rest. But if you deceive me, I promise you’ll be under endless pursuit no matter which corner of Immortal Domain you try to hide.”</p><p>COMMENT</p><p>The old man received half a million Crystal Essences and firmly said, “If Senior doesn’t trust me, you can first cast a seal on me. I know that many top powerhouses can cast such tracing seals.”</p><p>Tang Xiu slightly smiled and came to the old man’s front. He patted his shoulder gently and, after asking his Message Token, he then turned around and left.</p><p>“He already cast a seal on me?”</p><p>The old man’s expression shifted and watched Tang Xiu leave. But his expression was complicated as he never noticed how Tang Xiu cast and put that seal on him.</p><p>Outside Agaric Castle.</p><p>Tang Xiu’s eyes were gleaming. He didn’t plan to go to the Vast Martial Sect immediately. After all, there was a Perfected Golden Immortal holding the fort there.</p><p>Buzz…</p><p>After activating the Message Token, Tang Xiu led Battle Peng’s group of three to continue his journey.</p><p>****</p><p>Sacred Dragon Immortal Domain.</p><p>This region could definitely be ranked in the top ten among all the large Immortal Domains in the Immortal World. Golden Immortals could be seen literally everywhere in this region, and one could run into Perfected Golden Immortals often; even some Supremes appeared in this region occasionally.</p><p>The headquarters of the Convict Arena was set up in the Sacred Dragon Immortal Domain, and it had even become a city by itself named Prison Cell City.</p><p>The southern area of Prison Cell City.</p><p>In a dilapidated courtyard, Old Sycamore laid on the deck chair, comfortably hiccupped and hummed some tunes, while a horned wolf crouched and curled up at his feet with a listless look.</p><p>Ding, ding…</p><p>The silver bell at the door suddenly sounded and a ponytailed teenage girl appeared in the courtyard like a gust of wind and cried out with a smiling face, “Hey, Grandpa Sycamore, you have some guests!”</p><p>Old Sycamore rolled his eyes and hummed. “Mmm… you know this old thing just killed some kittens and puppies a few days ago, right? My old bones have been worked out too hard, my whole body is now hurting! Just tell your Mother to receive the guests, will you? Oh dear, I’m really too old and really vexed now! Just a few errands are enough to make my back to ache and my legs to cramp.”</p><p>The lass appeared beside him with a smiling face as she reached out and twisted the old man’s ears, grinningly saying, “Mom has already gone to guide other guests and the two of us are the only ones left at home. Do you really want to make me work as a guide now?”</p><p>Old Sycamore was startled, shook off the girl’s hand, and shook his head, “No! You’re not leaving. I’ll go! Which time have you not made tons of troubles when you became a guide? Stay still and I’ll go by myself. But it’s weird, though. Didn’t you say some guests are here? Why can’t I see any of them?”</p><p>The lass pursed her lips and hummed. “Humph, those guests have a big appetite. They’re shouting that they want Old Sycamore to come out and greet them personally. Well, I originally wanted to pour him a pot of cold water, but whoever thought that he got some powerful goons around him? Those two people made me a bit scared.”</p><p>Old Sycamore’s eyes were gleaming, but he still sluggishly got up. While dragging his body outside, he said, “Those who want me to greet personally are likely my old customers. But you lass who is never afraid of some Perfected Golden Immortals, yet there are some who can make you scared stiff like that now? That’s quite interesting.”</p><p>The girl rolled her eyes and followed with a grin.</p><p>Outside the courtyard.</p><p>After Old Sycamore saw the four people, his eyes instantly narrowed. He especially paused for a while when he saw Star Tears before turning to Tang Xiu, who was obviously the leader. Then, he asked with a smile, “Greetings and nice to meet you, Honored Guest. You look unfamiliar, but you turn out to know this Old Sycamore. May I know which Lord recommended me to you?”</p><p>A complicated expression flashed in Tang Xiu’s eyes and he said with a slight smile, “There was a Little Beggar who talked about the Small Sycamore in Prison Cell City. I just didn’t expect that the Small Sycamore has now become an Old Sycamore.”</p><p>Little Beggar?!</p><p>Old Sycamore’s body trembled and a sharp and fierce light gleamed in his eyes. His rickety body straightened up in a flash. An enormous aura burst out of him and he shouted in a deep voice, “Who are you, Mister? How do you know him?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
