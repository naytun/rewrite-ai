Some of them are Perfected Golden Immortals. The rest of the powerhouses from several neighboring Immortal Domains came due to the gamble between Nine Nether Swordmeister and Venerable Netherworld. They are rushing to Moongazing Monarch City. On the surface, the entire Moongazing Monarch City looks to be stable, but some dark tides are working in the background already. If the news of the Hunter Clan’s Young Master were to carelessly leak out from the wild guesses coming from your mouths, you can expect that we will be in for huge trouble.”</p><p>Several folks exchanged looks and finally realized the seriousness of the matter and promised never to talk nonsense anymore.</p><p>Great Demon Venerable waved his hand and said, “I’m giving you 100 Immortal Crystals each later on. You are to stay in the shop and cultivate all the time. I’m going to stroll around to meet some old buddies of mine.”</p><p>****</p><p>At the Stargazing Pavilion.</p><p>Tang Xiu had just returned and learned from Gu Yan’er that six Spirit Formation Stage members of the Tiger Army, as well as a high official of Great Tang Empire Chen Shaohua, had encountered an ambush of an unidentified group of experts. The other party had an Immortal at the rear, but luckily for their side, the Immortal Monster who protected them appeared in time and saved them from being killed.</p><p>“Who is the other party?” asked Tang Xiu with a cold, heavy voice.</p><p>“There’s no news yet. Our Intelligence Department has yet to set up an intel network here and, due to our unfamiliarity with this place and its natives, we have yet able to figure out who the other party is,” Gu Yan’er said. “However, two Golden Immortals have been dispatched to catch up with them. They should be able to solve the issues there.”</p><p>“Where’s the place?” asked Tang Xiu.</p><p>“At the dry spot of Deepsoil River,” Gu Yan’er said.</p><p>“Let’s go take a look!” Tang Xiu said, “We met quite a lot of powerhouses on the way back. Many of them should be catching up from other Immortal Domains. I think Moongazing Monarch City won’t be too peaceful in the coming days.”</p><p>Feeling puzzled, Gu Yan’er asked, “What kind of major event is going to happen here?”</p><p>“Is the gamble between two Perfected Golden Immortals not a major event in itself?” Tang Xiu said lightly, “This Hessen Castle is just a small Immortal Domain as there’s no Supremacy Stage expert here. Hence, matters pertaining to Perfected Golden Immortals are already serious and terrifying issues to the billion other walks of life here.”</p><p>“You’re right, Master.” Gu Yan’er nodded after hearing. “There are probably a few Perfected Golden Immortals in the entire Hessen Castle Domain. Even among millions of Perfected Golden Immortals, the emergence of someone advancing to the Supremacy Stage among them is not necessarily happening, so the gambling between two Perfected Golden Immortals is indeed a big deal here. However, the cultivation level of our Great Tang Empire’s people is not yet high. If you are to restrain them and just let them understand the situation in the Immortal World and prevent them from making trouble, I think it shouldn’t be a problem.”</p><p>“Our empire has too many people and accidents will inevitably happen,” Tang Xiu said. “I’ve decided to visit the Convict Arena again in the near future to buy another batch of Golden Immortals.”</p><p>“We have 20 Golden Immortals and the number is far too few indeed. Buying another batch would indeed enable us to deal with any danger we encounter in the future.” Gu Yan’er nodded.</p><p>****</p><p>In the dry area of Deepsoil River.</p><p>Two Golden Immortals of the Great Tang Empire, Celestial Immortal Stage Immortal Monsters, stood in front of Chen Shaohua and the six members of the Tiger Army, facing a group of Immortals in front.</p><p>At this moment, green blood drenched the Celestial Immortal Stage Immortal Monster’s attire. Even the immortal sword in his hand had been cut to half, whereas Chen Shaohua and the six members of the Tiger Army were all scarred and looked extremely miserable.</p><p>As for the other party, the group consisted of 18 people in total. Aside from a Profound Immortal expert among them, there were 4 Celestial Immortals and the rest were cultivators at the Spirit Formation Stage.</p><p>The four Celestial Immortals and that Profound Immortal surrounded a Spirit Formation Stage young cultivator. The youth looked very young, apparently in his 17-plus of age. His figure was lean and his face was pale, but an unruly and rebellious look was apparent on his face.</p><p>“Hand over that Purple Diamond Alloy and lay down your life! Else, the moment my Nightwolf Clan’s elders arrive here is when you’re gonna die without a burial ground.” The boy’s murderous eyes locked on the Great Tang Empire’s members as he threatened.</p><p>Although Chen Shaohua was seriously injured, his eyes shone coldly. After walking to the side of two Golden Immortals, he coldly said, “We’re the first who get the Purple Diamond Alloy, so why should we give it to you? I already told you that you can have it if you pay 1 million Immortal Crystals, else don’t even think about it.”</p><p>The teenager clenched his fists with eyes filled with killing intent. He stroked his chin and said, “No one dares snatch anything Wondersky Nightwolf takes a liking to. No one. You must still hand it over to me even if you get it first. Your Young Lord is now upset, so fucking deeply upset. I’ll make you die without a burial ground if you don’t give it to me now!”</p><p>Having said that, a purple gold gourd appeared in his hand out of thin air. He pulled out the cork and drank Immortal Wine, proudly stating, “You should be from other Immortal Domains, right? To think that you never heard of Nightwolf Clan, you truly are blissfully ignorant! Let me tell you. My Nightwolf Clan is one of the strongest powers in Moongazing Monarch City. We have countless Golden Immortals and our Ancestor is a late-stage Golden Immortal. Pity that Ancestor just has to meet his friends in Moongazing Monarch City. But it’s likely Ancestor can immediately rush here. You’re all gonna die very miserably if you don’t hand over that Purple Diamond Alloy.”</p><p>A late-stage Golden Immortal?</p><p>The two late-stage Golden Immortals’ eyes flashed with contempt. However, they were only responsible to protect the Great Tang Empire’s people, and it was not convenient to deal with the matters themselves. Therefore, they just looked at Chen Shaohua. As long as Chen Shaohua ordered, they would immediately strike and go for the kill.</p><p>Chen Shaohua, however, was a bit hesitant. He had no idea that the two powerhouses around him were also late-stage Golden Immortals. He recalled His Majesty’s order not to commit anything that would cause trouble outside.</p><p>Further, he didn’t know much about the situation in the Immortal World, and he was unclear about how large the power of the clans in the Immortal World was. Therefore, he kept hesitating, at a loss of how he should proceed.</p><p>Suddenly, everyone shifted their attention to the direction of Moongazing Monarch City since they could sense the coming of several enormous auras in their direction. Among them was an aura that made the two Golden Immortal powerhouses of the Great Tang Empire feel a sense of crisis.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>In just several breaths, the tens of figures appeared in front of everyone.</p><p>“Wondersky, I received your distress message. What’s going on here?” an old man in front inquisitively asked with creased brows.</p><p>Wondersky Nightwolf hurriedly cried out, “Ancestor, the Purple Diamond Alloy I fancied was robbed by this group of punks! Originally, the fight was between juniors below the Immortal Stage. But when they found they can’t take us on, that Immortal Monster got involved. After not being able to beat us, then came some other helpers. Those two guys are likely Profound Immortals!”</p><p>Vastly Martial Nightwolf.</p><p>He was the ancestor of the Nightwolf Clan who had broken through to the Perfected Golden Immortal Stage decades ago. Being a low-key person, only a handful of people in the whole Moongazing Monarch City knew that he had become a Perfected Golden Immortal. He looked at the two Golden Immortals of the Great Tang Empire with slightly creased brows. He could keenly sense that even though these two fellows had Golden Immortal aura, there was something about them that made him slightly vigilant.</p><p>“Just some trivial and weak late-stage Golden Immortals. Just kill them if you want to.” The eyes of a middle-aged fatty standing next to Vastly Martial Nightwolf flashed with disdain as he stated indifferently.</p><p>Recalling his own status as a Perfected Golden Immortal and also Nine Nether Swordmeister, a mid-stage Perfected Golden Immortal next to him, Vastly Martial suddenly relaxed. He then sneered and said, “Indeed, Golden Immortals do have some capabilities, but killing them is still a very easy thing to do.”</p><p>Chen Shaohua’s expression changed. He was keenly aware of the discolored expressions of the two Golden Immortals around him. The sight immediately gave birth to a bad hunch in his heart.</p><p>He knew that he likely ran into a troublesome matter.</p><p>However, he gritted his teeth and paced a few steps forwards and spoke in a heavy voice, “You may all powerhouses and are likely Perfected Golden Immortals. But this matter has nothing to do with the rest of the Great Tang Empire’s people. I admit that I’m not your opponent at all. I’ll hand over the Purple Diamond Alloy and you can kill all of us, but leave out the rest as they’re not involved!”</p><p>“Heh, what kind of shit is this Great Tang Empire, huh? A bunch of cowards?” Vastly Martial Nightwolf sneered.</p><p>He was about to strike after saying that when at the side, Nine Nether Swordmeister, whose expression turned strange, quickly raised his hand to stop him when he was about to attack. The fatty looked at Chen Shaohua and asked, “You said you’re the Great Tang Empire’s people? Is there anyone in the Great Tang Empire called the Great Tang Heavenly Emperor?”</p><p>Great Tang Heavenly Emperor?</p><p>Chen Shaohua knew that it was Tang Xiu’s alias in the Immortal World and replied indifferently, “He’s the Emperor of our Great Tang Empire.”</p><p>Nine Nether Swordmeister was stunned. He immediately shifted to the two Golden Immortals and asked, “You both were purchased by Great Tang Heavenly Emperor from the Convict Arena, weren’t you?”</p><p>One of them answered, “Indeed.”</p><p>Nine Nether Swordmeister let out a forced, wry smile and waved his hand. “Haih, Brother Vastly Martial, let’s cut this off and forget it, shall we? I’ll be a peacemaker here and give the Purple Diamond Alloy to this Great Tang Empire’s people.”</p><p>Vastly Martial Nightwolf was surprised and asked, “Brother Nine Nether, do you know this Great Tang Heavenly Emperor?”</p><p>“Not only do I know him, but I was also even the one who bought these two Golden Immortals from Convict Arena myself and gave them to Tang Lil Bro. Originally, he purchased a total of 20 late-stage Golden Immortals from Convict Arena.”</p><p>Gasp…</p><p>Incredulity painted Vastly Martial’s face and he blurted out in amazement, “Brother Nine Nether, what is the origin of this Great Tang Heavenly Emperor? To think that he was worth your…”</p><p>“Speaking about it, I’m very curious about Tang Lil Bro’s identity myself.” Nine Nether Swordmeister interrupted him. “But everyone has their own secrets. He was unwilling to disclose it to me, so I naturally didn’t force him. Further, I had a gamble with him before and didn’t expect that I’d actually lose to him. That’s why he’s also one of my foreign aids three months later.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
