Time itself didn’t have much meaning in the Immortal World because for many powerful Immortals, they could even spend years, decades, or centuries in seclusion…</p><p>A whole year and a half passed by.</p><p>When Tang Xiu and Gu Yan’er came back to the desolate planet, the pair exchanged glances and smiled to each other tacitly after seeing the stretch of humble camps set up there.</p><p>“Open.”</p><p>Tang Xiu opened the array covering the planet and appeared in the camp.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>Nine figures flickered and moved fast, three of whom appeared in front of Tang Xiu and looked happy after seeing Tang Xiu and Gu Yan’er.</p><p>“Lord!” Zhong Ling came floating and slightly nodded in salute with a beaming face.</p><p>“Anything happened here in the last one and half a year?” asked Tang Xiu.</p><p>“Some Immortals passed by nearby stars occasionally, but they didn’t find us here, so nothing happened,” Zhong Ling said. “Everybody has been fully immersed in cultivation these days and many of them have advanced.”</p><p>Tang Xiu nodded with a smile at her report. His gaze shifted as many more figures came from the distance to gather at his position. He immediately floated to the air up to 10 meters high and loudly spoke with a smile, “Everyone, we shall gather here again tomorrow!”</p><p>Ouyang Lulu moved lightning fast to Tang Xiu’s front. After hugging him happily, she inquisitively asked curiously, “Where shall we go next, then?”</p><p>“We gotta pick our pace to the Immortal Lyceum.” Tang Xiu smilingly answered.</p><p>“Is the Immortal Lyceum quite far from here?” asked Ouyang Lulu again.</p><p>“If our trip goes smoothly, we should be able to get there within 4 years, but the time will stretch should we encounter some unforeseen events on the way there,” Tang Xiu replied.</p><p>4 years?</p><p>After hearing the answer, Ouyang Lulu was not the only one shocked, but also the rest of the Great Tang Empire people. Only now could they imagine how vast this Immortal World was.</p><p>Whoosh…</p><p>Gu Xiaoxue instantly appeared before Tang Xiu. Suppressing her excited feeling, she asked, “Grand Master, Master, may I know who this person is?”</p><p>Tang Xiu introduced Kitty to everyone with a smiling face. Afterward, he pointed to Zhong Ling’s group of nine and said, “You should be able to determine who these good sisters of yours are. Their appearances may have changed, but their souls and auras haven’t.”</p><p>Kitty came to the nine females led by Zhong Ling and burst into tears after recognizing their auras and souls. Her Master, Tang Xiu, took good care of her in the past, but it was Zhong Ling’s group who took care of her the most.</p><p>Gu Xiaoxue approached Tang Xiu and hesitantly asked, “Grand Master, may I ask whether you or Master have had a good harvest after the trip? You see, the consumption of… um… our cultivation resource is much faster than expected.”</p><p>Tang Xiu couldn’t help but burst into laughter. “How impatient. You’re indeed the Minister of Finance, aren’t you? Well, it’s just natural that we got a big harvest.”</p><p>With that said, he waved his hand and a stream of roughly 2 million Immortal Stones and tens of Immortal Crystals quickly flew out and appeared in front of every member of the Great Tang Empire</p><p>“This is the currency in the Immortal World which is also a resource all the cultivators and Immortals alike can use. These Immortal Stones contain Immortal Force which you can absorb and refine to strengthen your cultivation. You can also use them to buy things you like here.”</p><p>After speaking, he sent everyone Immortal Crystals and continued, “As for this one, this is an Immortal Crystal, a grade higher resource than an Immortal Stone. One Immortal Crystal equals to 100 Immortal Stones, and it’s enough for your uses for some time. Each of you can have two for now. But later on, you can obtain your annual allotment for Immortal Stones and Crystals for which the Ministry of Finance and Ministry of Political Affairs will work together to formulate the allotment for these items annually. The difference in amount will depend on your positions and status. Only when you become stronger will you receive more and more salaries in the future.”</p><p>All members of the Great Tang Empire looked excited. They had already learned some common knowledge in the Immortal World back when they were still on Earth. Aside from cultivation in the last one year and a half, they also learned more about the Immortal World from Zhong Ling’s group of nine. And to them, the Immortal Stones and Crystals were precious treasures.</p><p>Shortly after, Tang Xiu took out 3 million more Immortal Crystals and handed them to Gu Xiaoxue, saying, “As the Minister of Finance, you are to manage these Immortal Crystals. But keep in mind to tell me should you face any financial problems in the future.”</p><p>Gu Xiaoxue used her spiritual sense to check the ring and an especially bright smile covered her face. She nodded repeatedly and said, “I’ll keep that in mind, Grand Master.”</p><p>Tang Xiu then glanced at all directions with a smiling face and asked aloud, “For your information, these Immortal Stones and Crystals are the most basic things. We also brought many other things.”</p><p>With that said, he took out more than 200,000 immortal swords, 200,000 set of armors from his interspatial ring and sent each person the set of a sword and an armor engraved with five-starred red, the flag of the Great Tang Empire.</p><p>Finally, he handed over a large number of other types of weapons, elixirs, talismans, array disks, and various cultivation resources to Gu Xiaoxue.</p><p>“So many…”</p><p>Despite having managed a colossal number of cultivation resources, Gu Xiaoxue felt like the number was worlds apart compared to the cultivation resources Tang Xiu just brought back. What shocked her the most was the half a million interspatial rings.</p><p>A day later.</p><p>Aside from Tang Xiu and Gu Yan’er, the rest had entered the Heavenly Abode immortal artifact brought by the pair. Since Tang Xiu had asked around about some things in the previous trip, he knew where to find the long-distance spatial teleportation array.</p><p>2 months later.</p><p>As Tang Xiu and Gu Yan’er landed on the highest peak of a continent, a gigantic spatial teleportation array came to their sight while hundreds of cultivators and Immortals were waiting near it.</p><p>A Golden Immortal dressed in silver combat armor and boots led 500 Immortals to guard around the spatial transmission array. Coldness and a killing aura radiated from them, and they brazenly killed any unruly individuals who tried to provoke them.</p><p>Tang Xiu himself had inquired and learned that the Immortal soldiers stationed in this spatial teleportation array belonged to the Iron Stallion Empire, the only empire in this continent. The said empire was rumored to have a lot of powerhouses, while its Emperor was a Perfected Golden Immortal expert.</p><p>“Pay the fare.”</p><p>The silver-armored general came to Tang Xiu and shot a cold look before he asked in a heavy voice, “1 Immortal Crystal for each person in the Heavenly Abode artifact, and 10 Immortal Crystals per person outside.”</p><p>Tang Xiu gave him over 200,000 Immortal Crystals and indifferently stated something that made the silver-armored general dumbfounded. “I know the rules, but you’re not qualified to carry out any inspection. These are all the Immortal Crystals for the said number. Not one piece less.”</p><p>“Please cooperate, Fellow Immortal,” the silver-armored general creased his brows and asked after he came to his senses.</p><p>Gu Yan’er came forward and let out her aura. Then, said lightly, “Are you sure you want to insist on inspecting us?”</p><p>The general’s breath skipped a beat and he immediately let out a bitter smile. “We’re under orders, Fellow Immortals. You… off you go then since it’s not convenient for you.”</p><p>He was not stupid. He knew that the other party had too many people. Who knew how many powerhouses were in that Heavenly Abode artifact? He didn’t dare to risk offending them given his own combat force. In case there was anyone with fearsome power among them and he successfully angered them, and they moved to kill him and his company, that would be far too great of a loss than any gain.</p><p>Further, these people were leaving this star domain. Regardless of who they were, it was already a great thing they wouldn’t be a threat to the Iron Stallion Empire, to begin with.</p><p>“Activate the spatial teleportation array in advance!”</p><p>The silver-armored general turned around and ordered aloud.</p><p>Tang Xiu and Gu Yan’er exchanged similar glances and entered the array. They were teleported away as a group as hundreds of cultivators and Immortals came flocking.</p><p>Aries Immortal Domain.</p><p>Celestial Aqua Immortal Doman.</p><p>Aquamarine Immortal Domain.</p><p>Senkadori Immortal Domain.</p><p>After 2 years on the road, they also leaped through space using five spatial teleportation arrays before finally leading all the members of the Great Tang Empire to the Scarlet Lotus Immortal Domain.</p><p>“Master, I feel like having some Scarlet Lotus Floe Porridge.”</p><p>The moment they stepped into the spatial teleportation array, a childish smile appeared on Gu Yan’er’s face while she intimately held Tang Xiu’s arm.</p><p>Past memories rewound in Tang Xiu’s mind. The 10-year-old Gu Yan’er took him to the Scarlet Lotus Immortal Doman and had the Scarlet Lotus Floe Porridge in Hessen Castle. The taste was not only unforgettable to her, but also to Tang Xiu himself.</p><p>That delicacy was genuinely delicious.</p><p>Tang Xiu let out a light smile and said, “Alright, let’s go there since you want to eat. Anyhow, if my memory serves me correctly, the spatial teleportation array of the Scarlet Lotus Domain leads to the Ivy Immortal Domain; that place isn’t far from Hessen Castle. Not to mention that our supply is dwindling, so we gotta buy some more.”</p><p>“Well, we may get some chances to get rich too,” Gu Yan’er smilingly replied.</p><p>Tang Xiu couldn’t help but burst into laughter. He never wanted to rob others of their wealth if it was not a last resort, though he didn’t mind such an action if those he robbed were wicked people, to begin with.</p><p>“Anyway, how about having some more experts to protect us, Yan’er?”</p><p>“Huh? What do you mean, Master?” asked Gu Yan’er with a surprise.</p><p>“The Scarlet Lotus Domain is quite chaotic, I’m sure you’ve witnessed it back when I took you here. It won’t be easy for the current us to ensure our safety given our present strength. That’s why I’ve been thinking of buying some deathmatch gladiators.” Tang Xiu slightly smiled.</p><p>Gu Yan’er quickly understood and replied, “If you really plan to buy some, then take some Golden Immortal gladiators. I don’t think we’d have a problem getting a colossal amount of Immortal Crystals given our abilities, either. It’s best that we buy hundreds of Golden Immortal gladiators by then, so we can ensure our safety.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
