Millions of troops of the Great Tang Empire teleported to all the domains in succession and awaited further orders.</p><p>At Heavenshold City in the Obsideum Immortal Domain.</p><p>Here existed a dazzling palace that embodied grandeur and majesty. At its summit towered a ten thousand meters long sword running up straight into the skies. Within it, the ruler of the Obsideum was currently sitting cross-legged in cultivation. Four Perfected Golden Immortal Stage experts sat cross-legged around him, continuously supplying him with a steady flow of Immortal Force.</p><p>Whoosh…</p><p>A Communication Signet flew into the palace, and one of the Perfected Golden Immortals reached out to grab it. After going through the information stored in the signet, his expression instantly changed. He stopped supplying Immortal Force and said in a low and deep voice, “Immortal Father, something has happened.”</p><p>Obsideum Immortal Father opened his eyes, a fierce glimmer flashing past his eyes as he raised his arm and floated up while saying in a deep voice, “What happened?”</p><p>The Perfected Golden Immortal answered, “A report has arrived from Outer Rain City to the east. It appears that three million immortal soldiers of the Great Tang Empire have surrounded the city. All the territories to the east of Outer Rain City have fallen into the Great Tang Empire’s hands too. According to the speculations of the War Fanatic City Lord, although the soldiers of the Great Tang Empire haven’t shown any signs of besieging the city yet, they appear to be waiting for someone’s orders. If they attack, Outer Rain City may fall into the enemy’s hands in less than half a day, and our men might get slaughtered to the last one.”</p><p>Obsideum Immortal Father revealed an infuriated expression as he said in a deep voice, “This Great Tang Empire has gone too far now. They took over the Immortal Lyceum a hundred years ago, and ever since then, they have harassed my Obsideum Immortal Domain with invasions. Their wicked and ambitious intentions are as clear as the skies.”</p><p>“Reporting.”</p><p>An anxious voice reached the hall from outside.</p><p>Obsideum Immortal Father furrowed his brows and, along with the four Perfected Golden Immortals, he appeared outside the hall. He then asked the black-robed muscular man in a stern voice, “What has happened again now?”</p><p>The muscular man answered, “Immortal Father, we just received news that the Great Tang Empire has launched a three-pronged attack. A total of eight million immortal soldiers altogether have attacked our Obsideum, Aeterneum, and Chalcedoneum Immortal Domains simultaneously. Aeterneum and Chalcedoneum are under attack by two million soldiers, while three million soldiers are attacking us. The defense of Outer Rain City crumbled in just a few minutes, and War Fanatic City Lord suffered heavy injuries. A subordinate rescued him while the others held back the enemy, and he’s rushing over to our Heavenshold City now.”</p><p>“What a quick speed.”</p><p>Obsideum Immortal Father’s expression morphed, and his killing intent grew stronger.</p><p>The expression of the Perfected Golden Immortal who received the Communication Signet turned extremely unsightly as he spoke in a deep voice, “Immortal Father, there’s definitely a powerful Perfected Golden Immortal among the three million soldiers of the Great Tang Empire that attacked Outer Rain City. It’s even possible there’s more than one of them. War Fanatic City Lord is a mid-stage Perfected Golden Immortal and possesses a formidable battle strength. Even a late-stage Perfected Golden Immortal might not be his opponent. However, he was heavily wounded in just a few minutes. This indicates that the enemy is far more powerful than what we have imagined.”</p><p>Obsideum Immortal Father nodded and said grimly, “Since the Great Tang Empire wants war, we shall give them one then. We’ll slaughter them all. Inform all the Immortals of Obsideum that those who wish to serve me have to rush to the Obsideum Mountain immediately. We shall face the Great Tang Empire’s legion in a battle over there.”</p><p>The Perfected Golden Immortal’s expression changed as he said in a worried voice, “Immortal Father, your injuries haven’t healed completely yet. If the other side were to have an expert of the Supremacy Stage, I fear…”</p><p>Obsideum Immortal Father said in a cold voice, “If the Great Tang Empire has a Supreme, there’s no need for us to fight them at all. We should simply surrender and hand over the Obsideum Immortal Domain to them. However, if they don’t have a Supreme, none of those three million immortal soldiers shall leave Obsideum alive!”</p><p>Two days later.</p><p>At Obsideum Mountain in Obsideum Immortal Domain.</p><p>The Obsideum Mountain that spanned a continuous landmass of several million kilometers had no flora at all, just had a pitiful amount of fauna. However, hundreds of thousands of Immortals were currently walking around to the west of the Obsideum Mountain. Some of them were in groups of threes or fours, while other groups consisted of hundreds that had banded together. All of their sights were currently focused on Obsideum Immortal Father, who was sitting cross-legged on the tallest stone platform right now.</p><p>Boom…</p><p>A fireball shot up to the sky from the hundred thousand Immortals and exploded into a massive cloud of fire.</p><p>In the next instant, Obsideum Immortal Father floated up in the air and gazed towards the east. His generals, the six Perfected Golden Immortals, Immortal Sovereign Northpeak, Lord Ferryman, Demon-Eyed Asura, Adina, War Fanatic, and Immortal Sovereign Tyro, appeared beside him one after another and looked towards the east as well.</p><p>Immortal Sovereign Northpeak said in a deep voice, “Immortal Father, according to the intel we have collected, the army of the Great Tang Empire constructs a spatial teleportation array as soon as they make their appearance. It appears that they have an Array Master among them.”</p><p>Obsideum Immortal Father answered him indifferently, “So what? If all the soldiers of the Great Tang Empire had come to attack us, we would have had to act a bit cautious. However, they actually attacked all three great Immortal Domains simultaneously. It’s really too audacious of them. We shall teach them the price of splitting up their troops when we meet them in battle later on.”</p><p>After he finished speaking, he turned back to look at the dozens of Immortal subordinates behind him and revealed a complacent expression. He was fond of instructing his subordinates, and as a result, he had ended up producing a large number of experts. These hundred thousand Immortals were his hidden ace.</p><p>Fifteen minutes later.</p><p>Immortal Sovereign Northpeak’s expression shifted as he commented in a deep voice, “They’re here.”</p><p>When Obsideum Immortal Father got a clear look at the overwhelming number of Great Tang Empire’s soldiers flying towards them, his expression morphed instantly. His eyes glimmered with disbelief as he let out a deep breath.</p><p>“What’s that?”</p><p>Immortal Sovereign Northpeak’s eyes filled with shock as he gazed upon the formation formed by the troops of the Great Tang Empire across the eastern skies. He had never seen such a shocking formation of Immortals in his eight-millennium life in the Immortal World.</p><p>Time zipped by, and when the entire three million-strong army of the Great Tang Empire appeared before the Obsideum Immortal Father and his hundred thousand-strong subordinates in a battle formation consisting of ten seemingly autonomous yet closely linked units, all of them revealed shocked expressions.</p><p>Obsideum Immortal Father’s expression turned extremely unsightly. Although he was a Supremacy Stage expert, the battle formation of the Great Tang Empire shook him to the core. This formation formed of Immortals was entirely adopted from the mortal world’s empires, and even though they were tens of kilometers away from the Obsideum Immortal Father, he could feel their oppressive aura that seemed to faintly carry the scent of blood—he felt goosebumps all over.</p><p>“Can… they even be considered Immortals? They’re simply a killing machine,” Immortal Sovereign Northpeak muttered with a somewhat pale face.</p><p>His words caused the other five Perfected Golden Immortals to reveal tense expressions. Their gazes were finally dithered at the war chariot being pulled by nine flood dragons at the center of the Great Tang Empire’s army. They could clearly see a young man donned in battle armor with the insignia of a dragon standing on this war chariot, and beside him stood a grim-faced middle-aged man in an upright posture, looking straight ahead while holding a command flag.</p><p>Whoosh…</p><p>A strange voice resounded from the command flag. When the Great Tang Empire’s soldiers saw that the command flag had changed directions, all of them stopped in an orderly fashion.</p><p>Tang Xiu had personally taken part in the expedition this time. He revealed a sneering look when he saw the familiar face of Obsideum Immortal Father. He had interacted with the Obsideum Immortal Father on multiple occasions before. Although they weren’t friends, they weren’t enemies. However, the Obsideum Immortal Father had failed to pay back the favor he owed until now.</p><p>Obsideum Immortal Father felt shaken by the Great Tang Empire’s legion before him, so he took a deep breath to pacify the shock in his heart. He then flew a few kilometers ahead and spoke to Tang Xiu in a deep voice, “You’re the commander who the Great Tang Empire has sent to invade my Obsideum Immortal Domain?”</p><p>Tang Xiu flew up and answered in a loud voice, “I’m not just the commander, I’m also the Great Tang Heavenly Emperor, the emperor of the Great Tang Empire. Obsideum Immortal Father, your famed name and reputation have reached my ears too! It’s a wonder to meet you in person now.”</p><p>Obsideum Immortal Father felt wholly shocked as he responded loudly, “So you’re the Great Tang Heavenly Emperor who demonstrated extraordinary talent in the Secret Palace of the Drunken Immortal Supreme. However, are you unaware that I am a Supreme? Did you believe you can defeat me with just the soldiers of your Great Tang Empire?”</p><p>Tang Xiu replied indifferently, “Let’s not even mention the fact that you are injured. Even if you weren’t, you and your motley group of trash is nothing much to my Great Tang Empire. However, since you have already broken through to the Supremacy Stage and also have a few Perfected Golden Immortals beside you, I will give you two options. Surrender to me, and live, or oppose me, and die.”</p><p>Obsideum Immortal Father sneered at him. “Although your Great Tang Empire’s soldiers look good on the outside, I wonder how their strength actually fares! Since you wish to fight, you shall have one then! We shall know who the final winner is once the battle ends. I hope you have strong people at your side to protect you, or else, don’t blame me for beheading and exterminating you in flesh and soul.”</p><p>Tang Xiu turned towards Chen Shaohua, who held the command flag and nodded. Immediately afterward, Cheng Shaohua signaled the troops to attack using the flag.</p><p>In the next instant, the first two units of thirty thousand soldiers activated their immortal defensive artifacts simultaneously. In just a few moments, an absolute defensive system had formed between them. The other four units of thirty thousand soldiers, a total of one hundred and twenty soldiers, all took out immortal crossbow artifacts and nocked their arrows on them. They shot at the Immortals of the Obsideum Immortal Domain along with the signal of the flag.</p><p>Arrows overshadowed the entire sky as they shot towards the enemies like a flood.</p><p>Obsideum Immortal Father’s expression morphed, and he rushed to take out an immortal defensive artifact. The immortal shield grew in size instantly and tried to block all the arrows. However, the moment the leading arrow touched the immortal shield, it ended up exploding along with a thunderous sound.</p><p>Boooom…</p><p>The brutal explosions smashed apart the immortal shield into bits and pieces in an instant, and a volley of countless arrows cleansed through this space, leaving utter chaos in their wake.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
