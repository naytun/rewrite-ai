It was true respect from their hearts, not superficial at all. It was well known that Venerable Bella Fern Regalia had yet to become a Supreme when Star Cultivation Great Emperor was still around. Yet, she put down all the restraints of being a woman and actively and bravely pursued him. No matter how many times she was rejected, she still persisted and persevered.</p><p>Being so brave and persistent in her love. There were many inspiring love stories in the Immortal World, but none of those could compare with the love story shown by Venerable Bella Fern Regalia that was worth their admiration. Especially after Star Cultivation Great Emperor was gone after failing his tribulation. She went so far as to help the family of Star Cultivation Great Emperor, experiencing brutal bloody battles, again and again, wandering on the edge of life and death time and again.</p><p>It could be said that the Vermillion Bird Holy Sect would have ended up more miserable if it weren’t for the help of Venerable Bella Fern Regalia. Even after she had broken through to the Supremacy Stage, she forced the Inner Pill Sect and the Everlasting Palace to temporarily cancel their onslaught and only trapped the Vermillion Bird Holy Sect’s people in their territory.</p><p>“Greetings, Supreme Bella Fern Regalia.”</p><p>The five men cupped their fists and bowed to salute.</p><p>“Everyone, I may have advanced to the Supremacy Stage, but I still like my previous title, so keep addressing me as Venerable Bella in the future!” said Bella lightly.</p><p>“By your words!” the five men respectfully replied.</p><p>Bella then shifted to Tang Xiu and asked, “What did you run into that made you so happy?”</p><p>Tang Xiu slightly smiled and took out 4 million Crystal Essences from his interspatial ring. He smiled at Wandering Slayer and said, “I have to thank you for your help a while ago, Venerable Wandering Slayer. Please take these Crystal Essences as reimbursement for what you spent in exchange for giving me the Immortal Soul of Argent Martial Hale.”</p><p>Venerable Wandering Slayer had just put Argent Martial Hale’s Immortal Soul into a Soul-refining container, but now he took out the Soul-refining container and directly handed it to Tang Xiu. “Those 4 million Crystal Essences are worth nothing to me. Besides, us brothers are also very disgusted with this traitor. This guy has smeared the reputation of Star Cultivation Great Emperor, so forget about it.”</p><p>But Tang Xiu insisted and reasoned with all seriousness. “You give an amount and return it in a similar fashion. I’m already grateful for your help, so please, you must take these Crystal Essences.”</p><p>“This…” Venerable Wandering Slayer turned to Bella.</p><p>“Alright, take it since he insists,” said Bella with a light smile. “Besides, we don’t like to owe too many to anyone.”</p><p>With that said, she grabbed and held Tang Xiu’s arm, her smile turning more brilliant.</p><p>“You both…”</p><p>Venerable Wandering Slayer’s pupils shrunk with disbelief. The other four men also reacted like him, as though they were looking at the most incredible thing in the world.</p><p>“Remember that Great Tang Heavenly Emperor is my archenemy since he snatched my Immortal Lyceum, understood?” said Bella lightly.</p><p>Venerable Wandering Slayer’s group of five exchanged glances and then understood the meaning of Bella’s words immediately. After a moment of silence, the five men immediately vowed an Immortal Oath. Shortly after, Wandering Slayer said with all seriousness, “I promise you that within a month at most, the entire Immortal World will know that there’s a bloody feud between Great Tang Heavenly Emperor and Venerable Bella Fern Regalia.”</p><p>“Alright, one day in the future, the five of you must come to the Great Tang Empire and I’ll explain to you the insights of how to break through to the Supremacy Stage,” said Bella happily.</p><p>“Thank you!” The five men were shocked but happily surprised.</p><p>Tang Xiu calmly smiled and said, “We were destined to meet each other today, so why don’t you guys prepare some drinks for us?”</p><p>“Hahaha. You didn’t shut us out, Great Tang Heavenly Emperor, so please come and have a taste of my Azure Bamboo Immortal Wine. Let’s drink happily. Hey, some of you come here and bring my Azure Bamboo wine! Also, you are not to leave my place if you don’t get drunk first, Great Tang Heavenly Emperor!”</p><p>For two whole days, Tang Xiu drank with them to their heart’s content while chatting about the situation in the Immortal World. Bella herself and Sablefiend Scorpio just stayed by his side and did not interfere with the happy drinking event between Tang Xiu and the five Perfected Golden Immortals. Finally, Goldenray old freak was the first to get drunk, and the other five, including Tang Xiu, finally got dead drunk as well.</p><p>7 days later, when Tang Xiu woke up from his lethargic sleep, he found himself sleeping in Bella’s lap on a fast-moving carriage. The whole sky was filled with the sunset light and red clouds, and the mysterious scene of the world looked so charming and extraordinarily picturesque.</p><p>“How long have I slept and where are we now?” Tang Xiu rubbed his pained head and asked right after he took a seat.</p><p>“It’s been 7 days. We’re only three regions away from the Immortal Lyceum region. We should be back home a few days later,” answered Bella with a smile.</p><p>“So fast?” blurted Tang Xiu in surprise.</p><p>“Well, Sablefiend Scorpio obtained a treasure garb back when she was in the Secret Palace of Drunken Immortal Supreme. She gave it to me, so we can now move faster,” said Bella.</p><p>“What treasure is it?” asked Tang Xiu.</p><p>“Lightflow Wing,” answered Bella with a smile.</p><p>Tang Xiu was surprised and said, “Rumors have it that this streamer wing, the Lightflow Wing, was once obtained by Drunken Immortal Supreme and then disappeared after he ascended to the God Realm. It’s such a great treasure that it can at least double the speed of whoever obtains it. Be it for traveling or killing, it’s an absolute trump card.”</p><p>“I’ll give you the Lightflow Wing after we arrive at the Immortal Lyceum, Xiu,” said Bella with a smile.</p><p>“No, that Lightflow Wing will play a greater role with you using it.” Tang Xiu shook his head. “Besides, our Great Tang Empire is planning to expand its territory and occupy many large Immortal Domains, so we’ll need a powerhouse like you at the helm. The first stage of the Great Tang Empire’s development should be completed within a century, with which we’ll lay a solid foundation. A century later, it will be the time when our Great Tang Empire will fully blast out!”</p><p>“Only a few centuries? Isn’t it too hasty?” asked Bella with hesitation.</p><p>“I don’t think so,” replied Tang Xiu with a smile. “I have provided a massive number of cultivation resources. If we fail to lay a solid foundation, that means the people of the Great Tang Empire are just incompetent. You must know that I have prepared many things, namely various cultivation resources which are absolutely many times more than other forces.”</p><p>“But the most important aspect to a deep foundation such as those super forces is the number of Golden Immortals and Perfected Golden Immortals,” said Bella. “Do you think the Great Tang Empire can have a large number of Golden Immortals and Perfected Golden Immortals within a few hundred years?”</p><p>“You know, the Great Tang Empire already has more than a dozen Perfected Golden Immortals now,” said Tang Xiu calmly, “As for the number of Golden Immortals, well… we’ll have at least tens of thousands of them within a century.”</p><p>“Come again?!” Bella’s eyes were full of disbelief. It must be noted that even the most powerful force would only have roughly 10,000 or even 5,000 Golden Immortals. What kind of heritage did the Great Tang Empire have that tens of thousands of Golden Immortals could emerge within a century?</p><p>“Bella, you have yet to learn much about the situation of our Great Tang Empire,” said Tang Xiu with a smile. “You’ll understand a lot when we go back. What I can tell you now is that we have more than 30,000 Monster Immortals with terrifyingly deep foundations. Let alone advancing to the Golden Immortal Stage, if you give them enough time and teach them suitably in their cultivation, most of them will face no issue in advancing to the Perfected Golden Immortal Stage.”</p><p>Gasp…</p><p>That was something unimaginable to Bella. Where did Tang Xiu find so many Monster Immortals? Her scalp went numb upon imagining that the Great Tang Empire would have 10,000-20,000 Perfected Golden Immortals in their ranks. At that time, just relying on this force, they would likely be able to sweep over the whole Immortal World, right?</p><p>“Bella, halt our advance.” Tang Xiu suddenly ordered.</p><p>Bella froze for a moment. She observed the surroundings first. After stopping, she looked bewildered and asked, “Why?”</p><p>“We rescued Dao Master Qing Feng and Undemonized Sovereign Mo on the way back. They are now inside the Heavenly Abode artifact. We’re about to return to the Immortal Lyceum region, so we have to let them leave for now. I don’t want to expose my identity too soon,” explained Tang Xiu.</p><p>Bella quickly understood and nodded with a smile. “Ah, I see. Saving them is indeed for a good reason.”</p><p>The moment after, Dao Master Qing Feng and Undemonized Sovereign Mo came out of the Heavenly Abode artifact. They now looked much better even though they had yet to fully recover from their injuries. At least, they were now able to go all-out should they encounter another crisis.</p><p>“Gentlemen, I’m going back to the Great Tang Empire soon and I can’t take you with me on the way. May I know what do you plan to do next?” asked Tang Xiu with a smile.</p><p>“I’ve discussed it with Undemonized Sovereign Mo before. I may have escaped from danger, but the Everlasting Palace will likely vent their anger on my Pristine Immortal Confucian Sect. I reckon that a large number of powerhouses will storm my sect to demand something. That’s why I must hurry back. If the Everlasting Palace people do come to my sect, we’ll definitely get into a big fight with them at the worst.”</p><p>“Well, I’ve been living like a drifter, so I have no fixed place to live, to begin with. I’ve made up my mind to follow Qing Feng back to his sect as a guest. Let’s just say that I found a safe place to heal myself first,” said Sovereign Mo lightly.</p><p>“You’re really great. At least you’re not afraid to brave dangers and make great sacrifices for the sake of your friends.” Tang Xiu gave his thumbs up and exclaimed in praise, “Anyway, since you are decided, I won’t be able to accompany you any longer. But both of you are always welcome to visit my Great Tang Empire. Let’s have some drinks by then.”</p><p>“That’s for sure!”</p><p>“There will be a chance for that, sure!”</p><p>The two men cupped their fists one after another and then quickly left under the gaze of Tang Xiu’s group.</p><p>Tang Xiu then summoned Jing Xian’er from the Heavenly Abode artifact. Then, he pointed to Bella and said, “You want to follow us to the Immortal Lyceum, so I’m giving you to Venerable Bella to serve as her maid! Serve her well and you’ll definitely benefit in the future.”</p><p><em>Me? Becoming a maid?</em></p><p>Jing Xian’er’s face turned a bit cold and she replied with a bit of anger, “Great Tang Heavenly Emperor, I’m not going to be someone’s maid. I’m going to be a disciple of Sablefiend Scorpio!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
