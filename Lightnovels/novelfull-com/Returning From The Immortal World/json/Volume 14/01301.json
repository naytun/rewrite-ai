He believed that Tang Xiu wouldn’t lie to him regarding this matter since the immortal swords, armors, and other weapons Tang Xiu had ordered were still in his sect.</p><p>“Where exactly are you heading to, Great Tang Immortal friend? Would you like me to accompany you?”</p><p>“It’s not worth your trouble, I think.” Tang Xiu waved and said, “I just paid 200,000 Immortal Crystals to your Aurelian Artificer Sect and that made me a poor man again. For that reason, I’ve been thinking that the Clearwater Clan should be nearby, yes? We’re going there. Hopefully, they are not as poor as us.”</p><p>Darknorth Immortal’s eyes gleamed and he replied in a deep voice, “My sect naturally won’t interfere too much if you’re going somewhere else, Great Tang Immortal friend. But I’m kind of hoping that you can give the opportunity for my sect to get revenge if you’re going to the Clearwater Clan. You can rest assured, you can have all their wealth.”</p><p>Tang Xiu creased his brows and said, “But your Aurelian Artificer Sect needs to focus your attention on refining now, no? In case…”</p><p>“My sect has a total of 4 Golden Immortal ancestors. All of them going with you won’t waste too much time. Half a month should be enough, I think,” replied Darknorth Immortal.</p><p>Tang Xiu ruminated for a while and then nodded. “Stopping you from having your revenge is rather inappropriate. Alright, let’s go together, then! But I’m going to give you all the wealth gained from the Clearwater Clan in exchange for the weapons of the save value.”</p><p>“It’s a deal!” Dakrnorth Immortal laughed happily.</p><p>He hated the Clearwater Clan. After all, he almost died in their hands. Even if he was now occupied and unable to eliminate the Clearwater Clan, sending several Golden Immortal ancestors there would serve the same purpose.</p><p>Suddenly, Tang Xiu’s expression shifted. He then looked at and spoke to Gu Yan’er, “Yan’er, you are to go with the Aurelian Artificer Sect’s ancestors later. I’ll be staying here to refine some things.”</p><p>Gu Yan’er didn’t refute Tang Xiu’s decision and nodded smilingly. “Then wait for good news from me, Master.”</p><p>Eventually, Gu Yan’er left with the four ancestors of Aurelian Artificer Sect while Tang Xiu stayed under the warm hospitality of Darknorth Immortal.</p><p>At the Scarlet Cliff Abode.</p><p>This cave abode had long been the assigned residence for all generations of Sect Masters of the Aurelian Artificer Sect. It was also the best place for refining since the cave had Earth Vein magma and a handful of Nine Yang Purple Flame that was born in the Earth Vein Magma, which made it a great spot for refining. The quality of any artifacts refined in this cave abode would be at least a level higher even though the materials and the artifact refined were the same due to the existence of the Nine Yang Purple Flame.</p><p>Strictly speaking, the iron rule of the Aurelian Artificer Sect itself forbade the Scarlet Cliff Abode to open for any outsider. But after a discussion between Darknorth Immortal and the four ancestors, they finally decided to provide the place to Tang Xiu for his refining due to three reasons. The first reason was the masterpiece scripture of the sect given to them by Tang Xiu’s elder. The second was because of a life-saving grace since Tang Xiu rescued Darknorth Immortal and Darknorth Everblithe. And the third one was because they wanted to see Tang Xiu’s expertise level on refining.</p><p>Inside the blazing hot Scarlet Cliff Abode, Tang Xiu was guided by Darknorth Immortal and then listed some materials for refining. But when Darknorth Immortal got the list of the refining materials, there was no other expression on his face except for a bitter smile.</p><p>“These three types of materials, the Lucid Sky Sand, Red Pure Gold, and Indigo Peng Tendon are extremely precious and rare treasures. Let alone my Aurelian Artificer Sect, I don’t think there’s anyone in the Riversky Outer Domain who has these them. Great Tang Immortal friend, is it possible to replace them with other materials?” Darknorth Immortal asked with a bitter smile on his ashamed face. Yet, he suddenly remembered a record of his sect’s history. Previously, <em>that</em> mysterious powerhouse, who was also this Great Tang Heavenly Emperor’s ancestor, also needed some refining materials when he came to his sect. Eventually, the elders of his sect weren’t able to provide them since they had never heard of such materials.</p><p>A disappointed look flashed in Tang Xiu’s eyes. “What other materials do you have in your sect, then? Let me see them! But please spare me from trashy materials.”</p><p>Darknorth Immortal hesitated before eventually nodding. His sect did have several extremely precious refining materials, but the value of those materials was enough to give anyone a shock. But he had confidence and trust that Tang Xiu wouldn’t misappropriate the precious refining materials of his sect for no reason.</p><p>“Come with me.”</p><p>After taking a deep breath, Darknorth Immortal walked for hundreds of meters before stopping in front of a cave wall. He then cast a spell and the wall suddenly split and revealed a corridor enough for two people walking side-by-side.</p><p>The path led to a secret room in the interior.</p><p>As Tang Xiu entered the secret room, his eyes swept through the tens of spots covered by transparent shields. Immediately after, a look of surprise suddenly painted his face the moment his eyes landed on a soccer-sized area in the inner corner, where he saw an ore radiating yellow light.</p><p><em>An Earth Core?</em></p><p>Tang Xiu subconsciously walked towards it and muttered to himself before he stood in front of the shield.</p><p>Darknorth Immortal looked confused. He shifted to Tang Xiu and asked, “Great Tang Immortal friend, do you know something about this material?”</p><p>Tang Xiu looked at the bewildered Darknorth Immortal and asked incredulously, “You had no idea about this material at all?”</p><p>Dakrnorth Immortal shook his head and forced a wry smile. “No, I don’t know about it. It’s not just me, but the four ancestors of my sect have no idea about it, either. To be honest, this object has very strong compatibility with other attributed objects. Even materials with Yin and Yang properties can be combined together in the refining process, resulting in excellent compatibility and harmony. That’s the reason we concluded that this ore is very precious, so we put it here as a treasure.”</p><p>Tang Xiu felt helpless. Such a supreme treasure was only used for compatibility and harmonizing roles in the Aurelian Artificer Sect. That was simply wasting a treasure.</p><p>This was an Earth Core, for God’s sake! This object could only be obtained from a planet that had a very rich Earth element that had gone through the baptism of time for millions of years before it ultimately formed the essence of its source. Once such Earth Core was formed, an Immortal on that planet would reach divinity and ascend to become a deity. In other words, this object was something like a living organism and a companion for deities!</p><p>If this object were to be known to other Immortals, bloodbath and carnage would inevitably sweep over the Immortal World; even terrifying existences such as Supremes would participate in the crazy struggles. Had Tang Xiu encountered such a gigantic Earth Core previously, he wouldn’t have met his death directly even though he was sneak attacked by those damned Supremes who were supposed to be his friends back then. It was very likely that he could get a chance to make a comeback.</p><p>With a curious face, Darknorth Immortal asked, “Great Tang Immortal friend, you haven’t told me, what exactly is this thing?”</p><p>Tang Xiu took a deep breath and replied with all seriousness, “This object is a wonderful treasure that even those terrifying great figures want to own for themselves. Darknorth Immortal, I hope you can sell it to me.”</p><p>“About this…”</p><p>Darknorth Immortal looked awkward and forced a wry smile. “Great Tang Immortal friend, my sect only has a few precious refining materials and we also need this object for compatibility catalyst in refining some artifacts, else it would be impossible for us to refine them. What you ask… is beyond our power to satisfy.”</p><p>“Every object has a price, the only problem is its number,” Tang Xiu replied after ruminating for a while. “I won’t hide the truth from you. This object is very precious, but it’s completely a waste in your hands, so it’s much better to sell it to me. I’m even willing to spend a lot to buy this thing.”</p><p>“The price is so high?” Darknorth Immortal forced a smile and replied, “You don’t seem to have much Immortal Stones or Crystals, right? Do you want to exchange it with something else, by chance?”</p><p>Tang Xiu was silent for a moment before he quickly took out an interspatial ring and said, “This ring has 500,000 Immortal Crystals, nearly all my wealth. If you think that my offer is not enough, I still have 20 million Immortal Stones, which should be worth 200,000 Immortal Crystals. Such an amount of wealth should be enough to buy it.”</p><p>Now, Darknorth Immortal was slack-jawed in shock. He stared blankly at Tang Xiu and incredulously said, “You can still take out so many Immortal Stones and Crystals? What have you done in the past few months, exactly? Did you… happen to loot some treasure vaults of those super big sects or something?”</p><p>“We got some Auric Profusion Sources and sold them to the Celestial Vine Pavilion,” Tang Xiu replied. “You also know the price of this Auric Profusion Source, don’t you?”</p><p>Darknorth Immortal’s expression changed and he hurriedly inquired. “The Auric Profusion Source? How many of them did you obtain? Oh God! That thing is the most precious object all the immortals dream of having. That’s not something like us can buy with any amount of money in this Immortal Domain!”</p><p>A strange glint flashed in Tang Xiu’s eyes and he asked, “Do you perhaps need this Auric Profusion Source?”</p><p>“Of course, we need it!” Darknorth Immortal exclaimed. “If I can get the Auric Profusion Gold, I’m certain I can break through to the Golden Immortal late-stage within the next millennium and hopefully reach the Perfected Golden Immortal Stage later on. Great Tang Immortal friend… y-you… h-how about selling this precious treasure? If you’re willing, I will buy the next one you want to sell even if I must spend all my wealth!”</p><p>“Which one is more important to you, Auric Profusion Source or 700,000 Immortal Crystals, then?” Tang Xiu asked with a strange tone.</p><p>“That Auric Profusion Source is, of course, much more important!” Darknorth Immortal blurted out without hesitation. “You can find a way to get Immortal Crystals, but missing an Auric Profusion Source is a chance that is very difficult to come by again!”</p><p>Tang Xiu himself was perfectly aware of the huge temptation of the Auric Profusion Source to the slightly weaker Immortals, but he never expected that the temptation would be so great. He suddenly felt that he sold the Auric Profusion Source for too low of a price to the Celestial Vine Pavilion.</p><p>He then shook his head and threw the thought away from his mind before looking back at Dakrnorth Immortal. “I won’t take advantage of you. I’ll give you 2 Auric Profusion Sources and you give me this object. Do we have a deal?”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>Darknorth Immortal was taken aback and dumbfounded. He never thought that Tang Xiu still had some more Auric Profusion Sources. Most importantly, he already said that the Auric Profusion Source was much more important than 700,000 Immortal Crystals in his eyes, yet Tang Xiu was still willing to take out 2 portions and trade them with him!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
