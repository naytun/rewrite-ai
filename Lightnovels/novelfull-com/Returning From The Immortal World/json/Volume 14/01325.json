Watching the indifferent expressions of the two Perfected Golden Immortals, Tang Xiu slowly took out a cigarette, lit it up, and took a puff before saying, “You two must be thinking that I’m even worse than an ant since I’m just an ordinary Immortal, right?”</p><p>“We dare not have such a thought, Master.”</p><p>Both men shook their heads and denied even though it was exactly their thoughts since their lives were in Tang Xiu’s hands.</p><p>“You know, I don’t like subordinates who act respectful but against their mind and those who talk insincerely,” said Tang Xiu lightly. “Just answer me truthfully. Is that right?”</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>Zenith Venerable and Seaway Monarch answered at the same time.</p><p>Tang Xiu nodded with satisfaction and said, “Then, you both answer me another question. How long did it take you from the time you started to cultivate to the present?”</p><p>“6,432 years,” answered Zenith Venerable.</p><p>“5,320 years for me,” Seaway Monarch said.</p><p>“You should still remember how long it took you to reach the Immortal Stage from the first time you stepped on the cultivation path, right? Tell me about it,” Tang Xiu asked again.</p><p>Zenith Venerable and Seaway Monarch looked at each other. They faintly realized the direction of Tang Xiu’s question and suddenly sneered inwardly. They used to be peerless geniuses in their respective Immortal Domains and their cultivation speed was many times faster than others.</p><p>“This subordinate only took 423 years,” said Zenith Venerable.</p><p>“It took only 399 years for this subordinate,” said Seaway Monarch.</p><p>“Just so-so, but not bad either.” Tang Xiu nodded and said, “But do you know how long I have been on the cultivation path?”</p><p>Both men shook their heads at the same time.</p><p>“It took me less than 30 years,” said Tang Xiu indifferently.</p><p>“Pardon?!”</p><p>Incredulity painted the two men’s faces as they exclaimed.</p><p>They were both Perfected Golden Immortals and their state of mind was heaven-defying. Yet, Tang Xiu’s statement still shocked them to the core. It was because they never heard of anyone reaching the Immortal Stage from a mortal in less than 30 years. Not even those Supremacy Stage experts of ancient times were able to achieve such a feat. Even in the past hundreds of thousands of years, those who became Immortals within a hundred years could be counted with two hands, right?</p><p>“No need to be that shocked. Also, you don’t need to suspect me of having any noble bloodline eighter,” said Tang Xiu lightly. “I’m just an ordinary person, and it only took me less than 30 years to become an Immortal from birth to the present. Now, you both should understand what I want to say, shouldn’t you?”</p><p>Zenith Venerable and Seaway Monarch exchanged glances again. Although they were still a bit unable to accept and believe it, their attitudes changed a lot and they replied with a bit of respect, “We understand. Master’s aptitude is definitely against the heavens, more terrifying than any peerless genius in the past. Over time, I believe Master can become stronger and cultivate faster.”</p><p>Tang Xiu faintly smile and said, “It’s great that you understand it, so I’m going to talk to you openly and honestly today. I want to tell you that if you do your duty to the best of your abilities under me, you’ll only need to pledge your loyalty to me for 5,000 years. You’ll have your freedom after that.”</p><p>“5,000 years?”</p><p>Both men smiled bitterly at the same time. They were already very old now. Who could guarantee that they were still alive for another 5,000 years?</p><p>“I’ll provide both of you enormous cultivation resources during these 5,000 years, and I won’t restrict your freedom too much,” added Tang Xiu lightly. “Your lives may be under my control, but I’ll give you the respect you deserve during these 5,000 years. I can even elevate your status to a new height and even become the Protector of the Great Tang Empire.”</p><p>Both men looked confused.</p><p>“To be honest with you, I just ascended to the Immortal World for some time and led my people here,” Tang Xiu added lightly. “The number of people in the entire Great Tang Empire is but a few as there are only 200,000 plus people now.”</p><p>“We agree!”</p><p>The two men agreed but couldn’t help but smile bitterly inwardly. An empire consisting only of 200,000 people? It was just something they were powerless to even speak about. Even in an ordinary human country, the country’s population could surely exceed 10 million people, right? Yet this guy dared call it an empire?</p><p>Suddenly, the two men realized something else. Since their Master just arrived in the Immortal World not long ago, then where did he get so much wealth? They knew that he just bought 3 Perfected Golden Immortal gladiators in one go.</p><p>“May I ask you a question, Master?” Seaway Venerable hesitated a bit before he asked prudently.</p><p>“Ask me anything,” said Tang Xiu.</p><p>“You said you originally came from a small world, Master. Does the world you come from have a lot of Immortal Stones, Immortal Crystals and Crystal Essences? Else, where did so much wealth come from since you can buy us from the Convict Arena?” asked Seaway Monarch.</p><p>“Where else aside from the Convict Arena itself? Isn’t it a place for patrons to gamble?” Tang Xiu smiled faintly. “I can buy you guys from the Convict Arena. Can’t I also win a lot of wealth from there?”</p><p>Gasp…</p><p>The two men gasped and experienced an enormous shock.</p><p>Despite being Perfected Golden Immortals themselves, wanting to win hundreds of millions of Immortal Crystals from the Convict Arena was a very difficult thing to achieve. After all, not only one would need a terrifying vision, but heaven-defying luck was also needed if one wanted to win every gamble.</p><p>Tang Xiu took out 2 million Crystal Essences from his interspatial ring and handed them to the two men, saying, “I have a mission for you both. The mission is to kill an enemy who has just become a Perfected Golden Immortal. But keep in mind that you’re not to reveal your identities. Withdraw immediately after you kill him.”</p><p>“Who is this person?” asked Seaway Monarch.</p><p>“Vastly Martial Nightwolf, the Patriarch of the Nightwolf Clan in this Hessen Castle Immortal Domain,” said Tang Xiu.</p><p>“We both will surely get it done, Master,” said Seaway Monarch respectfully.</p><p>“Remember, you only have a very short time to act because this Vastly Martial guy knows Nine Nether Swordmeister,” said Tang Xiu. “I presume you’ve heard the name of Nine Nether Swordmeister too. He’s also in Hessen Castle as of now and he’s a good friend of this Vastly Martial guy. Therefore, strike with an irresistible force and withdraw before Nine Nether Swordmeister catches the news.”</p><p>“Understood!” both men respectfully replied and Tang Xiu then sent them out of the Heavenly Abode.</p><p>Afterward, Tang Xiu took a deep breath. When he came out of the Heavenly Abode artifact, he saw Gu Yan’er quietly savoring her tea, while Star Tears stood still in the room wearing an indifferent expression.</p><p>“Come inside.”</p><p>Tang Xiu opened the Heavenly Abode and brought Star Tears inside.</p><p>Star Tears calmly observed Tang Xiu and asked serenely, “Do you have any instructions for me, Master?”</p><p>Tang Xiu took out 2 million Crystal Essences and put them in an interspatial ring. Then, he threw it to her and said, “You don’t need to call me Master from now on. My name is Great Tang Heavenly Emperor. You can call me Your Majesty.”</p><p>“Great Tang Heavenly Emperor?… Your Majesty?”</p><p>Star Tears looked confused before she nodded slowly.</p><p>“I’m the Emperor of the Great Tang Empire. My country may have no territory and our number is just little more than 200,000 people as of now. But from now on, you are the Teacher and Protector of the State. I’ll provide you cultivation resources and you only need to promise 3 issues to me.”</p><p>“Please elaborate.” Star Tears slightly nodded.</p><p>“You are to change your appearance from today on and never let everyone else see your current face,” said Tang Xiu. “If you ask the reason, I will tell you. I’m now too weak and I can’t protect my Perfected Golden Immortal subordinates. You became a deathmatch fighter in the Convict Arena, meaning you have some powerful enemies. I don’t want to be implicated because of you.”</p><p>“I understand.”</p><p>Star Tears didn’t speak much and silently nodded. As her facial muscles jittered, her appearance quickly changed. As of now, it was impossible for anyone to identify her true identity unless they were people very close to her.</p><p>“The second one. You are to obey my orders unconditionally from now on,” said Tang Xiu again. “Certainly, I won’t send you to your death deliberately, and I will also give you a lot of freedom and… respect. But you must put your past behind you temporarily and serve me wholeheartedly.”</p><p>“Must I restrain myself when I encounter my mortal enemies?” asked Star Tears.</p><p>“That’s right. Even if you encounter your mortal enemies, you must hold back and not show any flaws and traces whatsoever.” Tang Xiu confirmed. “Certainly, you can still tell me and I’ll act depending on the situation. If we can deal with your enemies without causing me any trouble, I don’t mind letting you deal with them, or I’ll send some others to do it for you.”</p><p>Star Tears’ eyes lit up and she asked in a deep voice, “Can I take your words seriously?”</p><p>“I meant what I said,” said Tang Xiu firmly.</p><p>Star Tears nodded firmly and said, “Then I give you my promise.”</p><p>With a satisfied look, Tang Xiu added, “For the third issue, I haven’t thought about it yet. But I’ll tell you when I do so. For the time being, stay and cultivate in the Heavenly Abode artifact. If you have nothing to do, you can help me train the Great Tang Empire’s soldiers in the Heavenly Abode.”</p><p>“Acknowledged!” Star Tears nodded.</p><p>The moment after, Tang Xiu hesitated for a while and observed the renewed vigor in Star Tears’ eyes. Then, he slowly said, “Since you’re someone on our side from now on, once this Tang Xiu becomes a powerhouse who can contend with you, you can have your freedom back. At that time, I’ll respect your choice whether you want to leave or stay.”</p><p>Star Tears’ expression drastically changed after the last statement and incredulity filled her eyes. Her figure quickly retreated backward a few steps and she stutteringly asked, “You… w-what did you call yourself just now?”</p><p>“Great Tang Heavenly Emperor, Tang Xiu,” said Tang Xiu.</p><p>Star Tears’ eyes locked on Tang Xiu for a long time before she shook her head and said, “No… you’re definitely not him. I can see it from your appearance and there’s no change in it. But why do you have a familiar aura on you? Why?”</p><p>“I may be able to guess who you’re talking about,” said Tang Xiu calmly. “I also bought a cat female from the Convict Arena some time ago. She also said that I have a familiar aura.”</p><p>Star Tears clenched her fists and she asked in a heavy voice, “Is she from a Dragon Feline Clan?”</p><p>“She is.” Tang Xiu nodded.</p><p>“Where’s she?” asked Star Tears hurriedly. “C-Can I… Can I see her now?”</p><p>Tang Xiu quickly transmitted a message to Kitty. After explaining to her, he summoned her to his place and asked lightly, “Kitty, you should know her, right?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
