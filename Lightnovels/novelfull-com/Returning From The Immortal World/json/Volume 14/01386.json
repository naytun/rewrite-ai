With intense hatred, he gritted his teeth and added, “You’re right, I just hate him so much. I could have become very powerful should he live at least a thousand years more.</p><p>“He’s dead, but it went so easy for him. But for me… what’s left for me to do? No one provides me with huge resources, no presents I can get from being respected, and nobody that can shelter me. The Vermillion Bird Holy Sect is facing impending doom due to the Inner Pill Sect and the Everlasting Palace, while some other forces are now hitting the already shaken sect, persecuting and attacking it, leading to its precarious state, including me…”</p><p>As he growled to this point, he clenched his fists fiercely and shouted, “I was even severely injured by the Inner Pill Sect’s powerhouse and nearly died a few times, so why do I deserve to face such a tragic fate? Why should I be implicated by the evil shit deeds that my so-called Master left behind and become the target of killing by his enemies?</p><p>“I’d respect him if he were still alive because he can bring me benefits and make me stronger. But he just brought me disasters since he died. All the more reason why I hate him. I wish I could resurrect him so I can kill him myself.”</p><p>During his rant, Argent Martial Hale completely laid bare all he wanted to vent and his roar was a bit hysterical, displaying his deep hate for Tang Xiu.</p><p>Tang Xiu kept observing him, but his face turned ghastly pale after the fella finished venting. Never in his wildest dream had he thought that he raised such a thankless wild wolf, an ingrate with a twisted heart.</p><p>“So, do you want to live?” Tang Xiu stared at him and asked slowly.</p><p>“I want to live,” Argent Martial Hale hastily replied. “You can order me to do anything as long as you don’t kill me. That bastard once said that it’s much better to live than to die. I’m afraid of death. I really don’t wanna die.”</p><p>Tang Xiu lifted his foot from his chest and his facial muscles vibrated, recovering his Star Cultivation Great Emperor appearance. It was a similarly stunning handsome face, yet it was now colored with desolateness and chagrin. He then shook his head bitterly and said, “It never crossed my mind that I would be mistaken in receiving a disciple after having gone through 10,000 years of struggles in the Immortal World. The child I’ve raised up so hard turned out to be an ingrate wolf that wants to devour my own flesh and blood.”</p><p>“WHAT?!”</p><p>After crawling up from the ground and seeing Tang Xiu’s appearance, Argent Martial Hale’s countenance sharply changed. Especially when he heard what Tang Xiu said, his whole being was shocked to the core, and he staggered back several steps as though he was seeing a ghost.</p><p>“YOU… IMPOSSIBLE!” Argent Martial Hale screamed.</p><p>With a chilling face, Tang Xiu coldly said, “Do you really think I’m dead? Do you really think Great Emperor Danqing and Zither Demon Jiuyao would become the final winners? Ridiculous! Totally absurd!”</p><p>Argent Martial Hale’s Immortal Soul shivered violently and fear engulfed him. During Tang Xiu’s speech, he frantically dashed toward the distance, but the Soul Extinguishing Array not only made escape futile, but it instead counterattacked his soul. He staggered back to Tang Xiu’s front and heavily fell on the ground with more cracks on his Immortal Soul.</p><p>“IMPOSSIBLE… Absolutely impossible! You… you’re already dead. You failed your Divinity Tribulation and your soul has scattered into oblivion! How come you’re still alive? That’s right, there’s the Bloodbead Seed—something only he and I know in the entire Immortal World. Do you know what this Bloodbead Seed is?”</p><p>“Hmph, with blood as the guide and soul as the medium, moving the Nine States of Destiny to complete the life source of a Bloodbead seed. You’re right that only you know this Bloodbead Seed secret art because… it was an art I precisely created for you,” said Tang Xiu disdainfully.</p><p>Argent Martial Hale was so despairing he almost crawled to Tang Xiu’s feet, screaming, “I admit my mistake, Master. I thought your soul had already scattered. I had to speak ill about you for the sake of my life in front of the enemies. Please forgive me. I’m your favorite little disciple, Master…”</p><p>Looking at his attitude, Tang Xiu secretly shook his head and forced a bitter smile. “This Tang Xiu had once been hailed as Star Cultivation Great Emperor, the strongest Supremacy Stage powerhouse in the Immortal World. Never once has it crossed my mind that I would receive a spineless disciple that would make me lose my face! Sirius’s death was because of your betrayal, wasn’t it? If the information of my intel is correct, you secretly colluded with Venerable Whitecleaver under Great Emperor Danqing to ambush Sirius, causing him to be killed by Whitecleaver. Am I right?”</p><p>“No! That’s not true!” Argent Martial Hale cried out hastily, “I’ve never betrayed Sirius. Master, you must never trust such slander from those villains!”</p><p>“Heh, do you think your Senior Brother Apotheon Mu can be such a villain?” Tang Xiu sneered. “Do you think Myriad Notes, Nine Immortal Fingers, and Enchantress Yu are also like that? Let me tell you something. Those four are now in the Misty Spring Ocean and have become a part of my Great Tang Empire. And I’m the Emperor of the Great Tang Empire, Great Tang Heavenly Emperor!”</p><p>“You are…”</p><p>Argent Martial Hale’s pupils contracted. He finally realized who the person called Great Tang Heavenly Emperor who had shaken the Secret Palace of Drunken Immortal Palace and become famous was. He finally understood who had set him up in the Floating Snow City.</p><p>It turned out to be him!</p><p>“I have dozens of disciples, and only five of them have survived to the present,” said Tang Xiu lightly. “None of them have smeared my reputation, and they will absolutely accompany me back to the apex in the future, to dominate above those Supremes and look down on the myriad of races in the Immortal World. As for you, only death awaits you!”</p><p>Tang Xiu instantly unleashed his divine sword and the violent sword beam straightly cleaved Argent Martial Hale’s Immortal Soul into two as he watched the guy’s Immortal Soul gradually disintegrate.</p><p>“I was wrong. I admit my mistake, Master.”</p><p>It was the last thought Argent Martial Hale transmitted to Tang Xiu.</p><p>Ever since he had returned to the Misty Spring Ocean, Tang Xiu wasn’t able to make up his mind to kill Argent Martial Hale even though this guy had betrayed him and the Vermillion Bird Holy Sect. They were once Master and disciple, and he couldn’t take any ruthless action toward him. However, Argent Martial Hale’s confession exposed the hatred he showed him before, revealed himself as an ingrate wolf that aroused Tang Xiu’s intention to kill.</p><p>Every mistake had a price to pay, but paying it with a scattering soul was still too high a price—way too high.</p><p>“Come out!”</p><p>Tang Xiu put away his complicated emotion, turned to look to the distance, and said indifferently.</p><p>Suddenly, an afterimage appeared out of nowhere in the Soul Extinguishing Array. It was a humpbacked old man with a walking stick, unkempt hair, and dirty ragged clothes. The most striking thing about him was his holed shoes that showed a few toes.</p><p>The old man was so untidy and dirty that even a beggar was probably cleaner than him.</p><p>There was a sarcoma at the center of the old man’s eyebrow and his lifeless-looking murky eyes looked at Tang Xiu before he sat on a large bluestone ten meters away from him. He then shook his head and sighed. “Heavenly Emperor Tianji was right. You’ve really come back to life. I thought I’d never have the chance to repay the favor you showed me in this life forever, and I’d have never been able to cross the tribulation that formed in my heart. But now, this old man sees hope again and sees the direction to reach Godhood.”</p><p>A complex look flashed in Tang Xiu’s eyes. He activated the Message Token and then stared at the old man. “How did you find me, Sky Exterminator Old Beggar?”</p><p>Sky Exterminator old beggar took a worn white porcelain bowl from his sleeve pocket. A fragrance of Jade fine wine immediately fluttered and he took a few mouthfuls of it before he threw the porcelain bowl to Tang Xiu and hummed. “Drink it, I’ll tell you about it.”</p><p>Tang Xiu did not hesitate, took two sips, and immediately felt a surging Immortal Force that exploded in his lower abdomen. The torrential Immortal Force poured into his Dantian, causing a sesame seed-sized planet to suddenly increase by ten million times.</p><p>“Now speak!”</p><p>Tang Xiu threw the white porcelain bowl back to Sky Exterminator old beggar and spoke indifferently.</p><p>“Sigh, this old beggar has been tracking a person called Great Tang Heavenly Emperor and I didn’t expect that person to be you.” Sky Exterminator old beggar sighed. “It’s very strange that I can’t even sense your original aura. Even your Immortal Soul has changed. If it wasn’t that I saw your exchange with that wicked guy, I wouldn’t have been able to see through your identity.”</p><p>“So now, what are you waiting for?” asked Tang Xiu calmly.</p><p>“I’m waiting for Apotheosis Bella,” said Sky Exterminator old beggar with a wry smile.</p><p>“Why?” Tang Xiu asked with a frown.</p><p>“Only when she comes will I have no excuses to kill you,” answered Sky Exterminator old beggar honestly. “I don’t want to keep worrying about a Supreme who will remember me as someone’s killer.”</p><p>Tang Xiu remained silent for a long while and then slowly said, “Go tell Heavenly Emperor Tianji to sever his arm and I’ll write off the issue of him bullying my disciple! Consider sending this message as you’ve paid back the favor and all of our grievances have been written off.”</p><p>Sky Exterminator old beggar was surprised and asked in a deep voice, “Can I take your words seriously?”</p><p>“I mean it,” said Tang Xiu lightly.</p><p>“Are you not afraid I’ll expose your identity?” asked Sky Exterminator old beggar.</p><p>“You won’t dare,” said Tang Xiu lightly.</p><p>Sky Exterminator old beggar bitterly smiled and sighed as he shook his head. “This old man has been wandering unhindered for nearly 20 millenniums, and yet you’re the only one who can make me feel very… helpless. Star Cultivation, don’t die again. This old man has been very lonely because you died. Really lonely.”</p><p>Having said that, he glanced at the direction of the Misty Spring Ocean before he turned into a streak of light that blazed away to the distance to appear ten million miles away.</p><p>“Are you alright, Xiu?”</p><p>Bella rushed to Tang Xiu’s side asked with a gentle expression as she fiercely glared at the direction where Sky Exterminator old beggar just left.</p><p>Tang Xiu shook his head. “It’s alright. I’m fine.”</p><p>“I’ve already heard of some issues between you and Sky Exterminator old beggar,” said Bella. “Did he make things difficult for you?”</p><p>“He didn’t, but I still sent you a message to catch up as fast as you can just in case.” Tang Xiu shook his head and forced a smile. “I trust this man, but trust in this world may prove to be a false one. I don’t want to take any chances because… I’m way too weak now.”</p><p>“I firmly believe you’ll become much stronger soon, Xiu,” said Bella with all seriousness. “However, Sky Exterminator old beggar knows your true identity, which may become an uncertain factor. Do you want me to kill him?”</p><p>“But can you kill him?” asked Tang Xiu back.</p><p>“Well, the chance is less than 1 in 10,000,” replied Bella with a forced smile.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
