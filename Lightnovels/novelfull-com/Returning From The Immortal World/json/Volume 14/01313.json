Looking at Gu Yan’er’s serious expression, he had no other choice but to smile bitterly. He could not refuse bluntly as he could never hurt her.</p><p>Perhaps, Yan’er is right. Let’s just leave everything to time.</p><p>Tang Xiu sighed inwardly and patted her shoulder, saying, “Let’s just stay here to cultivate steadily for the next few days! Eight months are not a long time and will pass by in a flash. Besides, we now have a lot of cultivation resources. We don’t have to worry about the cultivation issues of all members of the Great Tang Empire.”</p><p>Gu Yan’er put away her childish feelings and replied, “Most of the Great Tang Empire’s members are humans from Earth. Although we’ve drilled them with the common sense of the Immortal World, they have yet to really experience the atmosphere and environment here, after all. I think we should let them go out of the Heavenly Abode artifact in batches and let them go to the neighborhood to experience it for the next 8 months.”</p><p>Tang Xiu’s eyes lit up and he smilingly nodded. “That good idea never crossed my mind. That’s really great! You’re right, they’ve followed us to the Immortal World but have only been practicing on that barren planet. It’s been a year and a half, and the last time we let everyone out was to eat here. They still know too little about the situation of the Immortal World.”</p><p>“Yeah!” Gu Yan’er added, “Uncut jades are worthless. Everyone needs to learn what they do not know. In the future, the Great Tang Empire’s people will have to live and work hard in the Immortal World. If they don’t even understand many of the simplest common sense, they will be bound to suffer big losses in the future. In my opinion, let them feel the rushing of the big waves to the shores. They may be loyal to you and the Great Tang Empire, but I’m hoping the entire Great Tang empire members to be the elites of the elites and the strong among the powerful.”</p><p>Tang Xiu slightly nodded and used his spiritual sense to communicate with the Heavenly Abode artifact. Soon after, Tang Ahlang appeared in front of him. Looking at his curious expression, Tang Xiu faintly smiled. “From today on, you’ll follow me to learn and cultivate. In the next 8 months, the Great Tang Empire’s members will come out of the Heavenly Abode artifact in batches to gain experience outside.”</p><p>“That’s awesome!” Tang Ahlang was honestly surprised. “The empire members indeed want to come out of the Heavenly Abode artifact to see the real Immortal World. Master, would you let me arrange them for the occasion?”</p><p>“Well, you tell me, how will you do it?” Tang Xiu chuckled.</p><p>Tang Ahlang ruminated for a few minutes and then said, “You just said that we’re staying here for 8 months, Master. Let them all stay outside for 8 months, which will be contrary to your ideas. I suggest taking batches outside every 2 months. Each batch will consist of 60,000 members who will be led by one commander, whereas a deputy commander will be picked for every 10,000 people… Finally, after being layered on top of the other, every member who’s 30 years or older must take care of six children of the four Legions.”</p><p>“A sound idea. It’s really not easy to think of so much in such a short time, yet you can do it.” Tang Xiu happily nodded. “With your suggestion as a basis, make some necessary adjustments to ensure the safety of our Great Tang Empire’s members. Afterward, prepare to start tomorrow!”</p><p>“There’s another issue I have in mind, Master.” Tang Ahlang quickly interjected. “Although every member has received Immortal Stones and Crystals before, the number was few and everyone wants to use it to absorb and refine it so as to increase their cultivation. Could you send a notice to the Ministry of Finance to issue some more Immortal Stones for us?”</p><p>Tang Xiu thought for a while and said, “Each person will have another 100 Immortal Crystals. As for how to use them, let them figure it out on their own.”</p><p>Tang Ahlang was elated and firmly nodded before he went back to the Heavenly Abode artifact to arrange everything.</p><p>Tang Xiu then called Gu Xiaoxue out of the Heavenly Abode artifact and directly gave her the 1 million Crystal Essences he won from Nine Nether Swordmeister. He wouldn’t be using these Crystal Essences for some time. After all, his cultivation level was only at the Immortal Stage, and using it would be totally wasting resources. However, he had 35,680 Immortal Monsters under him, so Tang Xiu took out 100,000 Crystal Essences for them to temporarily use.</p><p>In an instant, 5 months passed by and there were only 3 months left from the gamble appointment between Nine Nether Swordmeister and his enemy. A total of two batches of 120,000 members of the Great Tang Empire had experienced life in the outside world and made good progress, be it in their knowledge or strength. The third batch was now outside broadening their experience.</p><p>Certainly, the plan devised by Tang Ahlang was much more detailed than what he explained before. Therefore, although members of the Great Tang Empire were practicing outside, they didn’t cause much trouble. Many minor troubles inevitably appeared, but all of them were all easily solved.</p><p>Additionally, Tang Xu personally took command of the Intelligence Department to instruct them before he let them leave with Immortal Crystals. The task was outside their training range, but Tang Xiu ordered Jin Shi and Ye Shishan to reach the Immortal Lyceum territory within 3 years no matter what method they used.</p><p>The Intelligence Department only had 3,000 members in total. They were all powerful characters who were excellent at gathering intelligence. Although these 3,000 people were under Jin Shi and Ye Shishan’s command, Tang Xiu still assigned two late-stage Golden Immortals to them.</p><p>On a side note, there was also the Ministry of Execution under Tang An’s leadership along with Feng Yang and Shui Gui. They were leading 500 assassination experts in the department. They were also going through the experience for these 8 months outside.</p><p>It was Gu Xiaoxue and his aunt Tang Min who made Tang Xiu feel vexed and at a loss whether he had to cry or laugh. Both of them were in charge of the Ministry of Finance. They learned the common sense in the Immortal World during these five months, while at the same time, they applied their business sense, using half a million Immortal Crystals as their capital to earn more than 2 million Immortal Crystals.</p><p>Such capability truly amazed Tang Xiu.</p><p>At the Stargazing Pavilion.</p><p>Tang Xiu sat cross-legged on a cushion, holding a Demon Stone in each palm, quickly absorbing and refining them to strengthen his power bit by bit. Finally, when the last two Demon Stones were thoroughly absorbed and refined, a wry smile appeared on his handsome face.</p><p>The Heavenly Art of Cosmic Genesis was a cultivation art that even the Demon Gods regarded as a treasure. Absorbing Immortal Force had no significant effect as, at most, it could only make the Primal Chaos power in his body be more powerful. However, what he needed to break through most was his physique at the moment. Even without his cultivation base, he could crush ordinary immortals with pure physique strength. He was even confident to trade blows and defeat any of them.</p><p>“Yan’er.” Tang Xiu looked at Gu Yan’er sitting cross-legged on the opposite side.</p><p>Gu Yan’er opened her eyes and asked, “What’s the matter, Master?”</p><p>“I’m going to take Ahlang out for a walk and buy something while convenient,” said Tang Xiu. “You just stay here and practice! But if I don’t come back in a month, wait for the third batch of our personnel to return, and let the fourth batch of members go out for experience.”</p><p>Gu Yan’er thought for a while and said, “No problem, I’ll take charge of the Heavenly Abode artifact. However, Master, you need to take out all those 17 Golden Immortals with you. Else, I’ll be endlessly worrying about your safety.”</p><p>“No need to be that nervous.” Tang Xiu shook his head and smilingly said, “Although the Hessen Castle’s sphere of influence is very vast, we won’t leave too far. Besides, the place where Nine Nether Swordmeister is staying at is not that far from here. I’ll contact him immediately if I have to. I’m sure he can arrive in time.”</p><p>“I’ll be at ease if you bring more people, Master.” Gu Yan’er insisted.</p><p>“Alright, alright.” Tang Xiu said, “Then I’ll take Battle Peng and six other Golden Immortals!”</p><p>“Okay!”</p><p>Gu Yan’er didn’t make things more difficult. She believed that the Golden Immortals purchased from the Convict Area who could survive in such a fierce place where absolute battle-hardened characters were kept.</p><p>Suddenly, Tang Xiu’s complexion slightly changed. He instantly stretched his hand and quickly, Star Devourer Insect flew out of his body. Right after, Tang Xiu heard its voice transmitted. “Immortal Stones, Immortal Crystals, please give me tons of them quickly.”</p><p>Tang Xiu’s expression slightly changed yet again. After giving the Heavenly Abode artifact to Gu Yan’er, he immediately took Star Devourer Insect to the artifact space. When both of them appeared in an empty area, he quickly took out tens of thousands of Immortal Crystals from the interspatial ring and asked in a deep voice, “Are you breaking through, by chance?”</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>Star Devourer Insect only responded shortly and let out a horrible devouring force that continuously swallowed the tens of thousands of Immortal Crystals.</p><p>Immediately after, the Star Devourer Insect’s size began to expand. From a finger-sized state to ten meters in height in just half a minute. Its huge body resembled a hill as it expelled out an enormous aura that made even Tang Xiu’s expression slightly discolored.</p><p>Taking a deep breath, Tang Xiu took out a million Immortal Crystals from his interspatial ring and threw them to Soul Devourer Insect. “I can give you however many you can swallow. Remember to strive to breakthrough directly. The stronger you are, the better!”</p><p>“Understood!”</p><p>Star Devourer Insect was joyful. Tang Xiu’s assurance made the devouring force coming from it to get stronger and stronger as it quickly swallowed the million Immortal Crystals.</p><p>Immediately after, its physique swelled up again. It took 8 days for its body to stop expanding before its aura began to stabilize at a certain high level. When it roared into the sky, Tang Xiu quickly moved and smacked it.</p><p>“Shut the hell up, will you? Do you want to shock everyone in the Heavenly Abode or something?” Tang Xiu chided him furiously.</p><p>Star Devourer Insect quickly converged its aura and its body quickly shrank. In just a moment, it shrank to the size of a fist and floated in front of Tang Xiu, saying, “Ugh… I was a bit excited since my strength has skyrocketed, Master. However, I really feel very strong now. At least stronger than you.”</p><p>Tang Xiu rolled his eyes in response and angrily snapped. “You’re strong enough to fight a Golden Immortal, so you certainly are stronger than me, dummy! Besides, you just devoured too many of my Immortal Crystals, to begin with.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
