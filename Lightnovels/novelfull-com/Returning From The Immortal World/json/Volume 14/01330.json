But the most peculiar thing about them was their rich combat experience. They had experienced hundreds of fights in the Convict Arena cells and had long tempered themselves as combat machines.</p><p>Although Star Tears was only an early-stage Perfected Golden Immortal, she also had rich combat experience. Coupled with the top-grade immortal sword Tang Xiu gave her, the might she unleashed was hard for opponents of the same level to parry. She faced the fight easily even though she took on two Perfected Golden Immortals of the same level.</p><p>The other 20 late-stage Golden Immortals were also experts who fought countless times in the Convict Arena. Each one of them may not be able to fight an early-stage Perfected Golden Immortal alone, but the collaboration of these 20 people was enough to take on and entangle four Perfected Golden Immortals directly.</p><p>“These people are strong!”</p><p>Apotheon Mu himself only faced one Perfected Golden Immortal hitman. At the moment, he continued attacking with the Luminous Nacre Fan and kept forcing his opponent to retreat with much worse injuries. At the same time, he was able to divide his focus and observe the other fights in the surroundings.</p><p>He was also very strong strength and, as Tang Xiu’s direct disciple, his method was earthshaking and heaven-defying that enabled him to suppress other Perfected Golden Immortals at the same level in a fight.</p><p>Yet, he really couldn’t figure out who these people were. The combat prowess these people possessed was simply outrageous. Not even those Masters of medium-sized Immortal Domains could possibly have so many powerhouses under their flag, right?</p><p>For instance, the Immortal Lyceum.</p><p>The Immortal Lyceum was considered as one of the large Immortal Domains in the Immortal World, but its overall power was likely not much stronger than these people.</p><p>After an hour, the fighting situation was getting more and more intense. The eight Perfected Golden Immortal Generals of Zither Demon Jiuyao had all been gravely injured. If they didn’t collaborate to resist the onslaught and besiegement of these people, it was highly likely that some of them would be slain.</p><p>Certainly, Zenith Immortal, Seaway Monarch, and Star Tears were also seriously injured, but their conditions were much better compared to the eight Generals. Four people among the 20 late-stage Golden Immortals had already been seriously injured and withdrawn from battle, whereas the rest had also been scarred, though they still crazily mounted attacks on the enemies.</p><p>Whoosh…</p><p>Next to Tang Xiu, Tang An’s figure suddenly emerged out of nowhere. However, Battle Peng didn’t come to Tang Xiu but instead joined the battle directly.</p><p>“Everything’s been set up, Grand Master.”</p><p>Tang Xiu happily nodded and said, “Activate the array immediately. We must get those 8 Perfected Golden Immortal enemies at once today.”</p><p>“Let my Master do it!”</p><p>Tang An handed a piece of Crystal Essence to Gu Yan’er and whispered, “Master, the crux of the entire immortal array is this Crystal Essence. You only need to activate it to learn the mystery of the array. You can easily control…”</p><p>Gu Yan’er raised her hand to interrupt her and lightly smiled. “I’ll arrange and control the Dragon Imbroglio Array. It’s not difficult to control it.”</p><p>Having said that, she injected her Immortal Force into the Crystal Essence. The instant after, 8 golden runes flowed out like water and quickly spread in all directions. In just a few seconds, the entire space was shrouded in water-like 8 Golden runes while a golden pattern gradually formed below the surface.</p><p>The 8 Zither Demon’s Generals looked terrified at the same time. They chose the location as their battlefield, but they really couldn’t figure out how there could be such an array here. With their visions, they could easily tell that it was the Dragons Imbroglio Array, an array well known for its powerful entrapment in the Immortal World.</p><p>“Quickly join forces to break the array, Brothers!”</p><p>The seriously wounded yellow-robed old man coughed a mouthful of blood as he roared, canceling his attack on the four Perfected Golden Immortals and lunged toward the golden runes pattern on the ground to bombard it. Meanwhile, the other seven Perfected Golden Immortals also gave up most of their defenses and fiercely stormed in the direction of the spot bombarded by the yellow-robed old man.</p><p>Slash, slash, slash…</p><p>The three Perfected Golden Immortals were hit by Seaway Monarch, Zenith Venerable, and Star Tears’ strikes and their immortal weapons hit and shattered the immortal souls of the enemy.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Even though the other five Perfected Golden Immortals weren’t hit, they could escape from getting some ghastly wounds. Two of them even directly lost their combat capabilities.</p><p>However, the Dragons Imbroglio Array directly shattered after getting bombarded by the full blows of 8 Perfected Golden Immortals at the same time.</p><p>“RUN!”</p><p>Wearing a frantic look, the red-robed old man shouted and took a medicinal pill. His aura skyrocketed sharply in just a few seconds. The moment he was under the threat of getting impaled from Star Tear’s piercing strike, he sprayed out some blood and bolted away.</p><p>Slash! Slash! Slash!</p><p>Another 3 Perfected Golden Immortals were killed during their panicked escape. One of them was killed under the bombardment of 10 Golden Immortals.</p><p>A million-kilometer pursuit then commenced, adding more injuries to the last 2 Perfected Golden Immortals who fled away. However, the chase ended up failing to kill them.</p><p>“Master.”</p><p>Seaway Monarch wiped the blood from the corner of his mouth and came to Tang Xiu with a bitter smile on his face, saying, “This subordinate is incompetent and failed to annihilate all the enemies.”</p><p>Tang Xiu narrowed his eyes and lightly said, “Those two fleeing Perfected Golden Immortals must have conjured some secret pills, yes? It should be some strength-enhancement pills that can burst out your power for a short duration. But such pills will inflict great harm to themselves. Zither Demon Jiuyao has two kinds of pills. One of which is Bloodlust Pill and the other one is the Dawnravine Auric Venom Fluid. Those two just took a pill, so I’m sure they took the Bloodlust Pill one.”</p><p>Seaway Monarch and Zenith Venerable looked shocked. They keenly realized that their present Master seemed to know Zither Demon Jiuyao very well.</p><p>A look of surprise also glinted in Star Tears’ eyes and she cast a suspicious look at Tang Xiu before turning to Apotheon Mu and asking with a trace of concern, “How is your injury?”</p><p>Apotheon Mu shook his head, but his eyes never moved away from Tang Xiu.</p><p>Tang Xiu took out some healing elixirs from his interspatial ring and handed them to everyone, saying, “Take your time to recuperate. We need to leave this place soon.”</p><p>Having said that, he shifted to Apotheon Mu and lightly said, “Don’t forget your promise. The Misty Spring Ocean will be my territory from now on. You can also choose to submit to me and take those under you to be the subjects of the Great Tang Empire together.”</p><p>The Great Tang Empire?</p><p>Apotheon Mu had never heard of it. He quietly looked at Tang Xiu and sensed some familiarity from him. Despite so, he still shook his head and said, “I apologize. I can hand over the Misty Spring Ocean to you, but I’ll never submit to anyone, not even you. This life-saving grace will forever be carved in this Mu’s heart. However, I may have no opportunity to repay you in the future.”</p><p>Tang Xiu frowned and said, “Your injury is not fatal and you can recover in half a year at the most after taking the healing elixir. Meaning you still have your chances to repay me.”</p><p>Apotheon Mu remained reticent for more than 10 seconds before he finally replied and shook his head with a bitter expression, “Mister, you’re also aware that I’m the disciple of Star Cultivation Great Emperor, so you should know the deep feud between me and Great Emperor Danqing and Zither Demon Jiuyao. To tell you the truth, four Martial Brothers of mine are being imprisoned by Great Emperor Danqing in the Heavenly Mountain suffering inhuman torture. That’s why I have to rescue them even though I’m well aware of the fact that the chance of me surviving this ordeal is very minuscule.”</p><p>Tang Xiu’s pupils contracted and killing intent in his heart streaked to the heavens. Then, he asked in a heavy voice, “You said that your Martial Brothers are being imprisoned by Great Emperor Danqing in the Heavenly Mountain?”</p><p>“That’s right!” Apotheon Mu nodded.</p><p>“Who are those four?” Tang Xiu asked, “I’ve heard about the disciples of Star Cultivation Great Emperor. Each one of them is an outstanding person in the Immortal World and has a strength that cannot be underestimated.”</p><p>“They are Senior Brother Myriad Notes, Junior Brother Soaring Plum, Junior Brother Nine Immortal Fingers, and Junior Sister Enchantress Yu.”</p><p>“As far as I know, the disciples of Star Cultivating Great Emperor are not just your lot, right? Why must you go alone to the rescue when you have so many other martial brothers and sisters? What about the others? Don’t you know your chance is better in saving them by uniting with the rest?”</p><p>Apotheon Mu clenched his fists and killing intent burst from his eyes. “Most have died in battles or defected to the enemy.”</p><p>Tang Xiu originally intended to tell Apotheon Mu his identity to learn the thorough situation of the Immortal World through him. But due to this rescue, he temporarily changed his mind. But after hearing such a statement from him, Tang Xiu instantly changed his mind and abandoned the plan.</p><p>From this fight, he knew that Apotheon Mu’s loyalty toward him was unquestionable and that he would never betray him.</p><p>Waving his hand, Tang Xiu said in a deep voice, “Everyone, enter the Heavenly Abode artifact to recuperate. You’re not allowed to come out without my summons!”</p><p>“Understood!”</p><p>Everyone nodded and entered the Heavenly Abode one after another, including Gu Yan’er and Battle Peng.</p><p>Tang Xiu then shifted to Apotheon Mu and calmly said, “Take me to the Misty Spring Ocean! We need to have a good talk. I’m sure you’ll agree to swear your loyalty to me afterward.”</p><p>Apotheon Mu couldn’t help laughing. He felt that Tang Xiu had too much confidence while he himself had been prepared to risk everything and sacrifice himself and would never choose to pledge his allegiance to anyone. As long as he could find the Holy Dragon Fruit and rescue his martial brothers and sisters, he was willing to sacrifice himself.</p><p>Misty Spring Ocean.</p><p>Repose Cliff.</p><p>This was the Immortal Abode of Apotheon Mu where he lived in seclusion and cultivated for many years. As the wide gate opened, he took Tang Xiu into the Immortal Mansion on the cliff. At his command, four maids then brought fine wine and delicious dishes, along with immortal fruits as desserts.</p><p>“I haven’t asked your excellency’s name, have I?”</p><p>Apotheon Mu filled two cups of fine wine and asked Tang Xiu after giving him a cup.</p><p>Tang Xiu put the cup down and walked slowly to a portrait hanging on the wall. While looking at the familiar face on it, his appearance began to change and soon became exactly the same as the person in the painting on the wall.</p><p>“Little Mu, do you still remember the Golden Lotus Secret Classics?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
