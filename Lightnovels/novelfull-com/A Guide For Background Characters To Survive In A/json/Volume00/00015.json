As the first to introduce themselves, they didn’t clearly explain their ability, clearly hiding something, which set a precedent for the other students.</p><p>Mu Tieren was cheerful and enjoyed helping classmates, resembling a big brother with a strong sense of justice. Su Bei assumed he would have many interactions with the main group, naturally leading to more screen time.</p><p>The last person, Wu Jin, seemed unremarkable at first, but his personality was distinct—a gloomy introvert, starkly contrasting with the other, more ordinary students.</p><p>With most of the classmates seated, Su Bei took a deep breath. He knew his turn was approaching if everything went as expected.</p><p>Despite his confidence, Su Bei couldn’t help feeling anxious until his scene was revealed. If the author didn’t include his scene, all his previous efforts would have been in vain. He wouldn’t know when the next manga update would be, and without any change in abilities, it would be hard to maintain his disguise.</p><p>Fortunately, the author didn’t disappoint him. The specially designed scene was indeed shown.</p><p>This scene was from Jiang Tianming's perspective. Feeling someone’s gaze, he looked toward the door and saw a handsome boy standing there.</p><p>Whether it was due to the filters or the shadows outside, the boy's golden hair and purple eyes, which should have been bright, appeared somewhat dark in this frame, like a figure lurking in the shadows. This didn’t detract from his attractiveness; instead, it added a sense of mystery.</p><p>However, when the boy walked into the classroom, the dark feeling disappeared, replaced by an amazement similar to that caused by Feng Lan earlier. The sunlight on his golden hair seemed to light up the entire classroom.</p><p>Next was a bird's-eye view, showing Su Bei walking straight toward Jiang Tianming, stopping in front of him, followed by a close-up of his face.</p><p>The golden hair shone brilliantly in the sunlight, his handsome face full of interest, a bold and unrestrained smile, and deep purple eyes twinkling like stars.</p><p>“Saluting you on behalf of fate, the unluckiest of the unlucky in this generation~”</p><p>At the same time, the real-time comments exploded.</p><p>[Wife! My destined wife!]</p><p>[Damn, you draw men so well.]</p><p>[Saluting you on behalf of fate, this year's unluckiest unlucky person!]</p><p>[So edgy, I love it!]</p><p>As this scene concluded and seeing the comments, Su Bei finally breathed a sigh of relief, a satisfied smile appearing on his face.</p><p>He knew he was set now. Just based on his looks in the manga alone, the discussion about this scene would be substantial.</p><p>The manga artist was indeed skilled. Despite being a 2D manga, it felt more vivid than reality. Since he had acted on a whim, his acting might not have been that good, but the manga portrayed it perfectly, showing exactly what he intended to convey.</p><p>Anyone who read it would firmly believe he was a mysterious, playful character.</p><p>Continuing to read, the next part showed Jiang Tianming's internal monologue, where he questioned Su Bei's intentions and identity.</p><p>When Jiang Tianming guessed that Su Bei might know his parents, Su Bei almost choked on his saliva.</p><p>What kind of thought process is that?</p><p>After their exchange, Meng Huai made his entrance. His physique was vividly depicted with a few strokes—muscular, broad shoulders, narrow waist, exuding a powerful presence like a tiger descending the mountain to patrol its territory.</p><p>The manga's pace was quick. The self-introductions of the whole class were briefly covered in a six-panel grid, and the next scene showed Meng Huai scolding everyone as useless and making them run ten laps.</p><p>As the students started leaving the classroom one by one, the manga gave a big close-up of the teaching building and the playground.</p><p>The Ability Academy's teaching building looked like a European castle, grand and mysterious. Unfortunately, first-year students weren't allowed upstairs, so no one knew what it looked like, but the first floor was similar to an ordinary school.</p><p>The playground, however, was overly vast. Just hearing that one lap was 1,600 meters, one could imagine how huge it was. From a bird's-eye view, people looked like ants on it.n/o/vel/b//in dot c//om</p><p>Su Bei didn’t expect that the running segment on the playground would reveal such crucial information: Jiang Tianming's ability had a problem!</p><p>Due to social anxiety, Lan Subing, who could hardly use her ability, softly used Word Spirit on herself before they started running: \"Tianming and I will easily finish ten laps.\"</p><p>However, her ability, which hadn’t been well-trained, couldn't support controlling two people. Unable to maintain it, and at Jiang Tianming's persuasion, Lan Subing only enhanced herself. Jiang Tianming had to run purely on his own effort.</p><p>His stamina wasn’t great, and he felt exhausted after the fourth lap.</p><p>At this moment, a phantom appeared behind him—it was the female character who helped him defeat the final boss in the first manga. This character's appearance seemed to give Jiang Tianming strength, allowing him to run another two laps.</p><p>After these two laps, Jiang Tianming was completely drained, stumbling forward but stubbornly refusing to fall behind. The character started to half-push and half-carry Jiang Tianming, becoming more and more transparent.</p><p>Two more laps, and the phantom completely disappeared.</p><p>Just as Su Bei was wondering how Jiang Tianming managed the final two laps, he widened his eyes, seeing yet another phantom appear behind Jiang Tianming.</p><p>And this phantom was none other than the final boss from the first manga!</p><p>This was undoubtedly shocking news.</p><p>\"Death Summoning, Death Summoning... So that’s what it means!\" Su Bei's eyes grew increasingly clear as he murmured about Jiang Tianming's ability.</p><p>He now fully understood the true function of Death Summoning. It allowed the protagonist to collect the souls of those he killed and summon them for his use.</p><p>No wonder Jiang Tianming was the protagonist—this ability was indeed extraordinary, at least worthy of being in class A. The only question was whether the summoned individuals could still use their original abilities. If they could, it would be incredibly powerful.</p><p>Suddenly, Su Bei thought of something. Without continuing the manga, he quickly exited and opened the first manga, flipping to the end.</p><p>At the end of the first season, the protagonist sits on a hospital bed, looking at his palm, murmuring: \"The third one.\"</p><p>At that time, Su Bei didn’t understand what \"the third one\" meant. But now, it seemed to imply that Jiang Tianming could already perform Death Summoning three times.</p><p>The first female figure, Su Bei guessed, was Jiang Tianming's mother or another relative. The second figure, of course, was the final boss of the first season.</p><p>So who was the third?</p><p>Frowning, Su Bei reopened the second manga and patiently continued reading.</p><p>After the protagonist finished running, the scene cut to the classroom. Meng Huai was standing by the window with an unfamiliar man, watching them run. He then gave a detailed commentary on each character who had appeared so far.</p><p>Through this scene, Su Bei learned Meng Huai's evaluation of him.</p><p>It was great—exactly the outcome he wanted. If the readers could deduce from this storyline, then it wouldn’t be long before he could change his ability.</p><p>The feedback in the comment section was also quite positive.</p><p>[I knew the handsome homeroom teacher wasn't simple!]</p><p>[What’s Feng Lan's true identity?]</p><p>[LOL, does Bing Bing know she’s been outdone?]</p><p>[Meng Huai: Looks like Jiang Tianming is messing with me.]</p><p>[Is the slacker Su Bei? Totally suits his playful vibe.]</p><p>[Both parents gone? Poor guy. Oh, he's a joker? Never mind.]</p><p>[A quick review of the BeiFeng CP.]</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
