Aside from our Jiang Jiang, Bing Bing, and Ming Bai, the three cuties, I'm currently most interested in Su Bei and Feng Lan.</p><p>From what the homeroom teacher Meng said, it seems that Feng Lan is the next head of the Feng family, known for their prophecy abilities, and he himself mentioned that his ability is [Prophecy].</p><p>Su Bei claimed his ability is [Gears], but from his various behaviors, his true ability probably also has a lot to do with prophecy, with the gears he summons serving as a medium for prophecy.</p><p>However, I find it a bit strange that two people in the same class have prophecy abilities. If they were twins or had some blood relation, it would make more sense, but judging by their appearances, they probably have no kinship. So why would the author design two characters with such similar abilities?

That character hidden in the corner is definitely important!\"</p><p>\"Fine, fine, you were right,\" her friend replied, surprised that Lin Xue had guessed correctly.</p><p>Lin Xue raised her voice, \"I’m declaring now, this is my new favorite. Gold and purple are the best combination! I’ve already set aside money to buy the seeds, so old thief, I suggest you don’t miss this chance.\"</p><p>Only then did she suddenly realize she was still in a restaurant. Faced with the astonished looks from the people around her, her face turned bright red. She quickly finished her last bite and stood up, ready to leave this place where she had just socially embarrassed herself.</p><p>However, before she could leave the restaurant, a guy walked up quickly and asked in a low voice, \"Were you just talking about Su Bei?\"</p><p>Hearing this, Lin Xue turned sharply. Their eyes met, and sparks flew.</p><p>A kindred spirit!</p><p>-- In the manga world --</p><p>After reading the post, Su Bei couldn’t help but smile.

Wouldn’t it be more interesting to walk in the gray area in between?</p><p>Perhaps he could even use the forum to truly create a third-party organization that blends black and white.</p><p>With class about to start, Su Bei stopped browsing the forum. For now, the content was under control, with discussions proceeding just as he expected, so there was no need for deliberate guidance.</p><p>Using the last bit of time, Su Bei quickly created a post with content he had long prepared. He wanted to start laying the groundwork for his presence on the forum.</p><p><b>[Prophet’s Post] Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon in Class F!!!</b></p><p><b>Prophet no. 0:</b> \"As it stands, Jiang Jiang and Bing Bing will likely stay in Class F for a while. So according to the protagonist law (where important characters always surround the protagonist), Class F should have many key characters.</p><p>Based on my research, these characters from Class F should have plenty of storylines.</p><p><b>[Prediction]</b> Feng Lan with his ability, Su Bei reprsenting destiny, Zhao Xiaoyu (who was the first to introduce herself), the two boys who were first and last in the running circle, and homeroom teacher Meng Huai.</p><p>As the prophet, the goal is 100% accuracy. I welcome everyone to verify this post later!\"</p><p>As someone genuinely living in Class F, even though he couldn’t see the future plot, Su Bei had a significant advantage in predicting the story because he could observe many details that the manga hadn’t drawn.</p><p>The people he mentioned in his post likely hadn’t been noticed by other readers. Their identities were indeed somewhat special, so even if he pointed them out, no one would suspect him of cheating.</p><p>And most importantly, even if any of the people he mentioned ended up not having special storylines, it wouldn’t matter. Su Bei could simply bring them into the manga’s frame and forcibly add them to the plot, ensuring his \"prophecy\" wouldn’t fail.</p><p>For his next post, he planned to predict the identity of the murderer or something similar. With two successful posts as a foundation, he could then start spreading misinformation to his heart’s content.</p><p>After posting, Su Bei didn’t wait to see the replies and directly turned off his phone and left the bathroom. He was laying the groundwork, so others’ responses were not important to him at this stage.</p><p>In fact, if he had more than one account, Su Bei would have used a side account to post some negative comments about himself in the thread.</p><p>Shortly after returning to class, Meng Huai, dressed all in black, walked in. \"I’m your ability practice class teacher. No need for introductions, right?\"</p><p>As he spoke, he walked up to the podium and scanned the room: \"First, I have a few announcements. The first is about the appointment of the class monitor. Mu Tieren, you’ll be the class monitor for Class F. Any objections?\"</p><p>Mu Tieren was the boy who led the run yesterday and even helped take some struggling students to the school clinic afterward. Everyone seemed fine with him becoming the class monitor. Of course, this level of agreement was partly because this was Class F; if it were Class A, there would likely be competition for the position.</p><p>\"The next thing I want to mention is—\" Meng Huai sneered as he read off a long list of names, \"Zhao He, Li Weide... Chang Sisi, you’ve been advised by the school to withdraw. You can contact a regular high school.\"</p><p>The room instantly erupted, especially among the students whose names were called, all of whom looked shocked.</p><p>Granted, their abilities were indeed useless, but by coming here, they had hoped to obtain an \"Ability Use License.\" Without that license, they wouldn’t be allowed to use their abilities in public places in the future. How could they accept this?</p><p>But before they could voice their protests, Meng Huai, as if reading their minds, said, \"Are you wondering why you’ve been advised to leave? None of you completed the ten laps yesterday, right?\"</p><p>The truth came out—this was why they were being asked to withdraw!</p><p>With that, the rest of the class had no objections, but the students being expelled clearly weren’t ready to give in. Zhao He, his face flushed, said, \"Teacher, I know we were at fault for not completing the laps yesterday, but isn’t expulsion too severe a punishment?\"</p><p>With him speaking up, the others seemed to find their courage. Chang Sisi, on the verge of tears, said, \"Teacher, I’m sorry. I’ll never slack off again. I’ll go run ten laps right now... no, twenty laps. Please don’t expel me!\"</p><p>\"Yes, yes, us too!\" the others chimed in.</p><p>Seeing them beg so earnestly moved some of the other students, who considered speaking up on their behalf.</p><p>However, Meng Huai remained unmoved and even used this as an opportunity to make an example of them: \"Don’t act like you’re the victims here. The school advising you to leave is for your own good.\"</p><p>\"Being an ability user is a dangerous profession. All ability users attract fatal attention from the Nightmares. Even F-class ability users, if they use their abilities too often, will attract Nightmares—after all, even a small mosquito is still meat. The school gathers you here to teach you so that we can reduce the casualties among ability users.\"</p><p>This was common knowledge. Otherwise, the mere \"Ability Use License\" wouldn’t have been enough to convince so many students, who had already given up on their abilities, to spend their time at this school instead of a regular one.</p><p>\"Unlike the students in other classes, you don’t have much self-protection capability and can almost only rely on yourselves. For the sake of your own safety, following your teacher’s instructions and training diligently should be an absolute rule for each of you. But clearly, those of you who slacked off on the first day don’t have this awareness.\"</p><p>These words made the few students blush with embarrassment. They hadn’t thought about it that much; they just found the ten laps too much and couldn’t resist slacking off.</p><p>\"Rather than letting you half-heartedly train, and then get your ‘Ability Use License,’ only to attract Nightmares and harm others and yourselves in the process, it’s better to advise you to withdraw now and avoid that possibility.\"</p><p>Having said that, Meng Huai didn’t want to waste any more time: \"Alright, now please leave the classroom. If you have any issues, you can talk to the principal. If the principal agrees to let you come back, then you can return.\"</p><p>Though he said that, Meng Huai knew the principal would never agree since the suggestion to \"advise a few F-class students to withdraw\" came from the principal himself.</p><p>F-class students were practically incapable of eliminating Nightmares; keeping them at the school was a waste of resources and disrupted their regular studies. Advising them to withdraw was beneficial for everyone.</p><p>Although those students were reluctant, the intimidating presence of Meng Huai’s strong physique made them too scared to stay in the classroom any longer, so they left one by one.</p><p>After they left, Meng Huai acted as if nothing had happened. Without issuing any warnings to the remaining students, he started the lesson: \"Now, I want you to use your abilities. Focus on what you lose when you use them.\"</p><p>It was common knowledge that using abilities consumed mental energy, so Meng Huai wanted everyone to experience the feeling of losing that energy.</p><p>Su Bei, having used his ability quite a bit yesterday, was already familiar with the sensation of losing mental energy. He casually summoned an ordinary gear, then turned to look at Feng Lan.</p><p>After all, Feng Lan had a genuine [Prophecy] ability, and Su Bei was curious to see what it looked like in action.</p><p>Because he turned around, Su Bei didn’t notice that behind him, Jiang Tianming and Lan Su Bing, who had been watching him closely since experiencing his ability, were puzzled by the plain pattern on the gear on his desk.</p><p>The difference was significant between this ordinary hardware piece and the collectible artwork they had seen yesterday.</p><p>How could there be such a big difference?</p><p>Feng Lan didn’t mind using his ability in front of others, but its manifestation wasn’t as grand as Su Bei had imagined.</p><p>The white-haired boy lowered his head, closed his eyes, clasped his hands together, and his body faintly emitted a white glow. After a moment, he opened his eyes, and a flash of golden light disappeared as quickly as it appeared. His originally pale skin became even paler, his lips lost some color, and he looked somewhat fatigued.</p><p>\"I saw a quarrel during this class.\"</p><p>This was clearly a prophecy. Su Bei was momentarily stunned but then realized what he meant: \"Do you mean someone will argue in this class? Between a student and the teacher, or between students?\"</p><p>However, Feng Lan shook his head. He had only recently awakened his ability and wasn’t very good at controlling it: \"This time, I only predicted the event and the time.\"</p><p>Hearing this, Su Bei wasn’t disappointed. Instead, he made a show of understanding, deliberately saying, \"No worries, everyone goes through this.\"</p><p>This response made Feng Lan look up suddenly and ask the question Su Bei had been hoping for: \"Everyone? Do you know other [Prophecy] ability users?\"</p><p>Note:</p><p>This chapter is really tough to translate, my head feels like it's going to explode TT</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
