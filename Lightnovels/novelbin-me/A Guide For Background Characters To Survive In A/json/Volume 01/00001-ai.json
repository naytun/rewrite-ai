  "body": "<p>When Su Bei stepped into the bathroom, a haze clouded his thoughts, muffling the sounds that drifted from the innermost stall. Something felt amiss, a nagging sensation that tugged at his awareness.</p>\n<p>Suddenly, clarity struck him like a bolt of lightning—he was running out of time for the opening ceremony.</p>\n<p>From past experiences, he knew the bathroom would be bustling at this hour. Once the speech commenced, there would be a long stretch of time when no one could enter, which was precisely why he had come now.</p>\n<p>Yet, the bathroom was eerily empty, save for the innermost stall, where he sensed the presence of someone. All other stalls stood vacant.</p>\n<p>As he turned to leave, a yellow sign caught his eye at the entrance, likely warning against entry. How had he missed that?</p>\n<p>Before he could dwell on it, a faint movement behind him triggered his instincts, honed by his military upbringing.</p>\n<p>Someone was approaching!</p>\n<p>Instinctively, he stilled his breathing and refrained from turning around. Instead, he feigned indifference, moving forward as if to inspect the yellow sign.</p>\n<p>As the figure drew nearer, Su Bei's mind raced, calculating the movements of the person behind him based on the subtle shifts in air.</p>\n<p>It was someone of similar height, emerging from the innermost stall, wielding a sharp weapon. He could hear the whisper of metal slicing through the air.</p>\n<p>With a reflexive motion, he seized the wrist of the assailant just as the dagger aimed for his neck. Without hesitation, he slid his right foot back, using his wrist and waist to throw the attacker over his shoulder.</p>\n<p>\"Bang!\"</p>\n<p>The impact echoed as the figure hit the ground, just as Su Bei had predicted. The assailant, clad in black and wearing a silver mask that revealed only purplish-red eyes, was indeed of similar stature.</p>\n<p>The dagger clattered to the floor, rendered useless by the unexpected turn of events.</p>\n<p>Footsteps echoed from outside; the school staff had clearly heard the commotion and were rushing to investigate.</p>\n<p>Before Su Bei could unmask his attacker, the man transformed into a wisp of black smoke, dissipating into the air.</p>\n<p>\"A superpower.\"</p>\n<p>Su Bei's expression darkened; he realized he might never find the person. Just as he began to rise, a sudden pain surged through his head, blurring his vision until he collapsed to the ground.</p>\n<p>When he regained consciousness, he found himself in a stark white space.</p>\n<p>Everywhere he looked was pure white, devoid of any features or boundaries. It felt as if he had stepped into a void.</p>\n<p>Where was he?</p>\n<p>He had clearly fainted in the bathroom, and he had heard the footsteps of others nearby. Normally, staff would take a student found unconscious in the bathroom to the infirmary or a classroom.</p>\n<p>But this place was neither.</p>\n<p>After a moment's hesitation, Su Bei decided to rise. With no one around, remaining on the ground was not a viable option.</p>\n<p>He stood and surveyed the white expanse. The only object in sight was a table and a chair, with two books stacked atop it.</p>\n<p>Approaching the table, he pulled out the chair and sat down, examining the books.</p>\n<p>To his surprise, the first book was a comic. Its cover featured vibrant characters, with a resolute black-haired boy at the center, flanked by a boy and a girl. The girl, with long water-blue hair and calm brown-yellow eyes, had her mouth taped shut, suggesting she could not speak.</p>\n<p>The boy beside her wore a smile, with brown hair and orange eyes, resembling a typical protagonist from a shonen manga.</p>\n<p>Behind them, various characters, young and old, filled the colorful cover.</p>\n<p>The title loomed large at the top: \"The King of Superpower.\"</p>\n<p>The only term that resonated with him was \"superpower.\" These were rare abilities that only a select few could awaken, each varying in strength.</p>\n<p>Once discovered, superpowered individuals were sent to the \"Infinite Abilities Academy.\" Only after graduation could they be recognized as superpowered individuals capable of using their abilities in society.</p>\n<p>Coincidentally, Su Bei had just awakened his superpower, and today marked the first day for first-year students at the \"Infinite Abilities Academy.\" He was a freshman in Class F.</p>\n<p>Redirecting his focus to the second book, he noticed it was thin, only four or five pages long, with a plain white cover devoid of illustrations.</p>\n<p>Flipping it open, he found it was also a black-and-white comic.</p>\n<p>Frowning, he set the second book aside and returned to the first.</p>\n<p>Although he was uncertain about the significance of these books, it was clear someone wanted him to read them.</p>\n<p>In his current predicament, meeting their expectations seemed the only way forward.</p>\n<p>The first comic unfolded the story of Jiang Tianming, the black-haired protagonist, alongside Wu Mingbai and Lan Subing. Both boys were orphans, while the girl was the eldest daughter of the \"Lan Group.\" The narrative followed their quest to uncover the truth behind their orphanage headmistress's \"suicide\" and thwart an evil group's human modification experiments.</p>\n<p>As with all shonen manga, the trio formed deep bonds through humorous and heartfelt interactions, each awakening their own superpowers.</p>\n<p>Wu Mingbai possessed the 【Earth Element】 power, a secret he kept despite his cheerful demeanor. Readers would soon realize he was a classic innocent character with a cunning side.</p>\n<p>Lan Subing awakened the 【Word Spirit】 power, a cruel twist for someone who struggled to communicate.</p>\n<p>Jiang Tianming's ability, 【Death Summon】, allowed him to summon a woman resembling him in times of need, ultimately defeating the final boss.</p>\n<p>In the comic's closing scene, Jiang Tianming awoke in a hospital bed, gazing at his palm with a complex expression: \"The third one.\"</p>\n<p>Despite the foreshadowing, Su Bei found enjoyment in the story. The characters were refreshingly unique, and the plot was filled with unexpected twists.</p>\n<p>Their superpowers were intriguing, especially to Su Bei, who had awakened what he considered a lackluster ability and was assigned to Class F at the academy.</p>\n<p>At sixteen, his superpower, 【Gears】, allowed him to create patterned, size-controllable gears based on his mental strength—a typical Class F ability.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, he had no intention of relying on his superpower for a living. With his mother having died in childbirth and his father passing away in the line of duty two years prior, he had inherited enough to live comfortably.</p>\n<p>Su Bei planned to graduate from Class F, open a hardware store, and enjoy an early retirement—a fitting use for his superpower.</p>\n<p>However, the situation was perplexing; he hadn't even attended the opening ceremony yet found himself in this space reading comics. Even if the comic was enjoyable, why was he compelled to read it?</p>\n<p>As he pondered the final scene, a realization struck him. The three characters had awakened their superpowers during this time, and they would soon receive their acceptance letters from the \"Infinite Abilities Academy.\"</p>\n<p>Curiosity piqued, he raised an eyebrow and decisively opened the second comic.</p>\n<p>As anticipated, it began with the trio receiving their acceptance letters from the academy.</p>\n<p>Days later, special examiners would assess their superpower levels for class placement, mirroring Su Bei's own experience.</p>\n<p>Class placements at the academy were not permanent; students could advance at any time. As their mental strength and combat experience grew, even seemingly useless superpowers could evolve, allowing them to enter higher classes.</p>\n<p>Lan Subing, initially placed in Class A, ended up in Class F due to her inability to speak, despite her 【Word Spirit】 power. Once she found her voice, she could easily move up.</p>\n<p>Wu Mingbai was assigned to Class D, limited by the extent of his superpower.</p>\n<p>Jiang Tianming, despite his potential for Class C, landed in Class F due to exhaustion from his previous battle, appearing no different from an ordinary student during the assessment.</p>\n<p>They all attended the same academy and were in Class F. Su Bei's expression grew even more perplexed as he murmured, \"Am I also in this comic?\"</p>\n<p>Turning the page, the story took a dark turn with a murder in the school bathroom right after the term began. A male student lay in a pool of blood, surrounded by scattered small gears.</p>\n<p>Su Bei's expression drained as he recognized the scene.</p>\n<p>If he wasn't mistaken, the boy on the ground was likely himself.</p>",
