He suppressed his breathing and quietly asked, “Should we eliminate them?”</p><p>Eliminate…</p><p>Hearing this word, Su Bei’s eyelid twitched as an earlier thought flashed through his mind.</p><p>It’s always good to think through the worst possible outcome when faced with danger. Along the way, he had been pondering this issue. If this event really was part of a conspiracy targeting all the first-year students, what should they do?</p><p>Logically, they should be safe in this alternate space. After all, breaking the fragile glass on the watch face would immediately teleport them out. Even if someone ambushed them, as long as they were in mortal danger, they could instantly escape the space.</p><p>So the only scenario where danger might arise was if the teleportation system malfunctioned. If they couldn’t leave the alternate space, they would be like lambs to the slaughter when facing advanced ability users.</p><p>But could the mastermind really go that far? Tampering with the life-saving measures provided by the academy? If that were the case, the academy must be riddled with security holes.</p><p>This was the worst-case scenario, and Su Bei could only hope it wasn’t true.</p><p>Sighing, he nodded. “Let’s give it a try. Besides, we haven’t seen what it looks like to eliminate someone yet.”</p><p>After a moment’s thought, he added, “Let’s use the method of breaking the glass on their watch.”</p><p>He worried that if the teleportation system really was malfunctioning, killing someone wouldn’t just send them out of alternate space—it would result in their actual death.</p><p>To make them break the glass on their own, they would either have to feel a significant threat and voluntarily leave or be subdued so Su Bei could break the glass for them.</p><p>The first option was unlikely; the second seemed more practical.</p><p>After thinking it over, Su Bei asked, “How many air blocks can you create now?”</p><p>“Ten!” Mo Xiaotian answered excitedly, pleased that Su Bei had asked about something he excelled at. He was quite proud of the first ability he had developed.</p><p>Ten would be enough. Su Bei nodded. “I’ll sneak attack from behind and drive the others away. You just need to trap one person.”</p><p>The two had cooperated several times before and worked well together. Su Bei launched a few gear attacks, easily scaring most of the group into fleeing. At only 15 or 16 years old, the students weren’t particularly brave, especially in a dark, ominous forest. They quickly scattered in panic, abandoning their group.</p><p>Meanwhile, Mo Xiaotian had already targeted a boy and surrounded him with several air blocks, preventing his escape.</p><p>The boy was clearly terrified and tried to call for help, but his teammates were too busy running for their own lives to bother with him.</p><p>Once the others were gone, Su Bei emerged and easily subdued the boy.</p><p>“It’s… it’s a person!” The boy, restrained but oddly relieved, smiled nervously. He would much rather be eliminated by classmates than haunted by ghosts.</p><p>“Yes, I’m human.” Su Bei stepped into the moonlight, letting the boy see his shadow. “Will you leave on your own, or should I help you?”</p><p>Hearing this confirmation, the boy breathed a long sigh of relief. He hesitated for a moment before asking cautiously, “Brother, could you let me go?”</p><p>“What do you think?” Su Bei asked with a faint smile.</p><p>Yeah, that wasn’t happening. The boy sighed in resignation. “Fine, I’ll leave on my own.”</p><p>He knew he wouldn’t contribute much in a team battle anyway, and becoming someone’s captive was just the logical outcome. As the teachers had said earlier, the sooner you’re out, the sooner your vacation begins. To him, that didn’t sound too bad.</p><p>Before the boy left, Su Bei gave him a final instruction: “Once you’re out, go find Mr. Meng Huai from Class F and tell him that Feng Lan disappeared right after entering this space. He might be in danger.”</p><p>“Got it. You’re eliminating me and still making me run errands for you? What an inspiring display of friendship.”</p><p>Grumbling, the boy decisively broke the glass on his watch. The next moment, he disappeared into thin air.</p><p>“Wow, that’s amazing!” Mo Xiaotian exclaimed, eyes wide with wonder. “You can just leave like that? Breaking the glass was so easy, too! I was worried I wouldn’t be able to break it if I needed to.”</p><p>Su Bei’s expression softened with a hint of relief as he nodded. “Yeah, it’s really convenient.”</p><p>Since breaking the glass still worked to exit the alternate space, there wasn’t much to worry about. Maybe he had overthought things, and the enemy’s conspiracy wasn’t related to this.</p><p>Wait… something’s wrong.</p><p>Su Bei’s expression froze. Suddenly, he remembered—Feng Lan had also disappeared as soon as they entered. Who said disappearing meant returning to the academy?</p><p>And as he had considered earlier, this was only the first day of the group competition. Even if the enemy planned to make a move, wasn’t it too soon? Maybe today’s teleportation system was working fine, but who’s to say it wouldn’t malfunction later?</p><p>we can't let our guard down.</p><p>\"Alright, it’s better to regroup with Jiang Tianming for a long-term solution.\" Su Bei sighed, glanced at his watch, and said, “Let’s go. We need to find Jiang Tianming and the others quickly. It’s already so dark, and we still don’t have a place to sleep.”</p><p>After realizing their pursuers had disappeared, Jiang Tianming and Mu Tieren stopped running. They were already exhausted after running for so long, and the night wasn’t safe. If their pursuers continued chasing them, even if they felt they might lose, they would have no choice but to fight back.</p><p>Bad luck had struck Jiang Tianming earlier—he ran into an opponent he had deeply offended during the individual matches. Worse yet, that opponent had teamed up with another rival for some reason, creating a group of over ten people. There was no way Jiang and Mu could win against that.</p><p>Escaping should have been easier in the dense forest, where the thick trees provided plenty of cover. However, one of the members of the pursuing teams specialized in tracking, relentlessly chasing them down.</p><p>Now that the group had given up, Jiang and Mu could finally catch their breath. But they were also curious—why did the group suddenly stop after chasing them for so long?</p><p>\"Swish... Swish...\"</p><p>Just as they started to rest, the sound of movement in the bushes nearby put them on high alert. Jiang Tianming and Mu Tieren exchanged wary glances, preparing to fight back.</p><p>Even though it was two against twelve, the pair, who had both ranked in the top ten during the individual matches, stood a decent chance when working together.</p><p>But to their surprise, the figures emerging from the bushes had one golden and one red head of hair.</p><p>It was Su Bei and Mo Xiaotian!</p><p>Seeing them, Jiang Tianming and Mu Tieren were caught off guard. Still, they didn’t immediately let down their guard. They first checked their watches to confirm the map—sure enough, the two dots representing teammates were right next to them. Only then did they relax, knowing it really was their allies.</p><p>“Why are you two here? Wait—did you scare off the people chasing us?” Jiang Tianming blocked Mo Xiaotian, who was about to throw himself into a hug, and turned to ask Su Bei.</p><p>Su Bei nodded. “We eliminated one of their members. It seems eliminating someone gives you 10 points.”</p><p>Hearing this, Jiang Tianming glanced at the scoreboard and nodded knowingly. “10 points for eliminating a person and 50 points for killing a Nightmares. It looks like completing the missions is worth more than fighting alone.”</p><p>“Since there are no missions that require us to split up, we figured it would be better to regroup with you first,” Su Bei explained, scanning the surrounding area as he spoke. “My suggestion is that we don’t worry about gaining more points for the first two days and save it all for the second day.”</p><p>Jiang Tianming’s eyes lit up. “I was thinking the same thing!”</p><p>That’s why, after completing one task, he hadn’t taken any further action. Even when he spotted a Nightmares from a distance, he made sure to avoid it.</p><p>This realization came after Jiang Tianming killed his first Nightmares. He suddenly noticed that his mental power was recovering much more slowly than usual.</p><p>To recover mental power, one needed to meditate quietly or sleep. While doing routine, low-energy activities could also help, the recovery rate would be much slower.</p><p>Typically, Jiang Tianming could fully recover his mental power within a day. But in this environment, it could take a day and a half—even longer if he got into any fights during that time.</p><p>After noticing the slow recovery, Jiang Tianming decided it was better to conserve his energy and act on the second day. Otherwise, he’d risk becoming an easy target for others, which would be too embarrassing.</p><p>This was precisely what the academy wanted to teach them through these exercises. Real-life missions wouldn’t offer the same luxuries as the academy, where ability users had ample time to recover their mental power. Students had to learn how to manage their power efficiently and maximize its usage.</p><p>Su Bei hadn’t noticed this issue because his high-level mental power recovered faster and more easily, unaffected by the environment. Additionally, he had spent a large part of the day slacking off, so his energy was already mostly restored.</p><p>As for Mo Xiaotian, he hadn’t said anything because he simply hadn’t realized it. As a more instinct-driven fighter, Mo Xiaotian had barely used any mental power after his initial consumption upon entering the alternate space.n/ô/vel/b//in dot c//om</p><p>When Jiang Tianming explained his findings, both Su Bei and Mo Xiaotian had a sudden realization.</p><p>“Right! My mental power has also been recovering much slower! I didn’t even notice until you mentioned it!” Mo Xiaotian exclaimed, his eyes filled with admiration.</p><p>Su Bei was equally surprised, but he quickly deduced the reason for the slow recovery. He had experienced life with regular mental power before and knew that sufficient time and a quiet environment were necessary for recovery.</p><p>He chuckled and added, “I hadn’t noticed either. Good catch, you two.”</p><p>Of course, the truth was that Su Bei 'had' noticed—he simply wasn’t affected enough for it to matter.</p><p>Jiang Tianming and Mu Tieren clearly guessed this as well. They doubted someone as meticulous as Su Bei would miss something so crucial. However, neither of them called him out on it.</p><p>Instead, Mu Tieren asked curiously, “If you didn’t notice the issue with mental power recovery, why did you suggest not taking action for the first two days?”</p><p>Su Bei raised an eyebrow and smiled slyly, like a cunning fox. “If the neighbors stockpile food, I stockpile weapons. The neighbors are my food supply.”</p><p>At this point, it was already one o'clock in the morning. While teenagers their age were generally energetic and recovered quickly, and staying up late is not a big deal. But now, this was still a competition. A lack of energy would make it easy for others to sneak attack on them.</p><p>Su Bei looked around but couldn’t find a particularly safe place. It took too much time to build a simple residence, and there weren’t any caves in this forest area.</p><p>Sighing, he said, “Let's discuss the night watch first. I’m fine with any shift. I’ll start preparing a sleeping spot.”</p><p>Sleeping directly on the ground was out of the question. The cold could seep into their bodies, making them sick, and while there weren’t any large animals or birds in this area, insects were still a problem. Sleeping directly on the ground would turn them into a “human terrarium” by morning. At the very least, they needed a layer of leaves for insulation.</p><p>A campfire was also necessary. Although starting a fire in the dark might attract attention, it would provide warmth and visibility and could also help against enemies.</p><p>Su Bei can be called an old hand, worked quickly and efficiently. After finishing their discussion, the others came over to help.</p><p>It was clear that Su Bei and Mu Tieren were the most skilled among them. Jiang Tianming wasn’t as experienced but learned quickly. As for Mo Xiaotian, while neither skilled nor fast, he made for an excellent morale booster.</p><p>“Our final decision is for Xiaotian to take the first watch, followed by me, the class monitor, and lastly, you, Su Bei. Each shift is an hour and a half, and we’ll all get up at 8 a.m. Does that work?” Jiang Tianming said while gathering leaves.</p><p>Su Bei nodded nonchalantly, understanding that they were being considerate of him. The first and last watch shifts were usually the easiest, and he accepted their arrangement without fuss—after all, he was the one who started the fire, so it was only fair to earn some benefits in return.</p><p>Before long, the group had finished laying out the bedding, and Su Bei had the fire going. They each took turns standing watch, as agreed.</p><p>“Wake up…”</p><p>Mu Tieren’s voice roused Su Bei, who opened his eyes immediately, alert to his surroundings. Sleeping in a dangerous environment meant he was naturally a light sleeper.</p><p>Realizing the situation, Su Bei sat up and checked his watch. It was 6:30 a.m., right on time. He appreciated punctuality and disliked it when others let him sleep longer out of kindness—it only annoyed him.</p><p>After the shift change, Su Bei got up to stretch. While the plan was to take it easy today, based on his understanding of the competition, things were unlikely to remain peaceful.</p><p>Sure enough, by 7:30 a.m., Su Bei heard movement from above. Looking up, he spotted a pitch-black snake as thick as an adult’s arm, slowly slithering down a tree near Jiang Tianming.</p><p>The snake was long—so long that while its head nearly touched the ground, its tail was still hidden among the leaves. Su Bei estimated it to be at least five meters in length.</p><p>He immediately hurled a gear at it, but the snake dodged with lightning speed. Realizing it had been discovered, the snake abandoned stealth and lunged toward Jiang Tianming.</p><p>“Wake up!” Su Bei shouted, running over to kick Jiang Tianming awake before delivering a flying kick that sent the snake flying.</p><p>Thankfully, he was wearing the school’s specially-made uniform, which was highly durable. Without it, he wouldn’t have dared to kick the creature directly.</p><p>The commotion woke everyone, and they quickly got to their feet.</p><p>“What’s going on?” Jiang Tianming asked, following Su Bei’s gaze to see the snake, now raised halfway up and glaring at them menacingly.</p><p>Mo Xiaotian’s eyes widened. “That’s one big snake!”</p><p>The snake hissed, its upper body swaying as it searched for the best angle to strike.</p><p>“It’s fast,” Su Bei warned, his eyes sharp. “Xiaotian, trap it!”</p><p>“On it!” Mo Xiaotian shouted, creating ten transparent air blocks to serve as protective barriers around the group.</p><p>Meanwhile, Mu Tieren used his extracurricular knowledge to assess the threat. “This Nightmares probably isn’t venomous. According to the books, venomous Nightmare Snakes have disproportionately large heads. But I’m not sure what its ability might be.”</p><p>The lack of venom was good news, and everyone visibly relaxed. Jiang Tianming asked Su Bei for a few gears, and together they launched a coordinated attack. Keeping the saying “hit a snake at its seven-inch weak point” in mind, they aimed their attacks with precision.</p><p>Although the snake was fast, it couldn’t dodge all their attacks, especially with Mo Xiaotian’s air blocks limiting its movements. Before long, the Nightmare Snake was defeated.</p><p>Even after it fell, the group remained cautious, checking their watches to confirm they had gained the 50 points for killing the Nightmares before approaching.</p><p>Su Bei grabbed the snake by its tail and lifted it, inspecting it. “How about roasted snake for breakfast?”</p><p>Even ordinary snake meat was considered a delicacy, and Nightmare Snakes were renowned for their flavor.</p><p>Jiang Tianming couldn’t help but laugh. “With a snake this big, it’ll probably last us through lunch too.”</p><p>Mo Xiaotian cheered, “Awesome! Let me cook it! You’ll all see my grilling skills in action!”</p><p>“You know how to barbecue?” Mu Tieren teased with a smile. “Now I’m looking forward to it.”</p><p>Jiang Tianming, who was also a skilled cook, decided to let Mo Xiaotian take the lead this time, seeing how eager he was.</p><p>As Mo Xiaotian took the snake from Su Bei's hands, the excitement on his face gradually faded, replaced by a troubled expression.</p><p>“What’s wrong?” Mu Tieren asked considerately. “Is it because you’ve never prepared a snake and don’t know how to handle it?”</p><p>Mo Xiaotian shook his head, looking frustrated. “No, it’s just... it needs to be cleaned!”</p><p>A snake this big couldn’t simply be roasted directly. At the very least, it needed to be thoroughly cleaned with river water. Using bottled water like they had done before would be wasteful.</p><p>“We passed a river yesterday,” Jiang Tianming offered. “I still remember the way—it’s not too far from here. Let’s go together.”</p><p>Hearing this, Mu Tieren looked surprised. “You can still remember the route in this forest? I do recall seeing a river yesterday, but I’ve completely forgotten how to get there.”</p><p>Jiang Tianming gave a faint, complicated smile, one that hinted at a story behind it. “Yeah, remembering the way is important.”</p><p>Sensing his tone, Mu Tieren hesitated but chose not to press further. Although they were friends, they hadn’t reached the level where they could freely ask about each other’s private matters. If someone didn’t want to share, it was best not to ask.</p><p>Following Jiang Tianming’s lead, they walked for half an hour before the sound of rushing water reached their ears. However, it wasn’t just the sound of water—they could also hear voices.</p><p>“It seems there are quite a few people near the river,” Su Bei remarked knowingly.</p><p>This was understandable. Water was essential for survival, and even those with little wilderness experience would instinctively set up camp near a river.</p><p>Using his mental abilities, Su Bei sensed the situation and raised an eyebrow. “There are 15 people by the river, split into two groups.”</p><p>The others weren’t curious about how he knew this, and they collectively breathed a sigh of relief. Since the two groups there were coexisting peacefully, adding their team to the mix shouldn’t cause any issues.</p><p>As they emerged from the forest, they were immediately met with 15 pairs of eyes. Among them, a green-haired boy’s jaw dropped in surprise when he saw Su Bei. “It’s you!”</p><p>This was someone Su Bei had defeated in the first round of the individual battles.</p><p>Seeing a familiar face, Su Bei remained unbothered. He casually waved and greeted him, “Oh, what a coincidence.”</p><p>“Coincidence, my foot!” the green-haired boy shouted angrily. “Don’t you feel even a little guilty when you see me?”</p><p>Apparently, having been eliminated in the first round had left him resentful. After following Su Bei’s subsequent matches, he realized Su Bei wasn’t just reliant on trickery, as in their match—he was genuinely skilled.</p><p>Now, the green-haired boy didn’t feel as humiliated about losing to Su Bei. Though Su Bei was from Class F, his abilities clearly exceeded that rank. Losing to a Class F student was embarrassing, but losing to someone in the top 10 was not.</p><p>Still, the question lingered in his mind: why had Su Bei resorted to trickery in their match instead of using his true strength to secure a convincing win? It felt like mockery.</p><p>“You clearly could’ve beaten me outright, but instead, you chose to humiliate me,” the green-haired boy said, his voice tinged with both anger and hurt.</p><p>Su Bei: “...”</p><p>Was it possible that he really had no other option at the time?</p><p>Unfortunately, he couldn’t explain the truth, leaving the green-haired boy none the wiser. Su Bei sighed inwardly, ignored the accusations, and crouched by the riverbank. Looking at Mo Xiaotian, he said, “What are you standing around for? Come clean the snake!”</p><p>“Oh, right!” Mo Xiaotian snapped out of his daze, hurriedly carrying the giant snake over and starting to clean and prepare it.</p><p>The massive snake drew everyone’s attention, and those by the river couldn’t help but gulp. The green-haired boy stared at the Nightmare Snake, then back at Su Bei, his expression filled with disbelief. “Did you kill this?”</p><p>“It was a team effort,” Su Bei replied modestly.</p><p>Even so, his words were enough to leave the others stunned. While they could only flee from Nightmares, Su Bei’s team—comprised mostly of Class F students—had managed to kill one. It was incredible.</p><p>Realizing he had just been berating someone so powerful, the green-haired boy suddenly felt small. Clearing his throat, he said awkwardly, “Ahem, well, uh... you’re impressive. Let’s forget about what happened before.”</p><p>Having said that, he smugly thought he had both ensured his safety and saved face. However, his companions looked at him with disdain and quietly stepped away, for fear others would associate them with this guy.</p><p><i>Note:</i> <i>For sure, when the world’s in chaos, it’d be wild!
